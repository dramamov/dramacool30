Then why didn't you tell your girlfriend

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.550
and call us out?

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.500
I don't want to bring
this negative mood home.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.220
Friends, right?

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.617
Share the hardship together. Come.

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:08.750
Come on.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:34.790
Hi.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:42.740
The usual.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.830
He looks pretty loaded.

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.020
He's wearing a Maison Margiela coat.

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:53.420
What? You know him?

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.300
A friendly reminder.
Stay far away from that guy.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.460
You hate him that much?

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.460
What did he do?

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:02.580
It's not me who hates him.

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.070
Mr. Yu hates him.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.950
And it's not just Mr. Yu.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.950
Pretty much everyone hates him.

00:03:08.084 --> 00:03:10.706
You'll see for yourself in a minute.
He's really annoying.

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.180
A little sweet.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.950
Change the drink.

00:03:31.817 --> 00:03:33.180
Where'd you get that laptop?

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:34.990
From Zhong Liangchuan's office.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.350
Stop it. Go to sleep.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:37.740
I'm not messing around. I'm working.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.460
I can't let that Ou Yang win.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:40.550
You can't work right now.

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:41.420
You need to rest.

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:42.630
Leave me alone.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.630
I'm a doctor. That's an order.

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.580
You have the three highs,
and you fainted.

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:54.900
If you don't rest and get treated,

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:55.995
it could get very serious.

00:03:55.995 --> 00:03:56.900
You'll regret it.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:58.670
You don't get it.

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.270
My work means everything to me.

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:01.740
My entire life

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.620
revolves around my work, okay?

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:04.684
Quit the grandstanding.

00:04:04.728 --> 00:04:06.140
You think that Ou Yang is going

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.990
to steal your project.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.860
Of course not.

00:04:08.173 --> 00:04:10.862
I just don't want my design
to get deleted or rewritten.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.260
Then, you need to rest even more.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:20.990
If you collapse,

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:22.260
the project really will be gone.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:23.740
But if you rest up

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:24.710
and come back fresh,

00:04:24.973 --> 00:04:26.350
I'm sure that Ou Yang won't be

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.500
a match for you.

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:33.590
True.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.710
Go to sleep. Good night.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.440
Who is it?

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.290
It's me.

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.740
I brought you some of

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.670
Cantonese slow-simmered soup.

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.795
The one you have to
wait an hour in line for.

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.150
Still mad at me?

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:22.940
You'll definitely like this.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.540
(A Classic for Everyone)

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.260
You borrowed it from me.

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.110
I mean the songs recorded on the tape.

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.350
They're all your favorites.

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:38.820
Trying to soften me up?

00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:41.940
The sweet spot of this approach is

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.440
that the contract is already signed,

00:05:43.484 --> 00:05:44.640
and the schedule is fixed.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:45.860
I have to make sure

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.590
this project goes smoothly.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.590
But Wu can't handle something this big.

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.230
The only person
I have right now who can finish it

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:53.110
is Ou Yang.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.150
So let Ou Yang take over.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:56.860
You just focus on getting better.

00:05:57.062 --> 00:05:59.910
I already told Ou Yang to keep
as much of your design as possible.

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.150
And in future design cycles,

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:04.670
try to leave some room for flexibility.

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:09.110
What did the client say?

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:11.940
The client? The client

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:13.230
didn't say much.

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:14.710
I can handle it.

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:16.262
What do you mean you can handle it?

00:06:16.262 --> 00:06:17.180
Is something going on?

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:18.350
What could be going on?

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:19.740
I can handle it.

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.380
I'm heading out. Drink the soup.

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:23.820
And eat the fruit.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:45.670
Why are you home?

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:48.740
Got into a fight with Mr. Yu.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.110
You fought with Mr. Yu?

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:50.950
What happened?

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:53.470
He just snapped at me for no reason.

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:54.550
He said he wanted me gone.

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:56.710
What?

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:58.110
Who cares what he wants?

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:59.380
I'm never going back again.

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:09.900
Coming.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.110
Mr. Yu?

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:17.590
Not working today?

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:21.260
I have the afternoon off.

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:22.310
Where's Wu?

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:24.670
He just went in.
Want me to call him out?

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:25.510
No need.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:27.860
Go tell him

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:28.860
I don't need him.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.740
He actually handed my design
to Ou Yang and let him mess it up.

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:35.620
Yeah, that's on him.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:38.910
Not entirely on him.

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:41.260
It was probably Lin Sa's idea.

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:44.060
Those two didn't want me working.

00:07:44.128 --> 00:07:45.420
They were afraid I'd overwork.

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:48.300
But Wu talked back to me.

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:49.860
That was too rude.

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:52.590
If he talked back, that's his fault.

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:53.940
Not necessarily.

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:56.300
I was the one who scolded him first.

00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:57.860
I pushed him too hard,

00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:59.740
so blurting things out
was understandable.

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:01.590
And he wasn't insulting me.

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:03.180
He just wanted me to rest.

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:06.620
Then, what exactly did he do wrong?

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:07.670
Everything.

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:10.030
He's been with me for years,

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:11.990
and his skills haven't improved at all.

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:13.670
Though I get it,

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:16.670
he just doesn't have my level of talent.

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:20.500
At least he works hard most of the time.

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:22.910
He helps me
with all kinds of random tasks.

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:24.030
That saves me some trouble.

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:26.350
With him suddenly disappeared,

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:28.990
I'd feel a bit off.

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.710
Like a computer losing its mouse.

00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:33.350
Sure, it still works,

00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:34.620
but not efficiently.

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:36.500
So...

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:37.860
Nothing more. I'm leaving.

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:50.900
What did he mean by that?

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:52.740
He was apologizing.

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:55.140
That counts as an apology?

00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:59.590
It's already rare
for Mr. Yu to show up in person.

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:00.900
By the way, Xiaoxiao,

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:02.928
I'm getting changed
and heading to work.

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:05.860
You said you wouldn't go back,
no matter what he did?

00:09:05.951 --> 00:09:06.990
Already changed your mind?

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:08.830
When I'm coaxing you, it takes forever.

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:12.070
Guys don't overthink stuff like that.

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:14.710
The door is open.

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:18.340
Open up!

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:43.460
(Incoming call: Gu Yejia)

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:56.020
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:57.780
I shouldn't have run away.

00:09:57.950 --> 00:09:58.790
Okay?

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:00.110
I said I was wrong. There.

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:02.070
- You lost something, didn't you?
- Huh?

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:02.950
A USB drive.

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:05.740
It says "Yu Yu Design Studio" on it.

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:07.017
So you're the one who took it.

00:10:07.017 --> 00:10:08.950
You can't work without that thing.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:10.110
Indeed.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:11.310
Well, if you're that desperate,

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:12.710
I can bring it over to you.

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:14.900
As long as you agree to one condition.

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:15.780
Say it.

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:16.780
Let me into your place.

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:20.190
You want to come
into my place that badly?

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:22.528
Or you can come to the hospital
and pick it up yourself.

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:24.590
I don't have time right now.

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:26.540
Either you come, or I go.

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:27.830
Your choice.

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:34.380
Come here.

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:36.380
Open the door, then.

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:37.220
Huh?

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:41.070
Seriously?

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:46.950
Hi.

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:52.110
Where is it?

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:53.110
I brought it.

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:54.470
Your turn.

00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:58.030
Jia.

00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:59.740
- Xiaoman?
- What are you doing here?

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:00.830
- I was doing...
- Bye.

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:02.310
Why you...

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:03.830
Yu Yu! Let me in!

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.830
Yu Yu! Open the door!

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:12.620
Well...

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:30.790
Finally.

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:37.590
You're here to treat him?

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:38.430
Yeah.

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:39.470
He's still recovering,

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:41.780
but he just ran out of the hospital
for no reason.

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:42.950
I was furious.

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:44.260
I almost got inside just now.

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:48.350
Sorry about that.

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:49.430
It's not your fault.

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:52.590
He's jumpy
and weird and can't keep a promise.

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:55.540
But honestly,

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:56.950
what exactly is he hiding

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:59.140
in his apartment?

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:01.140
Why so mysterious?

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:03.990
I just think it's kind of fun.

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:11.020
- Come in.
- Never mind.

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:12.260
I'm here to ask for help.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:13.990
Whatever it is, come inside first.

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:14.900
Jia is here.

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:17.110
Dr. Gu is here too?

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:18.500
Wu.

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:20.470
You know Mr. Yu pretty well.

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:22.020
Lin said earlier

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:24.110
that he ran home
from the hospital to work again.

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:25.140
I want to help him,

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:26.140
but he'll yell at me.

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:26.980
You know,

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:28.380
just go knock on the door.

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:29.860
He'll definitely open it for you.

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:30.740
And then?

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:31.860
Then, you barge right in.

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:33.660
And he'll kick you right back out.

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:34.570
Then, you come here.

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:36.040
Tell us what's inside his place.

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:39.020
Seriously, Dr. Gu,
since when are you unreliable too?

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:41.260
Great, I think his craziness is
rubbing off on me.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:45.900
What is this?

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:47.470
Did he switch to percussion music?

00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:48.990
Did he faint again?

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:52.830
He's not that fragile, right?

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:58.620
Mr. Yu?

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:00.470
- Mr. Yu, open up!
- Mr. Yu?

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:01.430
Mr. Yu!

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:04.740
What do we do? He's not responding.

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:08.110
The balcony! The balcony!

00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:11.110
- Yu...
- Climb across from here.

00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:12.310
Yeah, yeah, climb over.

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:13.470
Are you two crazy?

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:15.573
It's the seventh floor!
How am I supposed to do it?

00:13:15.573 --> 00:13:16.230
Forget that.

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:18.830
He shaved a 54-centimeter wall
down by 14 centimeters.

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:20.590
And he replaced
the soundproofing material.

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:23.740
Do you guys have a hammer?

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:26.580
This one.

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:30.980
Dr. Gu.

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:32.660
You're way too hardcore.

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:35.500
Let me do it.

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:39.380
Careful.

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:44.990
Is this okay?

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:45.860
Mr. Yu said

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:47.780
this wall was thinned
by Xia Xiaoman's uncle.

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:49.660
My uncle actually did something useful.

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:50.950
Okay, it's through!

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:00.140
- Let's go.
- Okay.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.590
- Mr. Yu!
- Mr. Yu!

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:11.500
- Mr. Yu!
- Mr. Yu!

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:14.350
Mr. Yu!

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:15.430
(You have been surrounded.)

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:17.660
(Put down your weapons and kneel.)

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:20.900
(You have been surrounded.)

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:22.140
- Yu...
- (Kneel...)

00:14:22.528 --> 00:14:23.620
(You have been surrounded.)

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:24.540
Mr. Yu!

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:26.110
(Put down your weapons and kneel.)

00:14:26.862 --> 00:14:28.900
- (You have been surrounded.)
- What happened?

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:30.470
(Put down your weapons and kneel.)

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:32.710
(You have been surrounded.)

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:34.900
(Put down your weapons and kneel.)

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:47.780
What are you doing?
You even smashed a hole in my wall!

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:49.660
You fainted.

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:50.780
We came to save you.

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:51.990
Then, why are you here?

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:53.150
I...

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:55.900
He was working.

00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:58.230
He cares about you. Don't yell at him.

00:14:58.540 --> 00:14:59.620
Why would I yell at him?

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:01.540
Am I that unreasonable?

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:03.590
If you really want to help,

00:15:03.684 --> 00:15:05.260
go to the studio tomorrow morning.

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:06.580
Got it.

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.540
Alright, I'm getting back to work.

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:09.620
You're still working?

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:10.830
You just fainted!

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:11.830
When did I faint?

00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:12.710
Just now!

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:14.020
That was a sleep faint.

00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:17.540
Okay, everyone, off the balcony.

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:19.500
- Go.
- Got it.

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:20.380
Dao, go.

00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:25.910
Why are you hiding here? Out.

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:30.190
Out.

00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:31.030
Go outside.

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:33.540
Go on. Hurry.

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:48.350
When did you get in here?

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:50.110
I said no one is allowed in my room.

00:15:50.128 --> 00:15:51.310
- I'm not leaving.
- Get out.

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:52.540
You're a responsible designer.

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:53.620
I'm a responsible doctor.

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:54.660
Responsibly speaking,

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:56.499
overworking can cause
cardiovascular issues,

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:57.990
cerebral hemorrhage, and heart attacks,

00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:59.190
which are very dangerous.

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:13.710
Checkup or not, it's up to you.

00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:23.500
Don't move.

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:24.528
(Measurement complete.)

00:17:24.551 --> 00:17:27.300
(Systolic pressure: 127 mmHg.)

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:29.740
(Diastolic pressure: 91 mmHg.)

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:32.060
(Pulse: 82 beats per minute.)

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:33.710
(Your diastolic is a bit high.)

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:35.020
So?

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:36.870
Blood pressure
and heart rate are a bit off.

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:39.020
But they're within
the safe range for now.

00:17:39.573 --> 00:17:40.910
Your oxygen levels are normal.

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:47.740
Just now...

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:50.150
I didn't actually faint.

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:51.340
I just fell asleep.

00:17:52.128 --> 00:17:54.150
You fell asleep
with a loud thud like that?

00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:56.750
I was exhausted.

00:17:57.528 --> 00:17:59.190
I didn't feel like picking up the chair.

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:06.510
Take your medicine.

00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:10.150
How do you know I need these?

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:11.595
And you even carry them with you.

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.060
Next time you leave the hospital,

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:15.340
take your medication.

00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:26.060
I'll get going then.

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:33.990
My shoes.

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:35.030
Right.

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:36.260
I'll walk you out.

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:56.510
See you.

00:18:58.950 --> 00:18:59.790
By the way,

00:18:59.862 --> 00:19:01.973
we'll make you food
and bring it over later.

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:04.340
Use the front door.

00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:06.070
Okay.

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:17.820
So...

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:19.260
Mr. Yu's room...

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:20.950
What does it look like?

00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:26.910
Honestly, nothing special.

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:28.710
I remember

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:30.710
there's a desk.

00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:33.340
With a computer on it.

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:37.430
I was too focused on treating him.

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:41.500
I didn't really notice anything else.

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:55.580
It's not symphony music.

00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:57.910
It actually sounds pretty good.

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:00.670
Let me try identifying it with an app.

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:07.230
Got it.

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:10.870
Never heard of it.

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:12.870
"Merci".

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:14.910
It means "thank you" in French.

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:20.470
He really is way too deep
and subtle with his expression.

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:54.260
This is amazing!

00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:55.870
Living in such a warm, cozy place

00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:57.740
is going to make life so pleasant.

00:20:58.620 --> 00:20:59.470
Where's Mr. Yu?

00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:00.470
I want to thank him.

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:01.950
He's on leave.

00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:13.950
You're awake.

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:15.470
Did you like the food we brought?

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:16.580
Did you eat?

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:27.550
It's too salty.

00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:29.300
Don't cook that for anyone else.

00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:30.910
You'll salt them to death.

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:33.670
Biting the hand that feeds you.

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:35.910
What's wrong, Dr. Gu?

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:37.950
Nothing.

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:38.790
Okay.

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:13.340
Cousin.

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:14.950
Welcome.

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:17.630
Well...

00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:18.790
My condolences.

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:20.270
Huh?

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:23.740
What's with that flower?

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:26.230
I'm getting married.

00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:27.580
Married?

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:28.420
So Uncle's not dead?

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:32.300
(Groom: Su Yuanliang,
Bride: Bao Qianqian)

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:37.380
Sir.

00:23:37.484 --> 00:23:38.751
(Funeral tribute)
Where should I put this?

00:23:38.773 --> 00:23:39.430
Yeah, where?

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:40.820
Oh my god, man...

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:44.380
(Wedding)

00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:45.973
Sir, perhaps if you pay a little extra,

00:23:46.017 --> 00:23:48.470
I can disassemble the wreath
and turn it into a flower basket.

00:23:48.551 --> 00:23:49.620
How about that?

00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:51.180
Good idea.

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:52.860
Thank you.

00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:56.420
Wedding gift.

00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:58.150
Thanks.

00:23:58.150 --> 00:23:58.990
No problem.

00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:01.500
I don't need the envelope.

00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:02.670
The color is

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:03.630
too pure.

00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:05.710
The amount I gave you

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:07.630
is 1314 yuan.

00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:08.950
It's a homophone for "forever".

00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:10.110
What was it originally?

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:10.950
1688.

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:12.060
That's lucky.

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:13.390
- "Get rich all the way".
- Nope.

00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:14.470
It's "goodbye all the way".

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:18.190
I was actually thinking
of giving 886 yuan.

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:20.780
But I thought it was too little.
And "bye-bye"

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:23.470
is a homophone that isn't exactly
respectful for the deceased.

00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:25.910
There isn't a deceased.

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:28.260
Where's the wreath? Where did it go?

00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:32.990
Your ex threatened me last month,
saying she'd send a wreath.

00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:34.780
And she really sent one? Get them!

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:36.100
A misunderstanding!

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:36.990
What misunderstanding?

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:38.100
Look at the occasion today!

00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:38.950
This is outrageous.

00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:40.430
He's my distant cousin.

00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:42.430
She said
she was your distant cousin too.

00:24:42.551 --> 00:24:44.190
Wouldn't that make her his real sister?

00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:45.780
No, my sister already got married!

00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:47.190
It's even worse!

00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:48.500
Did you cheat with my sister?

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:50.950
Can we not go
full soap opera right now?

00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:52.300
You need to explain!

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:53.500
Kiddo...

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:54.670
What are you...

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:19.340
Son.

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:22.990
Your uncle passed.

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:26.060
You have to come
for the seventh-day rites.

00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:28.630
Is that my fault?

00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:29.630
It is my fault.

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:31.462
In what context

00:25:31.506 --> 00:25:32.820
would you invite me to a wedding,

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:34.300
and include the words "seventh day"?

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:36.500
What I meant was,

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:38.020
your uncle's son is getting married.

00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:39.820
All the relatives and friends went.

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:41.470
Seven bridesmaids in the bridal suite.

00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:42.540
You had to come!

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:43.380
I...

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:48.020
- Hello?
- Why aren't you here yet?

00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:48.870
The client is here.

00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:49.740
I'm coming!

00:25:50.551 --> 00:25:52.300
- Mom, I'm leaving!
- Where are you going?

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:53.950
- Work emergency!
- No, no, no!

00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:55.740
Go apologize right now!

00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:57.100
Or he'll hate you forever!

00:25:57.990 --> 00:26:00.060
And you can't go dressed all in black.

00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:05.910
Here, wear this and go apologize.

00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:07.020
Again?

00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:07.910
Go, go, go.

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:08.750
You have to.

00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:31.740
Mr. Yu believes that

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:34.740
dressing festively is the greatest
respect you can show a client.

00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:38.060
Yes. Back in the day,
when raising the main beam,

00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:39.340
everyone had to wear bright red.

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:42.060
Let's continue.

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:45.990
How many bathrooms are
the four of you planning to install?

00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:47.470
Two.

00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:50.390
Why would one family living together
need two bathrooms?

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.240
Exactly.

00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:53.670
You could turn one into a storage room.
It's more practical.

00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:55.470
We're not exactly a wealthy family.

00:26:55.670 --> 00:26:56.670
Having an extra bathroom

00:26:56.910 --> 00:26:59.390
is basically wasting
hundreds of thousands of house money.

00:26:59.462 --> 00:27:01.751
Fine, then at least give me
good soundproofing.

00:27:01.862 --> 00:27:02.780
No problem.

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:05.540
It'll add about
100 grand to the budget.

00:27:06.670 --> 00:27:08.100
A hundred grand?

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:09.580
Hey, honey.

00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:12.390
For that money,
we could get a local license plate.

00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:15.070
Alright then.

00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:17.260
Housing prices are so insane now.

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:21.390
Living with your parents
after marriage is totally normal.

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:23.630
You could buy a place in another city.

00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:26.430
No one likes
moving away from home, Mr. Yu.

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:28.340
Housing is a necessity.

00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:30.470
Big cities are also a necessity.

00:27:30.884 --> 00:27:32.540
Then, be ready
to fight every day at home.

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:36.150
Good thing my parents don't
plan on living with me.

00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:37.910
After you get married,

00:27:37.910 --> 00:27:40.120
it's not just your parents.
There are her parents too.

00:27:40.390 --> 00:27:41.260
Oh, right.

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:42.950
"Oh, right"?

00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:44.950
Do you hate my parents that much?

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:46.580
I never said that.

00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:48.100
Don't mix up two different things.

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:49.190
After marriage,

00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:50.951
you don't just gain
another set of parents.

00:27:50.995 --> 00:27:52.870
It's double the relatives too.

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:54.710
Like your third-cousin–great-uncle,

00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:56.195
or your great-aunt on your Mom's side.

00:27:56.262 --> 00:27:57.540
The client is an only child.

00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:01.740
I actually want to live
with my mother-in-law after marriage.

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:03.150
Calling my in-law "Mom" every day

00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:04.150
sounds fun.

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:06.540
With how dominant you are,

00:28:06.551 --> 00:28:08.551
she'll be calling you
"mommy" in three months.

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:09.990
Not even three months.

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:10.990
Three days will do.

00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:13.910
You're wearing bright red,

00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:15.780
but your mouth is still just as mean.

00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:17.070
Xiaoxiao.

00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:18.820
I got the stuff.

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:20.420
Oh, right.

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:22.580
Is it new?

00:28:23.150 --> 00:28:26.150
No, it's something I bought for Qing.

00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:27.620
Wow.

00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:28.820
It's really pretty.

00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:30.060
Yeah, it is.

00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:32.300
I'll buy you an even prettier one.

00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:37.190
You're so stingy.
How would you ever buy me one?

00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:39.710
I'm not stingy.

00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:40.780
I just never get a raise.

00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:41.820
Right, Mr. Yu?

00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:42.990
I'm leaving.

00:28:42.995 --> 00:28:44.550
- Where are you going now?
- Yeah, where?

00:28:44.551 --> 00:28:45.230
To escape reality?

00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:46.100
Spending my money.

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:03.100
Why are you giving yourself a CT scan?

00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:05.120
I got hit.

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:06.150
My head feels a bit dizzy.

00:29:06.910 --> 00:29:08.100
Why'd someone hit you?

00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:10.540
Is it a concussion or not?

00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:14.340
No. Everything looks normal.

00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:15.340
Really?

00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:17.030
I don't believe you.

00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:19.950
Then, go find a doctor you do trust.

00:29:23.351 --> 00:29:24.780
Drink water and get plenty of rest.

00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:26.150
Your dizziness will go away.

00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:30.740
Can't even diagnose a concussion...

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:32.470
I shouldn't have come to you.

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:34.340
Now I get why someone hit you.

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:36.580
You've got it all wrong.

00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:39.990
The truth comes
from a voice note my mom sent me.

00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:40.830
Listen to this.

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:42.840
(Zhongjing Hospital Prescription)
I prescribed you Vitamin D9 and B12.

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:43.773
You can pick up the meds.

00:29:43.910 --> 00:29:44.750
This is...

00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:52.230
Bye.

00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:05.710
Miss,

00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:08.340
why's the AC turned up so high?

00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:10.580
Because someone feels cold.

00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:11.580
But I feel hot.

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:12.780
I'm sweating all over.

00:30:12.910 --> 00:30:14.340
What I walk out and catch a cold?

00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:17.780
How about you talk to that gentleman
and let me know

00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:19.580
what temperature you agree on?

00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:28.230
Sir.

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:30.740
Don't you think
the AC is set way too high?

00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:32.430
It's like 27 or 28 degrees in here.

00:30:32.573 --> 00:30:34.773
(Blind Date Resume)
As you age, your body runs colder.

00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:38.190
Once you reach my age,
you'll understand.

00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:39.260
Runs colder?

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:43.740
Your legs, your back, and your lungs.
Everything runs a bit colder.

00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:45.340
Oh, real scientific.

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:03.870
Judging by how you look,
you're not that young anymore.

00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:07.060
Do you ever get this feeling

00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:09.300
that no matter how warm or cold it is,

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:14.230
your hands and feet get chilly at night?

00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:15.100
Nope.

00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:16.430
I'm only forty.

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:17.430
Forty?

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:20.300
Now, look at him.

00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:22.670
He is forty,

00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:25.100
but he looks like he's in his thirties.

00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:28.710
You really haven't
taken care of yourself.

00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:30.340
You're aging way too fast.

00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:33.580
You...

00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:35.100
Why are you two sitting together?

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:35.990
And you're chatting?

00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:37.030
What?

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:40.300
- Yejia.
- What are you doing here?

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:42.300
Pick one of these
and go on a blind date.

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:43.630
No, no, I don't want to!

00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:45.190
- You came here to set me up?
- Take it.

00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:46.060
You made me a booklet?

00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:47.910
- This is the resume collection!
- I don't want it! No!

00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:48.770
Take it.

00:31:48.770 --> 00:31:50.430
Just take it home!

00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:52.140
Who's he?

00:31:53.390 --> 00:31:54.780
- He's my dad.
- Huh?

00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:55.710
And you are?

00:31:55.710 --> 00:31:56.550
I...

00:31:57.580 --> 00:31:58.670
He's one of my patients.

00:31:58.906 --> 00:32:00.500
He needs treatment for a concussion.

00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:03.140
Wait...

00:32:03.351 --> 00:32:04.500
Do me a favor. Stop him.

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:05.950
What favor? Hey, what are you doing?

00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:07.670
Who is he exactly?

00:32:07.670 --> 00:32:08.630
My boyfriend.

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:10.260
- Boyfriend?
- I must get going.

00:32:12.150 --> 00:32:13.150
Boyfriend?

00:32:13.910 --> 00:32:14.750
What's your name?

00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:16.820
I'm Yu. Yu Yu.

00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:18.630
"Yu" as in what?

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:19.740
Yu, like Yu Boya.

00:32:20.150 --> 00:32:21.670
Yu Boya? Never heard of him.

00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:24.100
The one who played the zither.
His soulmate died,

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:25.630
and he smashed his instrument.

00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:27.540
He originally had the surname Bo.

00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:28.670
His real name was Yu Rui,

00:32:28.670 --> 00:32:29.580
styled Boya.

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:32.870
The whole "Yu Boya" thing was made up by
Feng Menglong in a Ming-dynasty novel.

00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:33.940
Really?

00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:35.870
- I don't believe it.
- I'm telling you,

00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:37.540
Xunzi, Ciyuan... They all say...

00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:38.630
Wait, I'm not her boyfriend.

00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:39.710
It's written clearly!

00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:40.790
He...

00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:42.740
His surname is Bo.

00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:46.700
(Yu Yu Design Studio)

00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:05.000
- Hey.
- Yeah?

00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:07.870
That Ou Yang guy posted
another short video.

00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:11.260
I mixed a new cocktail.

00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:12.470
Care to try it?

00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:20.780
Doesn't taste great.

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:22.780
It tastes like chicken poop.

00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:23.870
Look at that bracelet.

00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:26.500
Isn't that the one
Xiaoxiao bought for Qing?

00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:28.230
It really looks like it.

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:31.020
What now?

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:32.300
Spacing out again at work?

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:34.062
Leaving me alone
to deal with the client?

00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:36.620
Tell me.

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:38.670
What exactly is going on
between you and Ou Yang?

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:43.980
(Wildebeest Space)

00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:45.820
I only went out with him once.

00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:47.340
Just once?

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:48.390
Of course.

00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:49.230
The guy is so wild.

00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:50.580
I kept my guard up.

00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:52.470
And while he went to the bathroom,

00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:53.780
I called his phone.

00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:55.500
On his caller ID,

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.540
my name had "Shanghai" tagged after it.

00:33:59.020 --> 00:33:59.860
I get it.

00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:02.470
He's a high-level player.

00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:04.670
What does "Shanghai" even mean?

00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:05.670
You wouldn't get it.

00:34:05.670 --> 00:34:07.020
It's just a city.

00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:08.180
You really don't get it?

00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:10.390
Forget it. You're no "player".
You won't understand.

00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:12.390
Didn't Wu already say

00:34:12.390 --> 00:34:13.540
that the guy is unreliable?

00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:14.773
Why are you still seeing him?

00:34:14.817 --> 00:34:16.910
It's fine, I'm craftier.

00:34:17.180 --> 00:34:18.790
Besides, we're both single.

00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:20.270
He treats me pretty well.

00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:22.270
And he has a few impressive traits.

00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:24.100
So for now, we'll just keep in touch.

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:26.910
Does that mean you two are dating?

00:34:26.910 --> 00:34:28.100
Of course not.

00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:30.990
We're just playing a high-level game.

00:34:32.830 --> 00:34:37.270
Qing really is a high-level player.

00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:39.100
Alright then,
guess we were overthinking.

00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:40.350
Sorry for worrying you.

00:34:40.350 --> 00:34:41.870
Dinner's on me tonight.

00:34:44.751 --> 00:34:45.830
I'll send you a voucher.

00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:49.110
Come on.

00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:58.340
Jia.

00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:02.310
Dad.

00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:04.020
You haven't gone back to Suzhou?

00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:06.220
Of course I haven't left.

00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:08.790
We haven't finished talking.

00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:10.180
Talking about what?

00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:11.750
Well, you see...

00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:15.620
You and that Yu Yu...

00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:16.750
Dad.

00:35:17.350 --> 00:35:20.390
I've already hit
my three-dates-a-month quota.

00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:23.950
Can we please
save this topic for next month?

00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:25.470
Yes, but...

00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:26.900
But listen.

00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:27.990
This...

00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:30.060
This "quota" thing is made up
by people anyway.

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:31.500
Let's talk inside.

00:35:32.528 --> 00:35:34.500
I just remembered
I have work at the hospital.

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:36.830
I need to go handle it.

00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:38.750
Go watch a movie inside.

00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:40.700
I'm on night shift, so I won't be back.

00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:42.100
We'll talk another day, bye!

00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:43.950
Take care of yourself!

00:35:51.573 --> 00:35:52.750
I can't take it anymore.

00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:55.220
I can't stand my dad anymore.

00:35:55.350 --> 00:35:57.580
I just want a few peaceful days.

00:35:57.580 --> 00:35:58.870
Am I really asking too much?

00:35:59.270 --> 00:36:00.700
He pushed me so hard today.

00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:02.540
And Yu Yu happened to be
right next to me.

00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:04.620
So I pointed at him
and said he's my boyfriend.

00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:06.951
- And he believed it?
- He can believe whatever he wants.

00:36:08.106 --> 00:36:09.684
Where's "The Great Escape"?

00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:10.630
There.

00:36:13.870 --> 00:36:14.990
I saw it first.

00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:16.910
I got here five minutes earlier.

00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:20.020
He got here five minutes earlier.

00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:23.350
This is the Blu-ray version.

00:36:23.350 --> 00:36:25.020
Don't rent it unless you can play it.

00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:27.700
My laptop has a Blu-ray drive.

00:36:27.730 --> 00:36:30.750
And I can always watch it
at your girlfriend's place.

00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:34.310
Hey, why did you walk off?

00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:41.950
He set up video blind dates for me.

00:36:41.950 --> 00:36:43.830
And he made me see six people at once.

00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:45.950
Six people in six boxes on one screen.

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:47.430
Who does that?

00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:49.380
I...

00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:04.390
You're a patient.

00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:05.470
You can't drink.

00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:08.020
I'm not sick.

00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:09.830
Didn't you have a concussion?

00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:11.390
Next to the Governor Vessel

00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:14.540
are the Bladder Meridian
and the Stomach Meridian.

00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:16.350
If you drink just one beer,

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:19.910
your head will hurt all night.

00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:21.020
What exactly do you do?

00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:23.910
I study wellness.

00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:25.870
You don't believe me.

00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:27.310
I believe you.

00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:28.870
Then, I'll drink this.

00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:30.990
Leek, fennel, whatever this juice is.

00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:32.950
Is this even meant for humans?

00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:40.580
Honestly, I think your dad means well.

00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:43.430
I actually wish someone
would set up dates for me.

00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:45.140
It's just that

00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:46.790
my family isn't in a hurry.

00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:48.270
I'm the only one worrying.

00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:50.180
It's okay.

00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:51.020
I'll arrange for you.

00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:53.820
(Blind Date Resume)

00:37:53.830 --> 00:37:54.670
Pick anyone you like.

00:37:57.780 --> 00:37:59.340
(Wang Hongyu, 38)

00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:02.700
(Sun Guangchang, 40)

00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:07.350
I think they're pretty decent.

00:38:07.350 --> 00:38:08.470
Oh, really?

00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:10.100
It's just that for me,

00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:11.390
they're a little too old.

00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:15.220
Let me tell you something, Xiaoman.

00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:19.390
A lot of these older, still-single guys

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:21.350
actually have big problems.

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:23.700
I've met plenty of them on blind dates.

00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:25.060
For example,

00:38:25.350 --> 00:38:27.950
there are the ones who say,

00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:31.020
"It's because of work and my career."

00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:32.580
But really, they're just jerks.

00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:34.390
They keep dating endlessly,

00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:36.350
using blind dates
as an excuse to flirt.

00:38:36.750 --> 00:38:39.950
And then you have the mama's boys.

00:38:40.195 --> 00:38:41.660
They always listen to their mom.

00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:43.270
What to eat, drink, wear,

00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:45.020
even what kind of wife to marry.

00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:46.430
As long as the mom likes her,

00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:47.706
his own opinion doesn't matter.

00:38:47.790 --> 00:38:49.830
And there are the weird ones.
Hard to talk to,

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:51.328
impossible to get along with.

00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:54.540
Like my next-door neighbor.

00:38:54.830 --> 00:38:56.060
He wears a strange hat,

00:38:56.620 --> 00:38:57.750
wandering around everywhere.

00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:08.100
Why are you following me?

00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:09.950
My hotel's up ahead.

00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:11.220
Then go first.

00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:12.900
Okay.

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:22.020
What's your relationship
with my daughter?

00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:24.470
I am her patient.

00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:26.180
Not close?

00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:27.790
Yes.

00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:29.750
Why would you lie to me with her?

00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:33.180
We're friends, I guess.

00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:35.140
Friends?

00:39:36.830 --> 00:39:38.020
How did you meet?

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:40.470
I'd rather not say.

00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:51.060
You seem to be my daughter's

00:39:51.310 --> 00:39:53.700
only male friend.

00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:55.710
The only one?

00:39:57.310 --> 00:39:58.180
Mr. Yu.

00:39:58.910 --> 00:40:00.140
I'd like to ask you a favor.

00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:01.110
What kind of favor?

00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:04.420
Well, look...

00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:08.020
Jia's all alone in Shanghai.
It gets lonely.

00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:11.700
And you're her only

00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:14.470
male friend.

00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:16.910
Plus, you two live so close.

00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:18.230
So...

00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:19.830
So...

00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:21.100
What are you trying to say?

00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:22.580
I want you to take her on a date.

00:40:23.310 --> 00:40:24.220
A date?

00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:29.220
Ta-da.

00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:31.660
Freshly ground five-grain soy milk.

00:40:33.350 --> 00:40:34.270
Try it.

00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:38.220
It smells amazing.

00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:40.350
Xiaoman, you're so good at this.

00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:41.950
Any man will be lucky

00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:43.140
to marry you.

00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:44.270
Of course.

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:46.940
(Incoming call: Yu Yu)

00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:50.470
Mr. Yu is calling me.

00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:51.990
This early?

00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:53.460
Hello?

00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:54.460
Uh...

00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:55.940
Jia.

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:01.500
What's going on with you?

00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:03.100
Nothing's going on.

00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:04.980
I want to see you.

00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:06.270
How about 1 PM?

00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:07.470
The usual place.

00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:09.140
I live right next door.

00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:10.470
Why do you need to see me?

00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:11.390
No reason.

00:41:11.390 --> 00:41:14.790
I just really want to see you.

00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:16.860
See you there.

00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:23.830
Mr. Yu called and said
he wants to see me.

00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:29.950
Maybe he seriously wants to ask you out.

00:41:30.310 --> 00:41:31.310
No way.

00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:33.100
What if he confesses?

00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:34.270
Impossible.

00:41:34.270 --> 00:41:35.150
What if?

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:36.390
Still impossible.

00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:40.950
Come on. Tell us how you feel right now.

00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:45.910
I think he's acting weird.

00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:48.790
People like him

00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:50.470
must be handled with weird tactics.

00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:52.500
What tactics?

00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:25.590
Wow.

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:27.940
Alright.

00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:30.580
Why are you so eager to see me?

00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:39.830
Jia.

00:42:39.830 --> 00:42:40.700
If you call me that...

00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:41.540
Okay, stop.

00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:48.540
Jia.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.119
