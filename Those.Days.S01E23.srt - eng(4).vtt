=Those Days=

00:01:12.431 --> 00:01:14.800
(Adapted from iceread.com novel
"You Xi" by Qingyang Wanxi)

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.980
=Episode 23=

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.940
You're awake.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:30.940
Is my baby okay?

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.380
Now you remember you're pregnant?

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.140
The fetal heartbeat
was a little fast.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.060
I gave you some oxygen.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.020
It's back to normal now.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.020
So everything's fine?

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.300
For now, yes.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.360
Are you still feeling uncomfortable?

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.220
No.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.420
I need to get to work.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:50.540
Lie down.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:51.660
You still have an IV coming.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.420
- Everything else can wait.
- It's fine, really.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.740
My mom was still chopping
pork ribs in the kitchen

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.140
right before she gave
birth to my brother.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.980
I'm not trying to scare you,

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.820
but I've had patients miscarry just
from reaching up to hang clothes.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.820
I've had people bleed heavily
after fighting with their husbands.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:01.650
Even heart failure...

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:03.820
So lie down.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:07.450
Bringing a life

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.860
into the world is not an easy thing.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.950
Your number one job right
now is to take care of yourself.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.820
Lie down.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.380
Be good.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.220
Mingzhu,

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.900
be good.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.860
Honey.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.020
Are you thirsty?

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.340
No.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:26.380
No?

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:27.540
That won't do.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.900
The doctor said pregnant women
had to stay hydrated.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:31.380
It's warm.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.420
I'm really fine.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.980
Be good.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.860
Here, have a shrimp.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.310
I don't feel like eating it.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.060
Be good.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.580
The doctor said shrimps were good
to pregnant women.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:44.100
Come on.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:45.380

So good.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.180
I have to share this on my Moments.

You're sharing this?

Chen, do you remember?

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.300
This is where we had

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:59.700
our very first date.

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:04.440
Ever since that day,

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.140
I've imagined it over and over,

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.860
the two of us getting
married someday,

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:11.900
having a kid,

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:14.420
and how happy we'd be.

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.340
But when I actually found
out you were really pregnant,

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.020
my feelings were complicated.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.660
I was thrilled, excited,
over the moon, of course.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.020
But I was also nervous and scared.

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.820
I mean, half the time I
still feel like a kid myself.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.180
I can't cook,

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.540
my parents still help me
with my laundry.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.220
I honestly don't know

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.420
if I can be a good dad.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.740
But this is our baby.

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:01.740
And I want to welcome

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.740
this new life with you.

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:10.020
And listen,

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.220
you don't need to
worry about how I feel,

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.180
or what anyone else says.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.620
I want to hear what you really think.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.700
From the moment I knew I was pregnant,

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.580
I never once hesitated about this.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.020
Do you know why?

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.140
Because I never imagined
my life without you.

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.820
I know my mom is right.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.340
We're not married yet,

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.620
and we're still kids ourselves.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:57.980
We're not fully mature.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.660
But who doesn't grow up
through exactly this stage?

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:14.580
Xu Zhidong.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.900
I'm here.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.060
I never planned out what our future

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.220
had to look like.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.140
Because as long as you're in it,

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:29.950
that's enough for me.

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:45.460
Chen,

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:48.300
will you marry me?

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:58.900
Of course.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.900
- This thing is impossible to slip on.
- What are you doing?

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.900
I think we have to grease it
and wear gloves.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.450
I don't want you to change
your mind, so I'll just force it on.

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:17.460
- Is it really that hard to put on?
- So hard.

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:21.340
It's too big.

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:25.100
This won't do.

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:26.940
Let me make you a new one.

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:29.580
No. I want this one.

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:31.260
No.

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:32.260
Chen.

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.380
This is supposed to
symbolize eternal love

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:35.780
and a promise you can't take back.

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:36.900
It's meant

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.140
to fit snug.

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:39.980
- Like for life.
- I want this one.

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:40.900
No, it's too big.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:41.860
It won't stay on you.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:49.500
This is fake.

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:52.340
It's not worth repairing.

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:53.620
Why bother fixing it?

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:54.980
No, no,

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:56.500
that can't be right.

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:58.700
This belongs to my daughter's
mother-in-law's family.

00:07:58.700 --> 00:07:59.940
It's their heirloom.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.660
Supposedly passed down for generations.

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.340
I've been appraising jade my whole life.

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:05.540
You think I'd get it wrong?

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:07.820
The craftsmanship is decent, though.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:09.340
The person who faked it

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:11.060
must have been a real pro.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.140
This one has really good quality.

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:16.020
Is it for your child's wedding?

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:17.060
Yes.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:18.180
It's 100,000 yuan.

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:19.660
Yes.

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:24.260
It's yours.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:28.620
Let me get this straight.

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:31.940
You spent that 100,000 yuan

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:35.020
to buy Mingzhu a new bracelet?

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:42.300
I didn't want them make things
difficult for Mingzhu.

00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:45.420
Why didn't you tell me?

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:50.700
What's the point?

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:55.340
It would just make
one more person worry.

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:58.860
Oh, Xiang,

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:03.420
I'm your husband.

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:05.780
Everything that happens in this family

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:11.460
is something we
should shoulder together,

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.100
and something we
should figure out together.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:23.940
Wait here.

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:40.980
Take it.

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:43.780
(People's Republic of China,
Real Property Title Certificate)

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:51.700
I see.

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:54.260
We'll transfer the house to Zhidong

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:56.980
and add Bichen's name to the deed.

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:57.580
Yes.

00:09:58.820 --> 00:09:59.300
Alright.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.020
And we have to pay back the money

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:03.420
we took from Zhixia.

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:04.460
Yes, we will.

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:05.940
We'll use your pension

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.380
and pay it back month by month.

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:09.980
No matter how long it takes,

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:11.340
we'll pay it off.

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:13.220
Yes, we will.

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:15.140
As parents,

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:18.580
we can't keep adding
to the kids' burdens,

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:20.300
especially Zhixia.

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:21.580
Yes, I know.

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:24.020
We can move back to your hometown

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:26.740
and stay in the old house for now.

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:28.140
We'll make do.

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:31.500
Back to the old house.

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:37.940
That could actually work.

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:42.900
It's nice and quiet out there.

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:45.020
It's a good place.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:47.740
I grew up in that old house.

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:49.820
I haven't been back in so long.

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:50.900
I...

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.780
I'd actually really like to go back.

00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:57.660
Xu Dacheng,

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:05.140
I'm sorry for putting you through this.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:09.780
So basically,

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:12.020
you asked your boss for two hours off,

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:13.340
and he approved two days?

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:15.940
See? My boss is solid.

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:18.940
Your hotel is probably two steps

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:20.460
from shutting down.

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:22.610
I'm thinking twice before
working with you guys again.

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:24.820
Don't jinx it!

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:25.700
I'm telling you,

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.980
Nanxi Hotel will stand forever.

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:30.460
But Mingzhu,

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:32.420
I don't know if I should say this.

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:33.820
I know what you're going to say.

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:36.260
You can't expect every woman

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.340
to want to be a mother
just because I'm pregnant.

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:41.660
No, you don't understand the situation.

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:43.260
Bichen wants

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:45.020
to keep the baby herself.

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.140
Her mom was just furious
and was forcing her to get an abortion.

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.100
Even so, that's not
your place to interfere.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:51.900
I didn't want to get involved either.

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:53.500
But what could I do?

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:54.700
I was just pulled into it.

00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:58.660
Blood ties are strange,

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:00.860
like something you can't outrun.

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:02.420
I'm pretty.

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:05.660
I don't have time to debate the origin
of life with you today.

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:07.380
I have to bring lunch to Mr. Hu.

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:08.820
Again?

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.760
Who do you think I'm trying
to win over Mr Hu for, huh?

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:13.620
It's for our future kid.

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:15.860
So we won't have to worry
about tutoring later.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.100
Love hides in unexpected places.

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:19.260
Bye.

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.500
You just want me to watch the shop.

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:23.040
If you want to clean up, go ahead.

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:27.540
(Teacher's Office)

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:28.180
This problem

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:30.020
also deals with
instantaneous acceleration.

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:32.020
The method for solving it
is the same as the last one,

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:33.100
which I've explained to you.

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:35.020
So, you can work on this one yourself.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:36.820
Go on.

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:47.780
Hello.

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:49.740
Yes.

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:51.220
Our physics department

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:52.860
prepared the monthly exam.

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:54.810
The digital version?

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:56.100
We have it.

00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:58.020
Okay.

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:00.220
I'll send it to you now.

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:04.100
Okay.

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:20.780
Yes, you're using the right method.

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:24.460
I'm going to the restroom.

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:25.240
Finish it yourself.

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:36.340
(Senior Year Physics Monthly Exam Paper)

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:48.820
So? Have you solved it?

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:50.500
I haven't, Mr. Hu.

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:52.420
Look here.

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:55.380
Mr. Hu,

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:56.900
you must be hungry.

00:13:59.220 --> 00:13:59.860
Hi, Ni.

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:04.420
You brought me lunch again.

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:05.380
Thank you.

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:05.980
You're welcome.

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:09.460
Please come in.

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:11.660
Shen Minghui,

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:13.220
go sit on Mr. Sun's desk.

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:13.820
Go on.

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:16.420
You're so focused.

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:17.520
Move.

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:26.020
You aren't busy today?

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:28.620
Thank you for bringing me lunch.

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:29.220
It's nothing.

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:42.060
Mom.

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:44.420
What?

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:45.300
What are you doing?

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:46.700
Why are you taking my things?

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:47.860
What kind of son gets married

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:49.580
and leaves his parents homeless?

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.680
Zhidong, don't throw around words
you barely understand.

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:55.420
"Homeless"?

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:56.580
Please. Let me tell you,

00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:57.980
over by the old house,

00:14:57.980 --> 00:14:59.740
the air is fresh,
the environment's great.

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:01.820
It's practically a natural
mountain-view villa.

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:03.380
Once your dad and I move there,

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:06.300
I'll plant flowers, he'll go fishing,
life will be wonderful.

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:07.140
Wonderful?

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:08.860
What mountain-view villa?

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:10.740
Grandma's old place
barely gets any sunlight.

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:11.700
It's dark and damp.

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:13.660
If you two move in there,
your knees can't bear it.

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:14.780
Nonsense.

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:16.780
Have you forgotten what your dad
and I used to do?

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:18.140
We know how to fix things.

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:18.780
Right?

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:20.940
Turn it into a real mountain-view villa.

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:23.940
No more discussion.
I make the final call in this family.

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:24.420
Yes.

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:25.300
It's settled.

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:27.620
You focus on getting married

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:28.980
and taking care of your wife.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.620
I'm waiting to become a grandpa.

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:31.660
That's right.

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:32.860
No way. You're not leaving.

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:33.660
Listen to me.

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:34.780
Listen,

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:36.620
as soon as my first grandson is born,

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:38.780
you'll need more space.

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:39.900
Zhidong,

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:41.460
this house is already

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:44.260
in yours and Bichen's names.

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:47.780
You three have
to build a good life here.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:48.980
Be good.

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:50.420
I don't need it.

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:51.860
Listen to me.

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:53.360
- No, listen to me.
- Just stay here.

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:55.540
I know you and Dad are
doing this for me and Chen.

00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:56.780
But the bride price

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:57.980
already put you

00:15:57.980 --> 00:15:59.540
through enough.

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:00.660
As for the wedding house,

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:02.660
I don't want to trouble you anymore.

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:04.300
Please understand where I'm coming from.

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:07.500
Zhidong,

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:09.380
you've grown up.

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:11.140
You're thoughtful now.

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:12.060
Come on.

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:13.580
My son is reliable, isn't he?

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:14.220
Yes, he is.

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:16.340
You two just stay here, comfortably.

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:18.580
As for the house,
we'll figure it out together.

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:19.340
Okay?

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:22.460
Okay.

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:23.780
Let's do this.

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:26.180
Let's listen to Zhidong.

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:26.820
We're staying.

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:27.660
Alright.

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:28.980
Carry these bags

00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:30.700
back to our room.

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:31.180
Yes, yes.

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:32.500
- We'll unload the cart.
- Alright.

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:33.180
It's settled then.

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:34.770
- Yes, we're unloading the cart.
- It's settled.

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:35.500
Alright now.

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:37.620
- Come unload the cart.
- I have to move the stuff back.

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:38.900
I'll come help you later.

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:40.100
Easy there.

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:40.700
Unbelievable.

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:43.620
Now we have to move
all this stuff back in.

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:45.100
Now!

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:54.780
What are you doing?

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:55.700
We're not opening it.

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:56.620
We're leaving.

00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:00.260
The spare key is in its usual spot.

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:01.060
It's upstairs.

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:01.980
We're leaving.

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:02.900
Come on!

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:04.140
Take good care of Bichen!

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:05.780
How could you go back on your word?

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:07.060
Bye, Zhidong!

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:09.460
Is this really the role model
you want to set for me?

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:26.760
How are you doing over there, Dacheng?

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:28.940
Dacheng?

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:30.020
Coming!

00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:32.540
Are you almost done?

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:40.300
I'm carrying everything in at once.

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:41.220
So heavy.

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:44.140
Let me tell you,

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:46.540
we really

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:49.140
owed this to Mingzhu.

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:51.500
She did a huge thing for this family.

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:54.900
Well, she is our own flesh and blood.

00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:57.020
When it mattered,

00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:58.900
she stepped up without hesitation.

00:17:58.900 --> 00:17:59.740
That's right.

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:04.900
My heart just breaks

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:06.300
for that girl.

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:10.420
So young, and already a widow,

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:12.540
carrying a child all on her own.

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:15.500
Just thinking about it makes me so sad,

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:16.260
you know.

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:18.460
Xiang,

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:21.300
none of this is easy.

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:23.550
And honestly, a lot of it is my fault.

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:25.500
Really, it all comes back to me.

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:30.700
Alright, alright, enough.

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:32.700
Look at you,

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:35.020
admitting you're wrong

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:37.500
is like pulling teeth.

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:38.900
Okay, it's fine now.

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:42.060
I'll take care of all this.

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:43.540
Don't lift a finger, just rest.

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:45.520
I don't want you having
another hemorrhage.

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:49.540
Xu Dacheng,

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:51.540
You've lived

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:53.140
most of your life,

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:54.110
but you still have a way

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:56.180
of saying the right thing
in the worst possible way.

00:18:58.060 --> 00:18:59.260
Fine, I'll shut up.

00:18:59.260 --> 00:18:59.940
I'll shut up.

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:02.540
Anyway,

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:04.900
once we get these curtains up,

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:06.300
the place is basically done.

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:07.140
We can move in.

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:09.060
I'll get up on the roof

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:10.940
and check if there are any leaks.

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:13.500
I swear to god,

00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:15.380
Chen and I never said

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:17.060
we didn't want to live with Mom and Dad.

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:21.780
Then it's probably Mom
feeling guilty toward Bichen

00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:25.700
and trying to make up for it.

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:27.540
What's there to feel guilty about?

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:29.780
What's really strange is Dad.

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:31.900
You know how stubborn he usually is,

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:33.780
but this time he just
went along with Mom

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:35.020
and moved out with her.

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:40.740
That is a little strange.

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:45.220
So what do we do?

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:09.180
These ingredients are so cheap.

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:11.180
And they're fresh.

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:12.700
Why is the door unlocked?

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:14.260
What's going on?

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:19.460
What are you doing here?

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:20.020
Yes.

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:21.980
What's going on?

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:23.500
Did you catch a cold?

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:26.810
It's because of the change
of the season.

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:29.580
Chen is at work. She doesn't have time
to take care of me.

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:31.220
So I can only come here.

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:32.580
But...

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:45.380
Just drop the act already.

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:50.620
Why are you doing this?

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:56.060
What kind of son gets married
and makes his parents move out?

00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:57.620
I can't live with that shame.

00:20:57.860 --> 00:20:59.420
Just move back home, okay?

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:01.140
Chen and I will live here instead.

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:02.140
No way.

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:03.100
This house is...

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:05.300
How are you supposed to live here?

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:07.100
Besides, your commute would be too far.

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:08.460
I can handle it.

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:10.540
Look at this little courtyard.

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:12.220
If we plant flowers, it's a garden,

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:13.580
plant fruit and it's an orchard.

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:14.780
Chen would love it.

00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:16.100
Enough with the nonsense.

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:17.940
Get up and get out of here.

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:18.820
Yes, out.

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:22.380
I don't have the energy to get out.

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:25.460
I'm sick and I need you
to take care of me.

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:48.020
(Senior Physics Monthly Exam)

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:53.180
Well, well, Mr. Hu Gang.

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:54.980
Your class did quite well, huh?

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:55.740
Mr. Hu Gang,

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:56.820
oh, Mr. Hu Gang..

00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:59.540
So, when you said you'd
shoulder the heavy burden,

00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:01.440
you meant you'd reveal
the answers, is that it?

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:03.340
And self-imposed pressure

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:04.820
meant getting a perfect score?

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:07.260
Your class average is a 98, correct?

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:10.380
It's all my fault.

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:13.020
How were the answers leaked?

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:15.540
Mr. Hu, you can't just accuse
an innocent person.

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:19.420
This test was hard,

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:22.020
and my class averaged 98.

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:23.940
And you scored 99.

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:25.250
Do you even believe that yourself?

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:26.140
I do.

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:29.820
Before the exam,

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:31.660
you were the only one
who came into my office.

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:32.780
Did you steal the test paper?

00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:33.500
I didn't.

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:36.540
Still lying, huh?

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:37.660
If you don't admit it,

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:39.100
I'll go to the school

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:40.620
and pull the surveillance footage.

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:41.300
Surveillance?

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:45.140
Where?

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:47.860
Of course our office has surveillance.

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:54.140
What's so funny?

00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:57.220
What are you doing?

00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:57.980
Mr. Hu,

00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:01.740
if the office really had surveillance,

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:05.700
you wouldn't have... "Oh, Ni..."

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:06.540
Shen Minghui!

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:08.180
No camera? Even better!

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:11.620
You little punk,
what nonsense were you just spouting?

00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:12.140
Ni,

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:13.140
please stop!

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:14.290
- Say that again!
- Please stop!

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:15.980
It really wasn't me! Please stop!

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:17.450
- You've got some nerve!
- Ni!

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:18.540
Ni!

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:20.100
A beating is the least you deserve.

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:21.360
I'm telling your dad about this.

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:22.460
Don't tell my dad.

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:23.580
He's already busy enough.

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:24.980
Was it you?

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:26.140
It wasn't me.

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:27.260
Still won't tell the truth?

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:29.060
- Tell the truth!
- Fine, fine!

00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:29.660
I'll say it.

00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:34.820
It was me.

00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:38.380
And?

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:42.180
Mr. Hu, I'm sorry.

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:43.420
Is that all?

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:48.020
I'll go to Mr. Pan right
away and confess.

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:50.900
Mr. Hu was kind
enough to tutor me,

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:52.950
and I repaid him by
stabbing him in the back

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:53.900
and pulling this stunt.

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:55.610
Why are you still standing here then?

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:11.220
Ni,

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:13.380
you're amazing.

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:14.900
Mr. Hu,

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:16.980
I think you ought to get to know me

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:18.460
on a deeper, more comprehensive level.

00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:20.060
Don't you agree?

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:24.740
Yes, you're right.

00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:29.540
You should've been there today.

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:32.100
You would've seen me
tear your brother apart. I was epic.

00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:35.690
Hey, even if you're beating a dog,
you should consider its owner.

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:37.740
My poor brother has
been through enough lately.

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:39.770
If you keep hitting him,
he'll never get into college.

00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:41.180
Come on, I didn't actually go all out.

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:42.620
I was just scaring him.

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:43.680
And like you said,

00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:44.900
if he was going to get into college,
he would have by now.

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:46.550
Whether I hit him or
not isn't the problem.

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:48.100
What happens next?

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:53.460
And then, Mr. Hu finally saw it clearly.

00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:55.460
I'm me.

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:57.140
I'm nothing like Feng Meiqi.

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:00.980
Go buy me a coffee.

00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:03.060
Are you serious? I'm pregnant!

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:04.420
That food is too dry.

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:05.900
Besides, after everything I just did

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:07.020
for your Minghui,

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:09.220
don't you think you owe me one?

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:16.940
You...

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:19.740
So,

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:21.740
Zhixia,

00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:25.380
you dad and I thought

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:29.740
you need to get your brother
to come home immediately.

00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:30.580
Yes,

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:33.140
drag him back if you have to.

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:36.020
Bichen's pregnant.

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:39.020
The wedding can't be delayed anymore.

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:41.660
This is not the time for a standoff.

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:42.620
Yes.

00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:43.660
I can't do that.

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:45.820
Not unless you tell me

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:48.300
where that 100,000 yuan went.

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:50.500
What did you actually spend it on?

00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:54.740
That 100,000 yuan, I...

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:55.950
If you don't tell me, I'm leaving.

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:57.500
I...

00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:00.620
That 100,000 yuan...

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:01.580
I...

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:03.020
I bought

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:06.540
Mingzhu a jade bracelet with it.

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:08.260
Yes.

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:10.460
Your mom bought Mingzhu a jade bracelet.

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:12.380
What?

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:13.060
Yes.

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:14.020
You bought a bracelet?

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:19.420
Yes.

00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:26.460
This...

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:29.260
Isn't this?

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:29.940
It's fake.

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:33.260
It can't be.

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:35.700
That's the heirloom
from Mingzhu's in-laws.

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:36.540
Yes, it's fake.

00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:38.860
I asked several master
craftsmen to look at it.

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:40.100
They all said the same thing.

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:42.820
So maybe...

00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:43.420
Maybe it was

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.300
swapped out sometime
while it was being passed down

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:49.340
through the generations.

00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:51.100
Stop making excuses for them.

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:53.380
They totally duped her.

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:55.260
Let's not make assumptions.

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:56.340
How is that an assumption?

00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:57.180
Even her marriage...

00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:59.700
No wonder it repaired so perfectly.

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:02.540
Turns out we had

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:04.900
a real-life Good Samaritan.

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:07.100
Yes, she's Good Samaritan.

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:11.620
- Why are you laughing?
- I'm a Good Samaritan!

00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:13.100
Stop laughing.

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:14.700
She's calling me a Good Samaritan.

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:17.660
Anyway,

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:19.700
when your sister came
to the hospital to see me

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:21.900
and I saw that bracelet on her wrist,

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:23.980
I felt relieved.

00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:24.540
Yes.

00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:27.540
I think what your mother
did was very noble.

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:31.220
Dad, so that's why you were
so willing to move out

00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:32.380
to the countryside with Mom.

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:39.420
Mom,

00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:42.060
I get that

00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:43.860
you love Mingzhu.

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:48.020
But I can't accept this
"rob Peter to pay Paul" approach.

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:50.220
How could you think it's okay

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:52.980
to finance your love for one daughter

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:54.420
with someone else's bride price?

00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:56.380
That's foolish.

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:04.620
Have some food.

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:06.820
Don't just drink.

00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:09.260
The food is really fresh today.

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:10.060
Right?

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:14.060
You can try harder.

00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:16.860
Why did you lock yourselves in?

00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:23.300
It's called claiming the territory.
Get it?

00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:24.780
It's called guarding against thieves.

00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:26.580
Who came up with this idea?

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:30.340
I haven't eaten yet.

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:31.780
Can you at least let me grab a bite?

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:32.940
Go home

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:34.820
and make your own food.

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:37.380
Oh, right,

00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:41.140
in that basket,
there are three bags of eggs.

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:42.860
One for Bichen,

00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:43.780
one for Zhixia,

00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:44.980
and one for Mingzhu.

00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:47.700
I bought them from
free-range hens in the village,

00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:48.780
really nutritious.

00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:50.500
So I'm just the egg delivery man now?

00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:52.700
You don't want to?

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:00.020
That's not playing fair.

00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:02.220
It's called using whatever tactics work.

00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:17.700
(Xin City Grand Court)

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:18.380
Zhixia.

00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:20.900
Mingzhu,

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:23.100
these are free-range eggs
from Madam Yu.

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:23.940
They're really fresh.

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:25.900
She's giving me stuff again?
You should keep them.

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:26.780
You, me, and Bichen,

00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:28.340
all three pregnant women get a share.

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:28.900
Take it.

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:33.060
Then thank your mom for me.

00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:35.460
We're family, no need for that.

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:37.060
How's your mom recovering?

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:37.860
Pretty well.

00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:38.900
That's good.

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:40.100
Mingzhu,

00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:42.060
you already had a high status
in our family.

00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:43.580
But after you talked Bichen down,

00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:45.340
your value skyrocketed.

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:47.290
My parents are practically
ready to worship you.

00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:48.180
That's not necessary.

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:50.580
And Bichen and Zhidong...

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:51.300
They've made up.

00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:52.060
Don't worry.

00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:52.820
That's good.

00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:55.980
Your neighborhood here is really nice.

00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:57.700
I just walked around.

00:29:57.700 --> 00:29:59.180
It's huge.

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:00.260
Kids can play

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:01.460
without worrying about cars.

00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:05.220
(Duplex flat - 3,000,000 yuan)
Though the price...

00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:07.540
My father-in-law bought
this when it first opened.

00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:08.860
It wasn't so expensive back then.

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:11.100
Your father-in-law had great foresight.

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:13.220
This place is really good.

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:15.380
Come in and sit for a while.

00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:16.660
No, it's fine.

00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:17.620
I'd be intruding.

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:18.380
It's fine.

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:20.380
- You should go back inside.
- I should get going too.

00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:21.780
(Unit for sale)
Alright, drive safe.

00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:22.580
Okay, bye.

00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:23.140
Okay.

00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:29.820
(Xin City Grand Court)

00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:32.060
- Mom.
- I'm back.

00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:33.820
I brought some free-range eggs home.

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:34.820
Where should I put them?

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:36.900
We have enough eggs at home.

00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:38.340
Why did you buy more?

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:39.460
Someone gave them to me.

00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:40.260
Who gave them?

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:43.660
My birth mother.

00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:45.700
Shen Mingzhu!

00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:47.020
You startled me.

00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:47.860
What's going on?

00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:48.460
Listen,

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:50.140
Shen Mingzhu,

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:52.270
you need to stay away from people

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:53.940
who would give away
their flesh and blood.

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:55.300
I've told you that, haven't I?

00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:57.820
Today they give you a bag of eggs,

00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:00.340
tomorrow they'll ask you to
return them with a chicken.

00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:02.900
Can you keep your voice down?

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:04.020
I'm working.

00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:05.060
You...

00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:06.220
Mingzhu's young.

00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:08.220
She doesn't understand
how the world works.

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:09.380
We'll talk later.

00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:10.780
Think about it,

00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:13.060
Mingzhu lived with the
Shen family for thirty years

00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:14.180
and they never came looking.

00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:16.500
Now she marries into our family

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:17.660
and suddenly they show up?

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:18.700
Why?

00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:20.180
Obviously they want something.

00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:21.500
I hate hearing you talk like that!

00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:24.660
What could they possibly want?

00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:26.420
What are we,

00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:28.980
some powerful aristocratic family?

00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:30.940
We're just ordinary people.

00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:32.450
What exactly are you showing off about?

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:35.060
You bragged so much you lost our son.

00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:38.420
Where are you going?

00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:49.420
Don't mind him.

00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:53.300
He's taking it out on me.

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:54.660
Well,

00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:56.380
the factory's rushing orders these days.

00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:57.660
He probably went back to work.

00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:59.500
There's a bed and
blankets in his office.

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:01.020
He won't let himself suffer.

00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:01.860
It's fine.

00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:05.660
I'll take the eggs with me then.

00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:06.660
Leave them here.

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:08.640
I'll get Mrs. Mao to
put them away later.

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:18.940
I'm telling you,

00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:20.700
stay away from that family from now on.

00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:27.740
Everyone's so difficult.

00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:29.220
Taking their temper out on me.

00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:31.660
Contentment.

00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:33.780
Contentment.

00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:35.460
Write it.

00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:36.020
Okay.

00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:37.220
- What is it?
- Look at this.

00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:39.600
Just look at this place. Isn't it nice?

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:42.540
I was dropping off
eggs at Mingzhu's today.

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:43.980
This is her marital home.

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:45.460
Look at the pavilions and courtyards,

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:46.260
it's like a park.

00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:46.940
(Selling, Zhu's unit)
Yes.

00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:48.700
(On sales)
It must be so comfortable living here.

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:49.340
It's nice.

00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:50.540
The price is nice too.

00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:53.060
I did the math just now.

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:55.460
Even if I sell our place

00:32:55.650 --> 00:32:57.060
and switch to a three-bedroom here,

00:32:57.060 --> 00:32:58.840
we'd still need to add a few
hundred thousand on top.

00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:00.020
Totally out of reach.

00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:01.300
Changing houses is a huge undertaking.

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:02.460
Let's wait a little longer.

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:03.340
Wait?

00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:05.820
Until when?

00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:08.260
Until Jiao grows up
and provides us back?

00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:09.540
Don't forget.

00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:11.740
When Xu Zhidong gets married,

00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:14.340
the ones moving back to the
countryside were my parents.

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:15.700
The countryside's not bad.

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:17.940
Clean air, plenty of space.

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:22.460
Why is getting promoted
to department head

00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:24.780
at your company harder
than running for president?

00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:26.450
It's coming. The bosses
are evaluating us now.

00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:28.980
Then work harder.

00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:31.180
If we can't upgrade our house,

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:33.980
at least you could
upgrade your career, right?

00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:40.540
Listen,

00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:43.100
chances are slim.

00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:46.820
Wu pulled some strings.

00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:50.540
How do you know it's hopeless?

00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:52.940
If he can pull strings,

00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:54.700
so can we.

00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:58.460
Is it that hard to find connections?

00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:07.660
Mingzhu's father-in-law
seems pretty well connected.

00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:08.980
I could ask her.

00:34:09.150 --> 00:34:10.420
I don't think that's a good idea.

00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:12.540
What would her in-laws think?

00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:14.760
You just reconnected with her
and you're already asking for favors?

00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:16.420
That's true.

00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:19.340
Just imagine if we could
live in a place like this.

00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:20.940
Wouldn't that be great?

00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:22.820
(Xin City Grand Court)
Wouldn't that make you happy?

00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:24.460
Aiming too high.

00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:26.780
Wishful thinking.

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:30.060
Harmony at home is what really matters.

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:31.540
Next page.

00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:32.740
Well, write it down.

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:33.980
What...

00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:35.260
What was that for?

00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:41.380
Go on.

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:44.260
Flip it over.

00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:46.180
Once it softens, it's ready to eat.

00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:47.940
Okay, it's almost done.

00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:49.020
Not soft yet.

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:49.980
Keep roasting.

00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:55.940
I miss my mom.

00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:05.740
I remember

00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:07.700
when you were in prison,

00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:12.300
my mom had to take
care of the two kids for us.

00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:15.140
There wasn't much to eat,

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:17.020
so she'd coax them

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:18.820
with roasted sweet potatoes.

00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:28.140
Thank goodness for my mom.

00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:31.940
She helped us raise those two kids.

00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:38.900
I still remember her
muttering back then,

00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:39.580
saying,

00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:43.220
"Good thing there are only two.

00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:44.980
Thank God.

00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:47.620
If there were three,

00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:50.940
I probably couldn't handle it."

00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:54.980
Looking back now,

00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:58.020
she must've felt guilty.

00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:00.980
She was comforting herself.

00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:03.980
The old lady had it hard too.

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:09.180
Helping us raise two little ones...

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:16.660
Xiang,

00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:21.180
life with me has made you suffer.

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:25.220
No.

00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:26.780
Don't say that.

00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:30.900
Alright, alright, enough.

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:32.420
You know,

00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:34.460
when I was little,

00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:38.100
my mom took me to see
that blind fortune-teller, Zhao.

00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:39.180
He said my fate was just

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:40.540
to have a hard life.

00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:42.260
It wouldn't have mattered who I married.

00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:44.940
But I married you.

00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:47.940
What does that blind Zhao know?

00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:49.780
He's been dead for years!

00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:51.420
He was talking nonsense!

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:53.900
Xiang,

00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:56.780
I promise you,

00:36:57.540 --> 00:36:58.700
from now on,

00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:00.900
I'm going to make your life

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:03.260
sweet.

00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:10.260
You scared me!

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:11.580
What are you doing here?

00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:13.900
Yes, why are you here?

00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:15.580
Stay home and take care of Bichen.

00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:17.580
It wasn't just me today.

00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:20.020
Mr. and Mrs. Xu.

00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:21.700
Bichen!

00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:22.740
You're here.

00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:26.100
Bichen, I'm so sorry.

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:28.540
I can't open the door for you either,

00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:30.420
because this is a matter of principle.

00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:30.980
Yes.

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:32.700
Zhidong,

00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:34.700
take Bichen home.

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:35.500
Go home.

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:38.500
I wonder what this is.

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:39.700
It's still fresh and warm.

00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:43.620
It's so pretty.

00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:45.580
Let me see it.

00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:46.540
Give it to me.

00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:47.580
Come out to see it.

00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:49.380
Dacheng, open the door now.

00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:50.060
I got it.

00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:50.660
Hurry!

00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:52.640
I have to check out
their marriage certificates.

00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:54.260
Just give us a minute.

00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:54.980
- You...
- Give us a minute.

00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:56.260
Are you playing me?

00:37:57.940 --> 00:37:58.580
I got it.

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:01.100
It was so easy to lock it.

00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:02.540
Why is it so hard to open it?

00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:04.500
Give it to me.

00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:05.540
I want to see it.

00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:06.580
Come on.

00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:07.380
Let me see.

00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:09.060
They registered their marriage.

00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:10.260
(Yuan Bichen, Xu Zhidong)
I have to see it.

00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:10.740
Yes.

00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:12.620
What a perfect match.

00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:13.900
Yes, yes.

00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:14.580
How nice.

00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:17.700
You...

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:22.180
My uncle and second aunt called me.

00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:23.380
They said this old house

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:24.780
was left by Grandma
to all of you siblings.

00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:26.420
It's a shared property.

00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:28.260
If you keep living here,

00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:29.780
won't that cause problems?

00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:31.740
That's a fair point.

00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:33.380
But why

00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:35.180
didn't they call me?

00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:35.900
Well...

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:37.660
Mr. and Mrs. Xu,

00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:39.940
Zhixia already told me

00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:41.500
about the 100,000 yuan.

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:50.180
Bichen,

00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:56.420
I handled that so poorly.

00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:57.780
I'm really sorry.

00:38:57.780 --> 00:38:59.460
Mrs. Xu, please don't say that.

00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:01.060
We're all one family.

00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:03.340
And I'm going to be a mom myself.

00:39:03.450 --> 00:39:04.780
I understand where your heart was.

00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:06.380
Good girl.

00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:07.540
Mr. and Mrs. Xu,

00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:09.940
please don't worry about
the money anymore.

00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:11.780
Zhidong has been
giving me his paychecks.

00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:13.060
I've saved them for him.

00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:14.780
We have at least 70,000 or 80,000.

00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:17.420
You rascal!

00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:18.980
You little brat!

00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:22.940
My parents also said
as long as Zhidong and I are happy,

00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:24.460
the bride price doesn't matter.

00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:25.620
It's just a symbolic gesture.

00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:28.060
Your parents

00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:29.140
are so kind.

00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:30.740
- Yes, so kind.
- Yes.

00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:32.300
And there's something important

00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:33.260
I want to tell you.

00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:35.260
Go on.

00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:38.700
Please come live with us.

00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:42.940
Well...

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:45.180
Once I'm married

00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:46.620
and the baby arrives,

00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:48.660
Zhidong and I still have to work.

00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:51.500
Who's going to take care of the baby?

00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:53.620
We'll need Grandpa
and Grandma, won't we?

00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:56.300
Yes, yes! We'll take care of the baby.

00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:57.220
We'll handle everything.

00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:57.780
I'm grandpa.

00:39:57.780 --> 00:39:59.140
- Grandpa.
- And I'm Grandma.

00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:00.020
Grandma.

00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:07.700
What do you feel like eating?

00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:08.900
I'll make it for you.

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:10.660
Sweet and sour ribs.

00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:11.780
Sweet and sour ribs!

00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:12.780
Alright!

00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:15.220
That's my specialty!

00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:18.620
Tong!

00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:19.500
You're back!

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:20.220
Jingxiang, you're back.

00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:21.580
This is my daughter-in-law.

00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:23.820
Come, Bichen.

00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:25.580
This is Madam Liu.

00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:27.610
- This is Madam Zhang.
- Hi, Madam Liu.

00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:28.620
Hi, Madam Zhang.

00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:30.620
You're so blessed.

00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:32.980
Your daughter-in-law
is just like your daughter.

00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:34.260
That's right!

00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:36.540
We're going to enjoy a happy life.

00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:37.900
- Yes.
- Alright now.

00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:39.140
Alright.

00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:40.780
Our daughter-in-law is expecting.

00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:42.460
A double blessing!

00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:44.060
Triple!

00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:45.980
Our eldest daughter is
pregnant with her second.

00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:47.540
What triple?

00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:48.460
It's quadruple!

00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:50.180
Our youngest is pregnant too.

00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:51.580
Quadruple blessings!

00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:52.460
Quadruple!

00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:53.980
Four blessings all at once!

00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:56.580
Our youngest daughter is also expecting.

00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:57.900
Congratulations!

00:40:57.900 --> 00:40:59.620
Our blessings all at once!

00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:01.140
Thank you. This is our daughter-in-law.

00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:01.740
Our daughter-in-law.

00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:02.500
She's so pretty.

00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:03.500
Thank you.

00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:04.660
You're so blessed.

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:05.300
Hello.

00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:06.780
What a happy family.

00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:09.140
Okay, give me a minute.

00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:10.100
I'm coming.

00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:11.460
Okay.

00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:12.740
Dad.

00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:14.060
Dad, uh...

00:41:15.310 --> 00:41:16.540
The furniture delivery is here.

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:17.380
I'll go meet them.

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:18.580
Just leave it here.

00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:19.540
Bichen, stay here.

00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:20.860
Don't go anywhere.

00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:22.260
Just stay here.

00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:23.100
I'm coming.

00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:25.260
- Dacheng, I'm coming.
- Leave it. I'll come get it later.

00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:26.700
Let me take that. Come.

00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:27.220
I'll get it.

00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:29.020
Mrs. Xu, let me give you a hand.

00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:30.420
- Please stay there.
- No, no.

00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:31.420
- Stay there.
- No, no.

00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:32.660
Don't touch it.

00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:34.260
Easy there.

00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:35.020
Leave it.

00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:35.980
Easy there.

00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:37.060
Easy.

00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:38.300
- Easy.
- Careful.

00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:39.060
Let's go home.

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:41.060
- We're home.
- Be careful.

00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:43.140
We're home!

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:44.180
Yes!

00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:49.380
Getting mad at Shen Minghui
isn't worth it.

00:41:49.390 --> 00:41:51.430
He's been a heartbreaking little
troublemaker since he was a kid.

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:53.500
Once he wanted to test if hair
straighteners could really curl hair,

00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:54.980
he almost made his dad go bald.

00:41:57.340 --> 00:41:58.020
Here, Mr. Hu.

00:41:58.020 --> 00:41:58.780
Have some ribs.

00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:00.300
Thank you.

00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:02.700
Mr. Hu.

00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:08.100
Uh...

00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:10.780
Go sit at Ms. Sun's desk for now.

00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:15.500
Shen Minghui,

00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:16.900
are you pretending you don't see me?

00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:22.420
Hello, Ni.

00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:25.980
Shen Minghui, I'm warning you.

00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:27.580
If you give Mr. Hu any more trouble,

00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:28.660
I'll tell your sister.

00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:29.810
And she's pregnant, remember?

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:30.700
Ni,

00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:32.420
whose side are you on?

00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:34.940
What is Mr. Hu to you?

00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:38.860
He's my life coach.

00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:41.980
My entire life plan is his to design.
