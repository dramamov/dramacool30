WEBVTT

00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:01.540
Mom?

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:04.130
I got a package addressed to you.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:05.290
Who sent it?

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:06.540
It's from your father.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.630
Please give me some advice.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.250
Trust me.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.130
That was great.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:15.880
It's Kuroki-san.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.630
What time should we meet tomorrow?

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:18.790
Eight o'clock?

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.580
Isn't that a little early?

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.540
Asami-san.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.210
I'm heading out to practice with Kuroki-san.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.040
Oh...

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.460
Kuroki again, huh?

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.130
It was a letter from my father.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.580
Asami.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.540
I trust you're doing well.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.670
As an actor,

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.290
you seem to be quite successful.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.540
The novel I wrote...

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.540
I wonder if you've received it.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.710
Although it's a work of fiction,

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.290
half of it is based on my own experiences.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.710
You could call it my autobiography.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.170
A production company in the UK

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.630
has decided to adapt it into a film.

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.880
They seem to be the best team to entrust my work to.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.130
If you, Asami, could play the lead role,

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.580
I would be very happy.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.080
Me... to play that father of mine?

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.880
"At 25:00, in Akasaka" Season 2
(Episode 8)

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.000
That's him.

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.920
Hello, are you from the inn?

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.250
No.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.960
I'm the head of this village. My name is Goto.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.080
- Hello, Village Head. I'm Fukuyama.
- I see.

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.330
Fukuyama-san, are you here on vacation?

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:20.540
No, I'm here to see a friend.

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:22.500
Oh?

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.080
- So you're Muroga's friend.
- That's right. "Muroga's" friend.

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:29.880
Your real name...

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:35.580
It's a nice name.

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.250
Why?

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:40.790
I'm sorry.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.420
I followed you.

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.130
I understand everything now.

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.750
Why you came here, and that incident.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.750
The way you've been acting strangely lately...
Everything.

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.170
The man you fell for, Muroga...

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:05.630
doesn't exist in this world.

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.250
Okay, thank you, both of you.

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:10.960
Yeah.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:13.500
Excellent.

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:15.540
The expression was spot-on.

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:17.420
It was good, right, Fujioka?

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.540
It was fantastic.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.460
Alright then...

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:22.920
Let's take a short break.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.960
We'll fine-tune the details after.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.040
- Let's take fifteen.
- Yes, sir.

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.630
Okay, fifteen-minute break.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:35.540
Kuroki-san.

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:36.750
Hmm?

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.540
I wanted to go over the last scene with you...

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:40.170
Oh.

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:41.920
It's our break right now. Are you sure?

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.830
Yeah, it's fine.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.130
Good work.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:45.630
Yamase-san.

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:46.460
Good work.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.670
Oh... you're here.

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:51.830
This is Yamase, he's a junior actor at my agency.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:52.830
Hello, everyone.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:53.960
Sorry to intrude.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.630
Please let him observe and learn.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.670
Ah, this... if you don't mind.

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.330
Please, everyone, have some.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:01.420
Yuki, here.

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.830
Yamase-san, you shouldn't have...

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:04.920
Yuki.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.580
It's common courtesy.

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:07.630
You're one to talk about "courtesy"...

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.960
Did you see that last scene?

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.540
I caught it from the doorway.

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:14.790
The scene with Muroga and Mitarai was amazing.

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:16.380
Thanks.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.580
He actually auditioned for this too.
Got cut in the first round.

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.540
That's not true! It wasn't the first round,
it was the second.

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.380
- The second round.
- Oh, sorry.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.670
Kuroki-san, would you like one?

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:28.750
Sure, thanks.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.290
Don't mind if I do.

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:32.920
Yamase-san, I'm digging in.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.130
Please do.

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.000
Not bad.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.960
- It's whatever.
- So, did you see my scene?

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.250
Well...

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:41.880
You didn't see it, huh?

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.040
Yamase-san, this is delicious!

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:45.380
Glad to hear it.

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:49.790
You've got some cream on you.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:50.960
Hmm?

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:52.250
Thanks.

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:53.540
Mm-hmm.

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:19.460
(Rain and Confession)

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.170
(Shirasaki Yuki, Kuroki Keita)

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:41.080
Hello?

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:42.460
Ah, Hayama?

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:44.880
Want to go out for a drink tonight?

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.500
Tonight...

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:48.710
I think I'll pass tonight.

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.250
Not in the mood?

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.830
I need to really dig into this movie script.

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.710
Actually, Yamase came by today.

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:59.960
We don't have rehearsal tomorrow,
so we decided to go for drinks.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.880
This guy named Kuroki is coming too.

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:06.250
Kuroki?

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:09.920
Yeah, the guy playing Shirasaki's best friend.

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.500
But, if it's a bad time for you...

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:15.170
No, I'll go.

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:16.500
You will?

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:18.580
See you at the usual spot, then.

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:19.330
Yeah.

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:20.630
Okay.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.290
Huh, he's here first.

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:35.130
- That's a first.
- Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:36.500
Sorry, rehearsal ran late.

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:37.710
No worries.

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:41.670
Wow, this is amazing.

00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:43.830
- This is my first time here, I'm blown away.
- There we go.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.540
Ah, Asami-san.

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:48.880
Let me introduce you.
This is Kuroki Keita-san.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.630
I'm Kuroki. It's a pleasure.

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:53.380
My name is Hayama.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:54.790
Nice to meet you.

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:56.330
Alright, have a seat.

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:57.250
Okay.

00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:58.920
- Ah, Kuroki-san, let me take your bag.
- Thanks.

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.170
Let's drink a lot tonight!

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:01.500
Let's do it.

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:03.290
What are you guys drinking?

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:04.460
Um... beer.

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:05.210
- Beer?
- Yeah.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:07.000
Hayama, the usual?

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:08.330
- Ah...
- Which one?

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:09.250
- Red wine.
- Got it.

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.170
I'll have a draft beer. A heavy one.

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:13.500
What's a heavy draft beer?

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:16.500
Cheers.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:44.790
Huh?

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.250
Aoyama-san didn't approve at first.

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:50.000
Yeah, he even thought about swapping their roles.

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:51.960
I don't know if he was serious.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.250
But it made me break out in a cold sweat.

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:56.170
But thanks to Kuroki-san's help...

00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:57.000
Help?

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:58.710
When I got to the rehearsal space this morning,

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:00.330
I heard a lot of noise.

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:01.960
Calling me noisy is a bit much.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.210
When I was practicing on my own,

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.250
Kuroki-san came and ran lines with me.

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:06.080
Yeah.

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:09.210
Thanks to him, I started to get a feel for
how to play the character of Muroga.

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:10.420
How should I put it?

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:12.170
Instead of just thinking with my head,

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:14.920
I was able to act on instinct.

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.460
I really felt that.

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:17.420
Oh?

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.880
It's like you had room to react to
your scene partner's performance.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:20.710
Really?

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:21.790
Yeah.

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:25.040
Doing scenes with Shirasaki felt incredibly liberating.

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:26.750
I'm so happy.

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:29.500
Is it the same for you, Hayama-san?

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:31.540
Huh?

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:35.080
No, I mean...
Your performance in "Daydream" was incredible.

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:38.580
The way you portrayed the space between two people
as they fell in love was perfect.

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:41.460
So good that it made me wonder
if you were actually dating in real life.

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:47.080
To receive such a compliment from you...

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:49.250
As an actor, it's the highest honor.

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:50.710
Thank you.

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:53.880
Organizing all these things logically...

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.170
to flesh out the character...

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:57.500
I get it, I get all that theory.

00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:00.170
But that feeling of becoming
one with the character...

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:01.710
That's not the point.

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:02.580
How do I say this...

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:04.170
Of course, the historical context is important.

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:06.080
They're really getting into it.

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:08.330
I think those things are important.

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:10.670
So, how was it?

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:12.330
How was what?

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:13.920
The rehearsal.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.040
You went, didn't you?

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:17.290
Well... yeah.

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:18.880
It was good.

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:21.540
Yuki was full of energy, too.

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:23.630
After all...

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:27.580
at the end, when Muroga tries to kill himself,
Mitarai stops him.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.460
The scene between them
is going to get even more intense.

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:34.130
When that happens,

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:38.290
the bond between the actors is sure to deepen.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:41.540
Especially Shirasaki.

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:44.040
He's the type to get really into his role, isn't he?

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.330
He gets completely absorbed in his scene partner.

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:52.170
Doesn't that worry you?

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:56.920
Worried about what?

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:02.130
It's nothing.

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:08.170
I had a great time today.

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:11.380
It's been so long since we all went out for drinks.

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:13.040
It has.

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:15.790
Huh?

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.960
Asami-san, didn't you have fun?

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.420
I had a great time, but...

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:28.170
But?

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:32.920
Huh?

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:36.710
What's wrong?

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.920
Hey, something seems off about you.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.210
Huh?

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:50.670
Huh?

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:52.000
Ah.

00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:55.540
Don't tell me you're...

00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:59.170
jealous?

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:02.750
Jealous?

00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:04.630
Yeah, the envious kind of jealous.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.170
I don't have much experience with this feeling,

00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:11.080
so I'm not entirely sure.

00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:12.500
Hmm, but...

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:14.460
haven't you acted jealous before, Asami-san?

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:16.170
You know, that feeling of jealousy.

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:19.290
That's true.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.580
When it comes to acting,

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:28.500
you observe good examples and commit them to memory,

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:31.080
and then you perform them.

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:34.080
Though I have been wanting to change that.

00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:37.210
Um, was the touching intentional?

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:39.710
Yeah.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.000
Because you and Kuroki were so chummy.

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:01.580
See? You are jealous.

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:21.210
There's no reason to be.

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:27.290
I never knew

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.460
I had this kind of emotion inside me.

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:34.330
Shirasaki is so endearing.

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.960
It's making it harder to let him go,
and that scares me a little.

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:43.380
Hey...

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:45.040
Yeah?

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:47.960
The play is about to open,

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:51.080
and my show is about to start filming.

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:53.830
How about we go somewhere before then?

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.330
Huh?

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:57.540
You mean... on a date?

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:02.420
Because we're both about to get a lot busier.

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:04.790
I want to go.

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:07.580
I really want to. Can we?

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:29.540
My dad's...

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.500
self-serving tales from his past.

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.580
How am I...

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:41.040
supposed to face him?

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:51.420
You can head home, Yamase.

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:55.750
It's fine. I'll stay with you.

00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:57.750
Thank you.

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:02.210
Sakuma.

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:05.830
On set, are you always
just cleaning up after Yuki and the others?

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:07.630
Huh?

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:11.330
That's just the feeling I got watching you rehearse today.

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:13.040
Hmm.

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:16.790
Putting your own needs aside...

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:18.420
That's not right, is it?

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:19.830
That's not it.

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:25.170
I mean that a lot of people
can relax because you're there.

00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:31.330
Stop focusing on what everyone else does well.

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:34.460
You need to recognize your own strengths.

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:40.500
Yamase, you're a good guy.

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:42.420
Come on, drink up...

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:44.790
Hey, don't drink too much.

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:46.210
I'm the one who'll have to take care of you.

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:48.420
I know.

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:49.460
I'll pour...

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:52.540
Just a little... Hey, that's too much.

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:53.580
- Jeez.
- Here.

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:55.330
- Cheers.
- Okay.

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:01.630
We're leaving after this drink.

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:02.670
Hmm?

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:04.290
- I don't wanna go home.
- Time to go.

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:06.500
- No way.
- You've had too much to drink.

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:08.920
I told you, I'm fine.

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:12.170
Huh?

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:13.960
You two are going on a date?

00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:15.580
Yeah.

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:17.040
Um...

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.210
Back then,

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:21.080
thanks for everything.

00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:22.750
Huh?

00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:25.330
Have we met somewhere before?

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:26.750
No...

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:29.710
I mean, it's not like you remember me.

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:32.040
Sorry, I can't quite place you...

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:34.290
I helped out on several of the film club's projects.

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:38.080
But I remember you,
Mihara. You were a senior in college.

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:41.000
I always thought you were very charming.

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:43.790
Really? That's great to hear.

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:46.790
Well, you left a big impression on me, Shirasaki.

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:48.830
Because I heard a lot about you from Hayama.

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:49.670
Huh?

00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:51.250
What was it again...?

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:54.460
Didn't you say something
when he got scouted by a modeling agency?

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:55.830
Hayama,

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.920
aren't you going to do any acting?

00:17:58.040 --> 00:17:59.630
What is wrong with you?

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:05.080
I always remembered it.
You said something incredibly rude.

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:06.040
I'm so sorry.

00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:07.420
Mihara.

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:09.170
Could you please stop teasing him?

00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:10.330
Because...

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:12.460
I can't help but tease people I find cute.

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:14.880
Let's get along from now on.

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:16.380
Okay.

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:20.750
What about me?

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.880
We're past that, aren't we?

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.210
All right...

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:23.920
Shirasaki, so this is where you wanted to come.

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:25.380
Yes.

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:28.170
I heard it was really beautiful here,

00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:30.790
so I wanted to see it with you, Asami-san.

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:37.250
I'm looking forward to it.

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:38.880
Yeah.

00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:41.460
Is this spot okay?

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:07.000
It's starting.

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:11.630
Today is October 11th.

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:15.750
Sunset today is at 5:11 p.m.

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:19.330
Now, let's gently fast-forward time

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:21.290
and wait for night to fall.

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:26.710
The winter constellations begin to appear.

00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:31.000
If you look up just a bit at the eastern sky,

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:34.080
you can see three stars lined up in a row.

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:37.790
Surrounding them are four bright stars.

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:40.330
This is the signature constellation of winter:

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:41.830
Orion.

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:46.290
The one that looks especially bright

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:49.750
is the red star on the left, Betelgeuse,

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:51.710
and the white star on the right...

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:11.290
That was beautiful.

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:12.710
It was.

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:15.790
It felt like the stars were
going to pour down on us.

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.670
I was so moved.

00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:20.960
Speaking of which,
I haven't come to the planetarium for...

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:22.710
I lost count on how many years.

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:24.330
Yeah.

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:28.830
This is probably my first time since elementary school.

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:31.540
I think it is for me, too.

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.130
I think I went to one when I was in the UK.

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:34.710
Oh?

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:37.380
Asami-san, you lived in the UK?

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:39.000
Yeah.

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:40.580
Because of my dad's work.

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:43.000
I lived there when I was in elementary school.

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:44.330
I see.

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:49.080
So that's why you like black tea so much.

00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:51.750
Maybe so.

00:21:57.250 --> 00:21:58.630
By the way.

00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:01.670
Asami-san, Your father...

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:05.920
He's working over there.

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:07.290
I see.

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:10.790
He works at a university.

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:11.790
Oh?

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:13.540
And he also writes novels.

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:15.210
A novelist?

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:18.210
That's amazing.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.630
So, Asami-san...

00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:28.500
you didn't choose to stay in the UK?

00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:30.500
No.

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:34.630
My mother's health declined,

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:36.920
so we came back to Japan.

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:43.460
My father left us

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:47.040
and went back to the UK alone.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.460
Oh.

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:55.790
Now, my father's novel

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:58.460
is being adapted into a film at a studio in the UK.

00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:00.420
Really?

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:04.000
It's an autobiographical novel,

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:11.170
and he wants me to play the lead.

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:16.790
Produced by an overseas studio.

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:18.830
Isn't that incredible?

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:22.670
Yeah.

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:29.420
Asami-san?

00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:44.080
(This is a work of fiction.)

00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:47.670
(Next Episode)
Are you going to star in your dad's movie?

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:50.920
Pouring out your own feelings.

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:52.580
What does that even mean?

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:53.710
