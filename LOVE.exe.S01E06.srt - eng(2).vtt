To think I woke up on time even after that whole ordeal...

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.670
means any drama with a guy doesn't affect me anymore.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.110
After going through enough trial and error,

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.680
I have a simple, efficient system for any romantic entanglements.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.620
All these past embarrassments are now just useful data.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.030

I'm surprised they have an automated motel out here.

Hey, that's Kang Min Hak.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.220
He's a really nice guy.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.280
Gosh, darn it!

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.290
- Maybe it's not automated. - Should we go somewhere else?

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.559
I'll get out of your way.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.020
I'll be gone in a second.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.630
- Oh, we can just go. - Just a minute!

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.760
Just because it's an automated motel doesn't mean no one's here.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.200
What if a toilet gets clogged? I have to be here to unclog it.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.070
And guests at your age go through 4 or 5 condoms a night, you know?

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.969
If they need more, I run them up.

We're on call for things like that, watching you on the cameras.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:44.939
- Cameras? - What?

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:45.940
- Let's go. - Let's go.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.710
Hold on. Wait a second!

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.480
Good grief, what are you saying?

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.550
No, not hidden cameras. He means the ones here in the lobby.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.219
Gosh, we'd never use hidden cameras.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.360
I have a kid your age.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.530
We're actually the cleanest motel in the area.

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.130
- We're even Clean Tag certified. - We did.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.560
I bet we're the only place around that disinfects it all with alcohol.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:07.670
This is creepy.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.130
Creepy? What's so creepy about it?

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.099
The security camera is over there.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.139
See? Right there.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.439
- Right here. - Let's just go.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.440

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.619
I wonder if our daughter will start using automated motels.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.189
Why would a motel owner's daughter do that?

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.060
She even went to high school with a dormitory to escape motels.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.330
Maybe we should get a kiosk.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.059
They say it does one person's job.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.630
Where would we get the money?

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.830
They're three thousand dollars, even used!

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.700
We spent all our extra cash getting a top ad spot on this booking app.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.410
The model on our booking app has a lovely smile, don't you think?

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.440
I like him smiling.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.250
What's so great about it?

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.550

Hope we get along well.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.660
Same here. This is the most exciting project!

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.230
So what made you change your mind?

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.130
Was it really because San asked you to join?

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.570
Well...

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.810
Ji No was a bit much for me.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.380
He was live-posting how many times I used the bathroom on social media.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.110
And...

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.950
- a teammate confessed she liked me. - A teammate? Who?

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.320
Them two? The ex-Treasurer's girlfriend?

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.660
So you made a couple break up.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.730
They started fighting and crying, and it was awkward in the middle.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.170
Anyway, the whole thing was a mess.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.170
But you all seemed completely uninterested in me.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.400
- What? - Like, whether I'm handsome or not,

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:54.910
popular or not,

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.839
none of that seemed to matter.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.180
You seemed to only want to focus on the work.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.050
Anyway, I'm a lot more comfortable with you guys.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.149
If so, you made a great choice.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.619
- Right, Na Rae? - Sure.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.319
No one's going to confess to Min Hak...

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.960
and make things hard for him, right?

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.090
- Not me, at least. - Never?

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.100
I wouldn't say never.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.660
- What? - What?

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:23.940
Maybe three percent?

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.400
What?

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:28.209
That's the probability of one of us...

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.940
falling for you, Kang Min Hak.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.010
- That's what my stats say. - Three percent?

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.349
Is that high?

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.880
Wait, what data are you using?

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.920
If the Apocalypse hits, you must help preserve the species.

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.490
Are you working on the premise of human extinction or something?

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.030
I'm surprised you feel responsible for future generations, San.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.270
So when it's not the end of the world,

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.370
would I have zero chance of being a couple with Min Hak?

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.640
Wait, can you guys just do that math in your head on the fly?

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.040
You guys are really something else.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.310
I know I'm not quite on your level,

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.050
but I promise I'll do my absolute best.

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.150
Let's do this!

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.690
- Let's do this! - Let's do this!

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.360
He just drew a line, right? "Don't you dare fall for me."

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:21.530
Yes.

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.800
Kang Min Hak's a real pro. Doesn't he know that's attractive?

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.800
- Lucky! - Nice.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.400
Lucky.

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.600
- Hello? - Joo Yeon San, where are you now?

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:35.540
- At school. - What floor are we on?

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:36.810
- Why? What's up? - First floor?

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.880
- Dad has a quick trip to Seoul. - For example,

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.849
- I told you about this before. - when you’re told not to think...

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:41.850
- about an elephant, - Remember?

00:05:41.851 --> 00:05:43.310
- that’s all you can think about. - Hello?

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.480
Did the call drop?

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.820
Conversely, what if Min Hak says, "I hope you fall for me?"

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.990
She'd probably just go, "Okay, I will."

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.530
Na Rae, we need to get paid.

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:58.960
Let's not scare Kang Min Hak off, all right?

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.170
I should add Min Hak to our group chat, right?

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.239
- Min Hak, welcome to the team. - Howdy.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.509
Howdy to you too.

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:10.510
I have a group meeting in 2 days at 3.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.180
What?

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.179
Hey, I told you to just freeload.

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.420
Why waste gas money coming here?

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.589
What if they only want to hit on you?

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:21.890
Be careful.

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.420
No way. With them, there's absolutely no...

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:27.230
Well, I wouldn't say never.

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:29.430
The probability is just extremely low.

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.560
Maybe a three percent chance?

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.130
That's according to my data.

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:38.040
Three percent? Get real.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.269
We don't have time for that.

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:41.739
There was an article saying...

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.370
Jinny's soju commercial contract was up.

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:45.610
Apparently, Amy is the next model. That's how this industry is.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.650
One is pushed out, another comes in. Min Hak, you must be the next one.

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:52.020
- Wait, this is 60 dollars? - Yes.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.149
The department jacket is 60 dollars?

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.290
They should be cheap to wear out.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.660
Lots of pockets, comfy as a pillow, and stain-resistant. That’s all.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.990
Right, because CompSci's design was a pillow with a fishing vest.

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:06.100
That was a great idea for storing your essentials in separate pockets.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.030
Except that option got almost no votes.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.270
That includes the logo design fee, and the Tatami embroidery is pricey.

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:15.210
But it's black-on-black embroidery. You can't even see it.

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:17.179
No one will see this as a department jacket.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:18.740
That's the whole point.

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:24.350
If we don't hit the minimum order, the price goes up even more.

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:26.150
Come on. You think we won't?

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:29.950
Hey, everyone, wait up! Come here and try this on.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:32.960
Is that the jacket?

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.360
- Hold on. - Is that the jacket?

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.560
- Hold on. - This is way too big.

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.669
Hold on. Hey, stop pushing.

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:42.930
Excuse me! I need to get out.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.470
Excuse me! We're packed in too tight.

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:49.140
One idea from each of you by the day after tomorrow.

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:50.640
(One idea from each of you by the day after tomorrow)

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:53.380
Of course, this isn't a competition for the best proposal or anything.

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:55.810
Got it!

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.150
(Kang Min Hak: Got it!)

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:01.420
- You're here. - Goodness!

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:02.920
Dad!

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.920
Some dried anchovies and shredded squid.

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:07.960
And this is seasoned deodeok root, your favourite.

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:10.460
I didn't know you were coming.

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:12.060
Would tomorrow be any different?

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:14.869
And a hydrating, nourishing ampoule.

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:17.100
Kills two birds with one stone.

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:20.000
Mom sent this for your dry skin.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.240
Here, use it.

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:23.880
Hey, what's this?

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.009
This is a classic from my day.

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:27.410
Is this the Gen Z vibe now?

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:30.349
Gosh, do you even cook for yourself?

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:32.480
What's all this? Clean this up.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.190
You just let it pile up. When is recycling day?

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:38.390
Don't throw that away. I'm saving it to sell.

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:39.960
I get more money for a full box.

00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:42.530
Gosh, the dildo!

00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:45.000
Dad! I'll clean this up.

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:46.759
- No, I'll do it. - Really, I've got it.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.800
Since I'm here, I'll just clean the whole place.

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:50.000
Well, actually,

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:54.240
the caulking under the toilet needs to be redone.

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:55.340
- The caulking? - Yes.

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:56.470
I'll work on it after this.

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:58.410
- No, don't. - Why are you pushing me?

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.710
- Please go check on it now. - Why are you pushing me?

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.520
It looks perfectly fine to me.

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:08.250
It doesn't even wobble when I sit on it.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:12.860
There's nothing wrong with it.

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.030
No, it's a huge problem.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.330
Did you actually sit down?

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:18.800
I'm telling you, it rattles and shakes when you sit down.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:20.770
- Really? - Just caulk it anyway.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.840
The real problem is the mold.

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:29.670
Are you cleaning out the cabinets now?

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.080
Leave it. I'll take care of all that for you tomorrow.

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.180
No, it's okay. You don't have to do this part.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.180
There's some personal girl stuff in there.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:37.979
- Is that right? - Yes.

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.020
So you keep that kind of stuff in the kitchen?

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:42.150
So, Dad, why did you say you were in town again?

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:46.460
Oh, right. I have a wedding to go to this weekend.

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:49.390
So you're staying here until then?

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:52.400
Yes. It's not for business.

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:54.700
I wanted a change of scenery and to meet up with some friends.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.670
I don't need you to co-sign anything!

00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:58.540
All right.

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:00.810
Then I'll just stay out of your hair.

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:03.840
But just this one thing.

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:07.210
Why is he popping up there?

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:09.010
This model guy.

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:10.980
Doesn't he go to your school?

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:13.680
Could you get me his autograph?

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.120
You're not asking me to get it, are you?

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:17.319
Yes, and tell him I'm a huge fan.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.719
When I'm down, seeing him smile...

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.659
just makes me smile too.

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:22.530
And tell him to keep looking good.

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:24.060
What are you even talking about?

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:26.860
Why not? If our motel has a star's autograph,

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:28.199
think how great that would be.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.200
It builds credibility.

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:30.740
Here.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:34.810
(Number one in Customer Satisfaction)

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:36.140
(Today, right now...)

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:41.350
(penguintan0129)

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.050
Should I follow him first?

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:46.750
(penguintan0129 started following you)

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:49.589
Na Rae, are you home?

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:50.650
(Gil Tan: Na Rae, are you home?)

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:52.860
Yes. What's up?

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:56.990
Perfect. I just need a roll of toilet paper.

00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:58.630
I'll give you two back tomorrow.

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:00.360
Just toss it out the window.

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:02.400
What the?

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:03.770
Okay.

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:23.020
Catch.

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:24.560
Throw it.

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:26.620
Thank you.

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.890
Seriously? He followed me just to ask for toilet paper?

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:43.110
(SUPER LIKE! Swipe to find out who)

(Memory Motel)

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:58.960
Did Dad go out?

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:05.060
(Hangang University)

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:12.840
We're set for the hotel staycation vlog tomorrow.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.510
- Where? - Right across the street.

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:19.210
Don't tell me it's one of those motels over there.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.880
It's a franchise,

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:24.480
and I didn't see the point in going far to film.

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:27.490
I asked the branch near the school to make it easy for you.

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:30.119
I don't mind travelling.

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:31.790
I do. It's a pain for me.

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.760
You can just walk there and back.

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:39.100
I'm kidding. They remodelled anyway, so it looks good.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:45.940
Where could Dad have gone so early?

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:49.710
Is that Kang Min Hak?

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:53.940
What was that? Did I just wave at Kang Min Hak?

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:57.150
- It was the client's request. - Let me out here.

00:12:58.680 --> 00:12:59.680
Why? What's wrong?

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:01.690
Why? Hey...

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:03.450
See you later.

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:05.790
What's going on?

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:10.160
Close the door!

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.430
San! Joo Yeon San!

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.340
- Hi. - Hi.

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:19.440
How did you know it was me?

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:21.110
It's hard to see inside.

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:23.670
I'd know that mint car anywhere.

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:27.340
I have a favour to ask. It's fine if you won't do it.

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:28.880
From me?

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:30.850
- Right. - What is it?

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.820
Well, my dad runs a motel.

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:36.220
And it turns out you're the model for the booking app he uses.

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:39.260
He's a big fan and asked if I could get your autograph.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:41.160
An autograph?

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:45.530
This brings back memories of when we first met.

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:48.170
- If you're making a dumb joke... - What's his name?

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:50.130
- Sorry? - Your father's name.

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:52.400
Right.

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:54.140
Joo Jong Hwan.

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:56.370
- Jong Hwan? - Yes.

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:02.710
- San. - Yes?

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:04.320
Can you turn around for a second?

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:05.879
- I need to use your back. - My back?

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:07.180
- Just for this. Yes. - Okay.

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:11.920
Hold on.

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:17.600
(Right Here)

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:23.430
By the way,

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:25.040
did you come all the way to campus just for this?

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:28.870
Of course not. I had no idea when you'd be here.

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:30.440
Right.

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:35.180
There we go.

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:39.020
Thanks. I didn't misspell it this time.

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:41.920
Right, though that wasn't why you misspelled it last time.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:45.360
Hey, you.

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:48.290
Is this how you act in meetings, too?

00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:49.890
Hey.

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:52.260
You can't keep coming on to him.

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:54.770
Don't misuse his kindness.

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:57.270
I wanted to do it, so I asked her for it.

00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:01.370
How is this crossing a line? This is just being nice to a fan.

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:04.980
- You waste time on useless stuff... - If it wasn't for my dad...

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:07.109
You grant every trivial favour asked.

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:08.410
Do you know how frustrating that is?

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:12.050
That's right. My dad's a lot, so I asked a favour.

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:16.050
I won't bother you again, so you should watch your words too.

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:19.420
So I don't waste more of your time, I'll be on my way.

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:22.590
Hey...

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:28.430
Why didn't you just keep driving if you were just going to clam up?

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:29.670
Come on.

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:31.770
She's really something else.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.270
(To Joo Jong Hwan, Thank you, Kang Min Hak)

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:39.140
At least this will keep Dad off my back.

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:45.680
Okay, I'm leaving. Right away.

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:47.180
What?

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:54.160
Oh, dear.

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:58.800
- What's going on? - You can just take that one, then.

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:00.130
- Does this one go there? - Yes.

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:01.200
Okay. Perfect.

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:04.340
You've gone to so much trouble for me today.

00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:11.480
Why is Dad at a motel with another woman?

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:17.750
Of all potential family problems, an affair was...

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.780
something I thought had less than a three percent chance of happening.

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:23.820
You said it was a little loose, so I fixed it.

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:25.790
I'm almost done.

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:28.930
Just be careful not to get it wet for about three days.

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:31.260
So, where were you today?

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:35.630
Me? I went to Seoul to meet up with a friend.

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:37.270
Since the crack of dawn?

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:39.340
Getting older makes time precious.

00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:59.220
I'm just going to step out for a bit.

00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:00.690
Where'd my socks go?

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:04.430
Am I jumping to conclusions? Or am I just slow to see the truth?

00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:06.660
Something feels off.

00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:10.370
- "Want to meet up later?" - Hey, why are you reading that?

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:12.799
Your Tinder match? Hey, let me see his picture.

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.440
Let's see if he's a good one this time.

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:18.580
"This time?" I've barely used it. You're being so extra.

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:21.550
- You said he was a hot guy. - When did I say "hot guy?"

00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:25.820
I was just doing market research, checking out the dating app scene.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.820
How can you trust someone enough to meet them from an app?

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:29.850
Seriously? We're developing an app right now.

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.020
Let's not hate on apps.

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:32.960
If there are problems with these kinds of apps,

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:35.590
we need to think about what solutions we can provide.

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:36.690
Minimize the risks,

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.030
and have an eye for enhancing the positive functions and benefits.

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.229
Having an eye for those things...

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:42.600
is how you come up with good ideas.

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:44.570
So, did you come up with a good idea?

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:45.740
Of course I did.

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:46.840
I've been thinking,

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:49.140
since it's people our age voting on this anyway,

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:52.180
we definitely have to do something related to dating.

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:54.339
"Does he like me?"

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:56.550
"Or who does she like?"

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:58.679
"Who gives me the biggest hit of dopamine?"

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:00.580
That's all that matters for those in their 20s.

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:02.050
Not for me.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:08.630
Sure, some people are like you, but we want mass appeal, right?

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:11.299
Why else would a show set in some shabby-looking guesthouse...

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:12.860
with a regular guys and girls, like on "I Am Solo,"

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:16.530
be more popular than a huge drama with A-list stars?

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:19.770
So you're saying we should launch something kind of like Tinder?

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:23.240
No way. We have to approach it differently.

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:26.680
Something cute that only we can pull off.

00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:31.920
For example, an alarm that goes off if someone you like is within 10m,

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:33.820
something like the "Love Alarm."

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:36.620
The fact that it's been adapted into a webtoon and a drama...

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:39.290
shows what the public desires.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:43.330
But is it even possible to actually make that?

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:47.530
It's appeared on TV shows, but commercializing it will be hard.

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:50.230
Even if it's not the "Love Alarm,"

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:52.500
we can make an app to help with love.

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.710
Recommending nice places for anniversaries,

00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:58.380
showing available discounts, and suggesting places like hotels.

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:00.910
How often do students really go to hotels?

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:03.850
Maybe not hotels, but trust me, they go to motels all the time.

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:10.390
For example, going on a hotel staycation with friends?

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:13.390
Should we do that sometime?

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:16.190
Right. A "Right Here" hotel opened up front.

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:17.930
The hotel that opened up out front?

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:19.730
Where? In the middle of all these motels?

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.670
Yes. I'm here to film a vlog today.

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:24.970
I heard it was newly renovated.

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:27.540
Should I send some gift certificates for the chain?

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:29.910
Gift certificates? Yes, please.

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:32.840
It's just that I'm an ambassador for this app.

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:36.280
Please. They just renovated a motel and slapped "hotel" on the sign.

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:38.080
Seriously? Right in front of the ambassador?

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:40.120
That word always cracks me up.

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:42.050
Why does everyone call commercial models...

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:43.150
"ambassadors" these days?

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:45.359
Hey, there must be some difference.

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.389
Anyway, that's great, Min Hak.

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:48.760
Let us know how it is once you've been.

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:51.190
I don't get why people go to motels when they have their own homes.

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.830
A house isn't always the most private place.

00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:57.770
Motels are so bad for the environment.

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:01.140
What's with the friendly fire? Your family runs a motel, you know.

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:02.610
That's how I know.

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:04.740
The amount of disposables is insane.

00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:06.210
Toothbrushes, toothpaste, cotton swabs,

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:08.880
and even used condoms.

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:11.209
You know what the trash looks like?

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:12.780
It's like the building took a dump.

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:13.850
Not to mention...

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:21.830
They're also breeding grounds for affairs.

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:25.400
Yeon San.

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:30.169
Why would you call your family's business a dump?

00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:31.270
Right.

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:33.139
San, I get your concern,

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:35.010
but motels partnered with "Right Here..."

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:36.910
are supposedly run in a very eco-friendly way.

00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:39.380
They use bamboo toothbrushes,

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:42.380
and you can even opt out of receiving amenities.

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:44.450
I wasn't talking about you.

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:49.090
I know. But still, I'm their ambassador.

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:50.920
The "ambassador."

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:53.790
You know I care for the environment.

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:55.490
So when I sign an endorsement deal,

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:58.460
I always make sure the company is eco-friendly.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.200
And I recently...

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.170
became a golf course ambassador.

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:05.569
- A golf course? - And they're even partnered...

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:08.170
with a recycled apparel company.

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:12.480
How is a golf course eco-friendly?

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:16.810
San, you've never been to one, have you?

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:19.720
They're incredibly eco-friendly.

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:23.190
- Okay, let's get back on topic. - Right.

00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:25.519
Especially the golf club I promote, the "Stay Green Golf Course,"

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:27.290
has such beautiful natural surroundings.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:28.889
Birds are chirping all over,

00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:30.790
and you can see fish swimming in the lake.

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:32.900
I'll give you some guest passes, so you should come sometime...

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:35.600
They build golf courses by literally carving up mountains.

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:37.830
Carving up mountains?

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:39.470
But there are tons of trees there.

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:43.170
The trees were moved from elsewhere, and the fish were just put there.

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:48.150
The grass is perfectly manicured. It's so lush and green.

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:50.909
Do you know how much pesticide they use to keep that grass green?

00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:53.250
What about the major water shortages that municipalities face every year?

00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:57.050
And yet they waste tons of water on golf courses to keep them green?

00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:59.120
What does that have to do with anything?

00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:02.860
He can learn now. He's all heart, not brains. Right?

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:04.060
"Not brains?"

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:06.530
- "Brains." - Kang Min Hak,

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:08.130
I see environment care is...

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:10.800
- just an accessory for you. - An accessory?

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:13.540
Why would you call it an accessory?

00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:15.570
I'm being serious.

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.240
Okay.

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:20.210
If you're being genuine,

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:23.910
then you're a perfect case study...

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:25.520
of how people unintentionally ruin the world.

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:30.490
So you're saying I'm destroying the world?

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:34.590
When you're that ignorant, instead of trying to be responsible,

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:36.489
it's better to just stay quiet.

00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:38.929
Especially for someone like you, who clearly influences others,

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:41.230
being ignorant is being irresponsible!

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:46.100
San.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.000
Hey!

00:22:57.450 --> 00:22:58.820
(I'm an alum. Can I still buy a department jacket?)

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:00.120
(Dong Won, I'm one of Jae Seon's seniors.)

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:01.490
(I heard the department jackets are sold out.)

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:03.950
Dong Won, planning another round of department jacket orders?

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:09.430
(Department Jacket World)

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.260
What is going on?

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:15.400
Hey, Hold on!

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:20.100
I keep getting calls for department jackets,

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:21.940
even from the alumni.

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:23.210
Look at this.

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:28.110
We got so many requests to buy one, so we made an Outsider Edition.

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:33.150
Just from this morning's pre-orders, we've already sold over 300.

00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:36.790
What? Who'd buy other school's jacket?

00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:39.860
- We just passed 400. - What?

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:41.889
The Outsider Edition is profitable.

00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:43.090
I marked up the price a little.

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:47.800
- Which means... - We've hit the jackpot.

00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:59.910
We got that sponsored skincare, so put some on after you wash up.

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:02.679
It has the eco ingredients you like.

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:04.349
So give it a shout-out on camera.

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:05.419
(Eco-friendly golf course)

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:07.650
This is just a simple product placement.

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:10.650
Hey, are you even listening to me?

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:13.820
This is a field I might know more about than you.

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:16.830
Skincare?

00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:19.830
Right. Of course you'd know more.

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:24.940
But still, for the business side, you promised you'd trust me on this.

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:26.839
I just went with a brand that was easy to negotiate with.

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:27.899
(Eco-friendly golf course)

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:29.340
Not much is coming up on Naver.

00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:32.940
Okay, I'll get your opinion first from now on.

00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:37.150
Golf course.

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:39.580
Eco-friendly golf course.

00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:41.279
(Golf course. Eco-friendly golf course)

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:42.290
Eco...

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:45.159
(Golf course. Eco-friendly golf course)

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:46.820
- A golf course? - Eco...

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:49.960
So you're itching to get out on the green?

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:52.460
Okay, I'll book a tee time right now.

00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:53.660
(So you're itching to get out...)

00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:57.470
But for today's vlog, at least, we must plug this Schwanengarten.

00:24:57.530 --> 00:24:58.540
Hey!

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:02.010
Sorry, just be quiet for a minute.

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:03.870
Please.

00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:07.940
(But for today's vlog, at least, we must plug this Schwanengarten.)

00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:10.950
The search isn't working.

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:20.160
Eco-friendly golf course.

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:27.700
I got way too worked up because of my dad.

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:31.600
I ended up projecting my issues onto an innocent Kang Min Hak.

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:36.510
I need to reflect on how I was being logical, yet illogical.

00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:42.850
Same thing here.

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:46.180
Ignoring a problem you know exists only makes it worse.

00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:51.790
Instead of nectar from flowers, bees are intoxicated by pesticides.

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:53.160
They were wiped out in massive numbers.

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:55.130
The cause is a neighbouring golf course.

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:58.160
They had drenched the greens in pesticides the day before.

00:25:58.430 --> 00:26:00.660
Mother bees, father bees, baby bees...

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:06.440
So she was right all along.

00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:09.810
She was right about everything.

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:16.610
There's no such thing as an "eco-friendly" golf course.

00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:24.050
I'm so sorry, little bees.

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:28.390
And the rabbits,

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:29.460
the deer too.

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:34.430
I'm sorry to all of you.

00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:37.630
For a stupid ball game, I...

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:39.570
No, not me, but...

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:42.710
We destroyed all your homes.

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:46.940
We humans are sorry.

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:50.650
Mom.

00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:52.120
Mom.

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:56.320
(Ward A)

00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:01.290
Thank you for always calling me Mom so freely.

00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:02.760
But you are my mom.

00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:05.160
No matter what, you'll always be my mom.

00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:11.199
Min Hak, you take after your father.

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:12.700
With that handsome face of yours,

00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:14.740
it'll be very easy for you to win people's hearts.

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:17.770
But what's important...

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:20.510
isn't that brief moment when you win someone's heart,

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:24.450
it's holding onto that heart responsibly for the long haul.

00:27:24.650 --> 00:27:26.350
When you make a mistake or do something wrong,

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:28.280
you have to own up to it and apologise right away.

00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:30.190
That's what a good person does.

00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:34.560
Your father and I couldn't do that,

00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:37.130
but you should be a good person, Min Hak.

00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:42.200
Make sure you listen to your grandfather, okay?

00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:45.270
Ma'am, when you go to Australia, be wary of the Korean community.

00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:47.870
The people who prey on Koreans overseas the most...

00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:49.470
are other Koreans.

00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:51.310
All right. Thank you for looking out for me.

00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:52.840
Take care, Jae Hak.

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:57.010
(Ward A)

00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:59.650
Mom. Don't go.

00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:00.850
Mom.

00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:05.220
This is all because your father lived like a playboy.

00:28:05.290 --> 00:28:06.319
I should know.

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:09.330
I once lived off these dashing good looks myself.

00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:13.660
But it's just a fleeting shortcut to total ruin.

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:18.300
It takes more than a pretty face to be a real man.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.140
Min Hak.

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:21.940
Mark my words.

00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:25.009
You heard what that woman said?

00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:28.080
Just because the ladies like you, don't let it go to your head...

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:30.110
and blame the world for everything.

00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:33.220
If you keep blaming everyone else, you'll end up just like your father.

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:35.890
A pretty flower that's quick to wilt.

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:37.690
A playboy.

00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:42.390
That's exactly who I was.

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:44.130
Irresponsible,

00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:46.600
a pretty boy who was nothing more than a flower.

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:50.030
Just like an eco-friendly golf course.

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:13.960
They say, "The first flower to bloom is the first to wilt."

00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:18.130
Because of global warming, cherry blossoms are blooming early.

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.660
Maybe my hair loss, too.

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:24.670
Schwanengarten sent me some of their cosmetics to try,

00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:26.940
so I've been using them, and I absolutely love them.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.840
(So handsome in the ad! Going to watch it again)

00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:33.640
I think this is going to be my new go-to.

00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:34.810
(Your skin is perfect.)

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:37.380
I love that it keeps my skin hydrated all day long,

00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:41.990
and everything from the ingredients to the packaging is eco-friendly.

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:44.090
(That face is magic. Did Hogwarts send an owl?)

00:29:44.150 --> 00:29:45.720
(Seriously, don't you dare work out. You're already too perfect.)

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:47.260
(Is something wrong? Your expression suddenly changed.)

00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:48.560
(You seem down today. Are you okay?)

00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:49.960
(You're not sick, are you? I'm worried)

00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:51.160
(What's wrong?)

00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:52.760
(I'm worried. You don't seem like yourself.)

00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:54.400
(I missed the start of the stream. Did something happen?)

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:56.070
(Just got here. What's with the vibe?)

00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:57.670
(Who gets depressed while putting on lotion?)

00:29:57.730 --> 00:30:00.140
Eco-friendly...

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:05.740
(Safety first)

00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:36.270
(Smooth Taste, Like Dew)

00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:37.510
(No.1 Soju, made with spring water)

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:39.440
Jinny.

00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:46.120
When will I finally be a responsible adult?

00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:48.050
Someone who pulls their own weight?

00:30:48.650 --> 00:30:50.389
Man, I'm so horny today.

00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:51.419
- Let's go. - I really need to get laid.

00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:53.160
- Let's do it. I'll make a call. - I want to do it.

00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:54.360
- No way. - Seriously.

00:30:54.890 --> 00:30:56.990
Look, Jinny's passed out.

00:30:57.230 --> 00:31:00.900
I should help our girl Jinny up.

00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:03.999
Hey, knock her over, you idiot.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.899
When else do we get her on her back?

00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:06.940
Hey.

00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:09.270
Who says you have to do it lying down, you punk?

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:14.210
- You can do it standing up too. - This punk's an animal when drunk.

00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:15.679
That fool.

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:18.180
- Hey, stop it. - Why can't anyone just grow up?

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:21.680
- Stop it, that's disgusting. - Dude, you're going too far.

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:24.720
Hey, people are watching! I said stop!

00:31:24.790 --> 00:31:28.490
- Hey, you're acting crazy. - Here, let me try.

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:29.890
Stop it, there are people around.

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:32.460
- Just stop it! - Hey!

00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:43.910
What do you want?

00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:46.410
(Smooth Taste, Like Dew)

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:47.780
Darn it.

00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:51.280
Come on.

00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:58.220
- What the... - Is that guy a pervert or what?

00:31:58.290 --> 00:32:00.590
- Sir, that guy took it! - That pervert, that's him!

00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:02.330
- Get him! He's a pervert. - Stop, thief!

00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:06.730
I should just get out of here.

00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:09.300
I need to pull my own weight.

00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:11.170
I will pull my weight right now.

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:13.470
It's time to be an adult.

00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:22.050
I'm so sorry.

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:23.710
Kang Min Hak?

00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:26.820
San? What are you doing here?

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:30.120
Miss! Stop that guy. He's a pervert!

00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:54.280
- What's going on? - Get back here, you pervert!
