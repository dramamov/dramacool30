- Congratulations, Cho Na Jeong.
- Congrats.

00:00:36.468 --> 00:00:38.971
See? I told you she'd pull it off.

00:00:38.971 --> 00:00:41.406
I can't believe you beat 100-to-1 odds.

00:00:41.406 --> 00:00:42.241
Is that even possible?

00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:43.242
I told you so.

00:00:43.242 --> 00:00:45.744
She was never meant to rot away at home.

00:00:45.744 --> 00:00:47.012
Thanks, guys.

00:00:47.012 --> 00:00:50.582
So everything is on me tonight.

00:00:50.582 --> 00:00:51.950
Eat all you want.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.128
This is good.

00:01:03.428 --> 00:01:05.297
- Thanks, girl.
- Yeah.

00:01:06.265 --> 00:01:08.133
But when's Sang Gyu coming?

00:01:08.467 --> 00:01:10.435
No idea.
We can just have fun without him.

00:01:10.435 --> 00:01:11.770
He's the one who begged to join anyway.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.005
How's he been?

00:01:13.005 --> 00:01:15.274
I think I heard he was in Busan.

00:01:15.274 --> 00:01:16.275
So, how was he?

00:01:16.275 --> 00:01:17.576
Did he glow up or fall apart?

00:01:18.143 --> 00:01:20.379
He's pretty much the same.

00:01:20.712 --> 00:01:21.814
Seriously?

00:01:21.814 --> 00:01:24.049
So he's still that scruffy artist type?

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:27.219
When I think of Sang Gyu,
all I see is that seaweed hair.

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:30.122
He probably thought
it looked cool like this.

00:01:30.122 --> 00:01:31.456
Flicking it like this.

00:01:32.491 --> 00:01:33.358
Hey.

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.460
I know I looked ridiculous.

00:01:36.728 --> 00:01:37.629
Sang Gyu.

00:01:37.629 --> 00:01:39.731
A glow-up.

00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:42.568
Hop on.

00:01:43.335 --> 00:01:44.136
No.

00:01:44.136 --> 00:01:46.572
- Not this back, the other one.
- The other one.

00:01:46.872 --> 00:01:48.640
I need a different back.

00:01:49.041 --> 00:01:51.977
Lee Il Ri, stop acting up,
and let's go home.

00:01:51.977 --> 00:01:53.979
Come on, get on my back.

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.214
Hop on so we can leave.

00:01:56.949 --> 00:01:58.350
I said no.

00:02:01.086 --> 00:02:02.287
Can you even carry her?

00:02:03.555 --> 00:02:04.690
Hey, we're heading out first.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.425
- Get home safe.
- See you.

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:09.161
Honestly, every time she drank,

00:02:09.161 --> 00:02:11.230
she refused to get on everyone's back...

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.499
except Sang Gyu's.

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:14.833
Why were you like that?

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.934
What are you talking about?

00:02:15.934 --> 00:02:18.670
I was drunk! I just rode on anyone's back.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.239
Hey, what did you just say?

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:22.708
You said no to everyone else
but looked for me.

00:02:22.708 --> 00:02:23.609
- Yeah.
- Right.

00:02:23.876 --> 00:02:25.477
I don't remember that.

00:02:27.146 --> 00:02:28.247
Here you go again.

00:02:51.503 --> 00:02:52.404
Hey.

00:02:52.404 --> 00:02:54.173
I think Sang Gyu's into you.

00:02:55.007 --> 00:02:55.808
No way.

00:02:55.808 --> 00:02:57.309
Seriously.

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:58.710
He only had eyes for you.

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.045
Hey, got for it with him.

00:03:00.045 --> 00:03:02.514
Yes, and the timing is perfect too.

00:03:03.315 --> 00:03:05.384
But I like handsome guys.

00:03:05.918 --> 00:03:08.620
What? He's actually good-looking.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.655
Yeah.

00:03:11.757 --> 00:03:13.258
Naraeng and Joobari, your taxis are here.

00:03:13.258 --> 00:03:14.193
Thanks.

00:03:14.493 --> 00:03:15.327
Good luck.

00:03:16.862 --> 00:03:18.964
- Let's go.
- Okay. See you.

00:03:19.398 --> 00:03:20.699
See you, Joobari.

00:03:28.073 --> 00:03:28.907
Get home safe.

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:47.860
What?

00:03:48.327 --> 00:03:50.762
I thought he was plain,
but he's kind of cute.

00:03:51.897 --> 00:03:53.966
Actually, not bad at all.

00:03:58.137 --> 00:03:59.004
By the way,

00:04:00.005 --> 00:04:01.773
how'd you go from a business major...

00:04:02.241 --> 00:04:03.775
to a manual therapist?

00:04:05.377 --> 00:04:06.745
When I was a kid,

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:08.814
my parents were always out working,

00:04:08.814 --> 00:04:09.948
so my grandma raised me.

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:11.984
Then, when I was 29 or so,

00:04:12.484 --> 00:04:14.419
she got into a bad accident...

00:04:15.053 --> 00:04:16.288
and couldn't walk again.

00:04:16.288 --> 00:04:18.423
So I quit acting...

00:04:18.423 --> 00:04:20.559
and went down to Busan to care for her.

00:04:20.559 --> 00:04:24.229
I tried learning everything I could
to help her walk again,

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:26.064
and somehow, I ended up here.

00:04:27.933 --> 00:04:29.868
Is your neck okay now?

00:04:31.303 --> 00:04:32.404
Yes.

00:04:32.938 --> 00:04:34.339
Dude, you've got magic hands.

00:04:34.873 --> 00:04:37.109
It feels so much better
thanks to your therapy.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:38.944
Thanks, dude.

00:04:39.678 --> 00:04:40.679
Good, I'm glad.

00:04:42.714 --> 00:04:44.550
You're not that young anymore.

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.186
So don't go drinking
and passing out anywhere.

00:04:47.186 --> 00:04:48.287
You'll ruin your health.

00:04:48.921 --> 00:04:51.089
Excuse me? When did I ever?

00:04:51.089 --> 00:04:53.392
That was when I was young.
I don't do that anymore.

00:04:59.031 --> 00:05:00.098
She reeks of alcohol.

00:05:15.314 --> 00:05:17.216
You can go now. We're here.

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:18.584
Go where?

00:05:18.884 --> 00:05:19.818
Why?

00:05:20.152 --> 00:05:22.087
You don't want to say goodbye yet?

00:05:22.454 --> 00:05:23.355
What are you talking about?

00:05:24.022 --> 00:05:26.258
You want another drink with me?

00:05:26.725 --> 00:05:28.327
This isn't our last day.

00:05:28.794 --> 00:05:29.728
What are you saying?

00:05:30.796 --> 00:05:32.965
Hey, my place is right...

00:05:38.003 --> 00:05:39.571
Wait. You live here?

00:05:39.805 --> 00:05:41.140
No way, you too?

00:05:46.512 --> 00:05:48.981
What are the odds?

00:05:48.981 --> 00:05:50.716
You mean you live right across from me?

00:05:50.716 --> 00:05:52.384
How's that even possible?

00:05:54.786 --> 00:05:58.257
Well, these days, neighbors barely
even say hi anymore.

00:05:59.358 --> 00:06:01.193
Still, that's good for you.

00:06:02.261 --> 00:06:03.395
What do you mean?

00:06:03.662 --> 00:06:06.431
Now you don't have to worry about creeps.

00:06:06.765 --> 00:06:09.134
If some guy ever follows you,
call me right away.

00:06:09.134 --> 00:06:10.302
Got it?

00:06:10.302 --> 00:06:12.204
What the heck. He's confusing me.

00:06:13.172 --> 00:06:14.173
Is he flirting with me or what?

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.508
Unbelievable.

00:06:21.013 --> 00:06:21.780
Bye, then.

00:06:22.481 --> 00:06:23.448
Good night.

00:06:24.016 --> 00:06:25.384
Yeah, you too.

00:06:30.355 --> 00:06:32.457
Il Ri, later, if you...

00:06:40.332 --> 00:06:41.500
What's this?

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.101
Why are you in my home without permission?

00:06:43.101 --> 00:06:45.671
If you're going to pack my stuff,
at least do it properly.

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:49.041
You didn't give me my tablet,
so I couldn't even work.

00:06:49.041 --> 00:06:50.943
You could've just texted me.

00:06:50.943 --> 00:06:53.512
Why come to my house without permission?

00:06:53.512 --> 00:06:55.147
I did, but you didn't even reply.

00:06:55.948 --> 00:06:57.716
I'm swamped as it is.

00:06:58.851 --> 00:06:59.685
But who's that?

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:05.257
Why do you care?

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:16.735
- This...
- I'm sorry, dude.

00:07:17.469 --> 00:07:19.538
That's someone I used to date.

00:07:19.838 --> 00:07:21.740
He got so clingy it was disgusting,

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:23.175
- so I dumped him.
- I see.

00:07:23.175 --> 00:07:25.410
But I forgot to change the door code,

00:07:26.278 --> 00:07:28.180
and he came in like a stalker.

00:07:28.814 --> 00:07:30.682
I was so scared
so I pretended you were my boyfriend.

00:07:30.682 --> 00:07:31.583
I'm sorry.

00:07:31.583 --> 00:07:33.051
No.

00:07:33.519 --> 00:07:34.786
You did the right thing.

00:07:35.587 --> 00:07:36.788
How creepy.

00:07:37.489 --> 00:07:39.825
He was being so persistent,

00:07:39.825 --> 00:07:42.227
so I kept ignoring his calls.

00:07:42.227 --> 00:07:43.962
And now he just shows up like that.

00:07:48.867 --> 00:07:49.735
Anyway,

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:52.938
I'm so glad...

00:07:54.072 --> 00:07:55.607
you live right across.

00:07:57.409 --> 00:07:59.178
I told you.

00:07:59.178 --> 00:08:01.213
You don't have to worry about creeps.

00:08:06.819 --> 00:08:08.287
- Is he gone?
- Is he gone? Let's see.

00:08:11.023 --> 00:08:12.157
- He's gone.
- He's gone.

00:08:13.559 --> 00:08:14.726
Yes, he's gone.

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:16.395
Thank goodness.

00:08:23.001 --> 00:08:24.203
Well...

00:08:25.737 --> 00:08:26.939
I'll get going then.

00:08:26.939 --> 00:08:28.240
- Yes.
- Okay.

00:08:29.775 --> 00:08:30.776
Yeah, I'm off.

00:08:37.149 --> 00:08:38.817
But Il Ri,

00:08:38.817 --> 00:08:41.687
shouldn't you change your door code now?

00:08:42.754 --> 00:08:44.389
What if I'm gone...

00:08:44.389 --> 00:08:45.824
and he just shows up again?

00:08:46.191 --> 00:08:47.659
Yeah, good point.

00:08:48.627 --> 00:08:49.695
Should I, then?

00:08:50.462 --> 00:08:52.064
Yeah, go ahead and change it.

00:08:57.035 --> 00:08:58.770
All done.

00:09:01.173 --> 00:09:03.842
I can't believe I'm showing you
this mess after 20 years.

00:09:05.344 --> 00:09:06.612
Hey, what are you talking about?

00:09:06.612 --> 00:09:07.846
Back in college,

00:09:07.846 --> 00:09:09.515
I carried your drunk self all the time.

00:09:09.515 --> 00:09:11.683
I've already seen
all kinds of things from you.

00:09:15.687 --> 00:09:16.555
Anyway,

00:09:17.256 --> 00:09:18.390
you can go first.

00:09:19.158 --> 00:09:20.159
You go first.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:22.094
Okay.

00:09:22.494 --> 00:09:23.395
Bye, then.

00:09:27.399 --> 00:09:28.667
Hey.

00:09:29.034 --> 00:09:31.003
If anything ever happens,

00:09:31.003 --> 00:09:32.371
call me right away, okay?

00:09:33.071 --> 00:09:33.906
I'm right there.

00:09:34.373 --> 00:09:35.207
Okay.

00:09:43.749 --> 00:09:44.716
Hello.

00:09:52.324 --> 00:09:56.195
(Sweet Home Shopping)

00:10:04.369 --> 00:10:05.270
Mi Sook.

00:10:07.339 --> 00:10:09.041
You got in too?

00:10:09.041 --> 00:10:10.142
Congrats.

00:10:10.142 --> 00:10:11.710
What? You got in too?

00:10:12.344 --> 00:10:13.078
Yeah.

00:10:20.519 --> 00:10:21.487
Hello.

00:10:21.854 --> 00:10:24.923
I'm Team Leader Kim Tae Jeong,

00:10:24.923 --> 00:10:27.926
and I'll be overseeing
your internship program.

00:10:27.926 --> 00:10:29.862
During the three-month course,

00:10:29.862 --> 00:10:31.630
you'll be paired with a mentor...

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:33.465
and receive one-on-one guidance.

00:10:33.465 --> 00:10:36.869
In the process,
you'll gain hands-on experience...

00:10:36.869 --> 00:10:37.970
with practical tasks
like marketing meetings,

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:40.639
partner meetings,
and live broadcast observations.

00:10:41.406 --> 00:10:43.008
Any questions so far?

00:10:44.343 --> 00:10:45.477
If not, we'll continue.

00:10:48.614 --> 00:10:50.983
I was so nervous
I didn't sleep a wink last night.

00:10:50.983 --> 00:10:52.284
I'm dead tired.

00:10:53.285 --> 00:10:54.586
I wonder who my mentor will be.

00:10:55.053 --> 00:10:57.156
I heard that in this industry,

00:10:57.156 --> 00:10:59.224
a bad mentor can be worse
than a mean senior nurse.

00:11:00.359 --> 00:11:02.594
Still, we've only done
live commerce before,

00:11:02.594 --> 00:11:04.163
so we really need help from a higher-up.

00:11:04.163 --> 00:11:06.131
We've got to make
the most of this opportunity.

00:11:08.634 --> 00:11:10.135
You've done live commerce?

00:11:10.369 --> 00:11:12.104
That's awesome.

00:11:12.104 --> 00:11:14.640
I tried to get into live commerce too,

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:15.641
but got rejected everywhere.

00:11:15.641 --> 00:11:18.610
Can I ask what kind of stream you did?

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:20.646
My gosh, Ms. Cho.
Hello!

00:11:20.646 --> 00:11:22.447
Min Joo, Seon Young.

00:11:22.447 --> 00:11:23.549
How have you been?

00:11:23.549 --> 00:11:25.717
We heard you were coming back.

00:11:26.351 --> 00:11:28.053
How does it feel to be back?

00:11:28.053 --> 00:11:31.056
It's not really a comeback.
I'm just an intern.

00:11:31.056 --> 00:11:33.759
Come on, Ms. Cho.
You're basically guaranteed a spot.

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:36.795
You're not like those
who've never done a main broadcast.

00:11:41.433 --> 00:11:45.070
I'm practically starting all over again.

00:11:46.071 --> 00:11:47.873
Anyway, enjoy your meal.

00:11:47.873 --> 00:11:49.441
Thanks. Bye.

00:11:56.882 --> 00:11:57.983
Actually...

00:11:57.983 --> 00:11:58.917
What was that?

00:11:59.351 --> 00:12:00.986
That felt kind of condescending.

00:12:01.854 --> 00:12:04.790
Do they think
we're all nobodies or something?

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:07.426
No, that's not what they meant.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.127
Forget it.

00:12:09.127 --> 00:12:11.363
You'd better keep this in mind.

00:12:11.563 --> 00:12:14.266
If you get special treatment
just because you used to work here,

00:12:14.867 --> 00:12:16.935
I'm not letting that slide.

00:12:30.916 --> 00:12:32.818
First day and it's already intense.

00:12:33.051 --> 00:12:34.186
How scary.

00:12:35.154 --> 00:12:36.788
Executive Director.

00:12:37.356 --> 00:12:40.859
I really don't want Cho Na Jeong
as my mentee.

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:43.996
I really can't stand her.

00:12:44.796 --> 00:12:47.299
We didn't get along back then either
and ended up having a huge fight.

00:12:47.299 --> 00:12:49.234
You know that, Executive Director.

00:12:50.469 --> 00:12:53.038
You don't get to pick your mentee here.

00:12:53.305 --> 00:12:54.740
You take what you're given.

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:56.408
Fine.

00:12:56.408 --> 00:12:59.244
Can I handle her however I want, then?

00:13:04.149 --> 00:13:05.050
Do what you want.

00:13:12.524 --> 00:13:14.693
If she acts all high and mighty,

00:13:14.693 --> 00:13:16.728
I'm going to drop her.

00:13:41.053 --> 00:13:41.854
What?

00:13:42.888 --> 00:13:44.289
Damn it.

00:14:02.608 --> 00:14:03.909
What happened?

00:14:03.909 --> 00:14:05.177
How'd it go?

00:14:05.177 --> 00:14:06.945
Did you and Sang Gyu
take things to the next level?

00:14:06.945 --> 00:14:07.746
Hey.

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:09.314
I think I'm pregnant.

00:14:09.648 --> 00:14:10.549
Already?

00:14:10.549 --> 00:14:12.050
No.

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:13.485
Not with Sang Gyu.

00:14:13.485 --> 00:14:14.786
What do you mean?

00:14:14.987 --> 00:14:18.423
I've been so out of it lately
that I didn't really pay attention,

00:14:18.757 --> 00:14:21.093
but I realized I haven't had my period
in three months.

00:14:21.093 --> 00:14:23.962
Around that time, I thought it was safe,
so we skipped condoms a few times.

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:26.965
Are you a teenager or what?

00:14:26.965 --> 00:14:29.168
What should I do?

00:14:29.168 --> 00:14:31.069
He's already checked out.

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:32.738
What about the test?

00:14:32.738 --> 00:14:33.872
Right, the test.

00:15:00.933 --> 00:15:01.867
What does it say?

00:15:02.601 --> 00:15:03.735
Tell me.

00:15:05.204 --> 00:15:06.171
One line.

00:15:07.005 --> 00:15:10.075
See? You scared me for nothing.

00:15:10.676 --> 00:15:12.144
Then why don't I have my period...

00:15:12.411 --> 00:15:13.345
for three whole months?

00:15:13.345 --> 00:15:15.247
Maybe your cycle's off.

00:15:15.247 --> 00:15:16.849
Just go get checked.

00:15:16.849 --> 00:15:18.717
And go to sleep, okay?

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.528
Premature menopause?

00:15:29.862 --> 00:15:32.464
Have your periods gotten lighter...

00:15:32.464 --> 00:15:35.734
or irregular lately?
Have you been feeling more irritable...

00:15:35.734 --> 00:15:37.803
or having trouble
controlling your emotions?

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:39.071
Well,

00:15:40.072 --> 00:15:41.840
maybe a bit.

00:15:42.574 --> 00:15:45.177
Your blood test results aren't great.

00:15:45.711 --> 00:15:49.181
See here, your AMH level is
practically zero.

00:15:50.182 --> 00:15:53.252
That means you've got
almost no viable follicles left...

00:15:53.252 --> 00:15:55.254
for ovulation.

00:15:55.254 --> 00:15:57.222
Is there any way to delay it?

00:15:58.657 --> 00:16:01.493
Not at this point, no.

00:16:16.542 --> 00:16:17.543
It's okay.

00:16:18.043 --> 00:16:20.946
It's not like I ever planned
on having kids anyway.

00:16:21.713 --> 00:16:23.949
Actually, not having periods
is kind of nice.

00:16:24.483 --> 00:16:26.118
You know how bad my cramps were.

00:16:27.186 --> 00:16:28.520
When they hit near a deadline,

00:16:29.922 --> 00:16:30.956
it was pure hell.

00:16:33.225 --> 00:16:35.594
Cheer up. I'm really fine.

00:16:56.648 --> 00:16:58.283
What did you want to say?

00:17:03.322 --> 00:17:06.124
Say it now. I go live soon.

00:17:06.124 --> 00:17:06.992
Okay.

00:17:08.293 --> 00:17:09.228
Ye Na.

00:17:09.795 --> 00:17:11.463
You might not want to do this.

00:17:11.463 --> 00:17:13.298
But I'll really work hard,

00:17:13.298 --> 00:17:14.466
so please help me out.

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:17.302
I know this must be uncomfortable for you.

00:17:18.237 --> 00:17:21.173
We hurt each other's feelings back then,

00:17:21.907 --> 00:17:24.309
so having me here as an intern
cannot be easy.

00:17:25.577 --> 00:17:29.014
But after six years away,

00:17:29.014 --> 00:17:32.050
I've forgotten everything
and feel completely lost.

00:17:33.952 --> 00:17:35.787
Just think of it as mentoring a junior,

00:17:36.088 --> 00:17:37.589
and guide me a little, will you?

00:17:44.296 --> 00:17:45.597
Shoot, what do we do?

00:17:46.198 --> 00:17:47.800
They said the demo model can't come.

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:48.567
What?

00:17:49.001 --> 00:17:49.835
Why not?

00:17:49.835 --> 00:17:51.703
She got into a minor car accident,

00:17:51.703 --> 00:17:52.871
and it'll take about two hours
to sort it out.

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:57.209
We're almost on air.
What are we supposed to do?

00:17:57.609 --> 00:17:58.944
Any backup model?

00:17:58.944 --> 00:18:00.445
Wasn't the last show a beauty segment?

00:18:00.445 --> 00:18:02.514
Yeah, but they already clocked out
and left the area.

00:18:03.182 --> 00:18:04.183
So without a demo,

00:18:04.183 --> 00:18:05.984
you expect me to handle
everything by myself?

00:18:07.219 --> 00:18:08.153
How about...

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:10.956
I try doing that?

00:18:10.956 --> 00:18:12.224
It's been a while,

00:18:12.224 --> 00:18:14.126
but I think I can manage
a simple demonstration.

00:18:21.266 --> 00:18:22.167
Would you really?

00:18:22.367 --> 00:18:25.137
Which product was it again exactly?

00:18:26.271 --> 00:18:27.072
Hair.

00:18:27.439 --> 00:18:28.507
A hair product. Okay.

00:18:29.575 --> 00:18:31.210
Then...

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:33.345
I'll prep a before look and jump right in.

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:02.908
What exactly...

00:19:03.609 --> 00:19:04.810
did you just do?

00:19:07.613 --> 00:19:08.680
Earlier,

00:19:09.414 --> 00:19:11.216
didn't you say it was a hair product?

00:19:11.216 --> 00:19:12.851
Me? When did I say that?

00:19:14.219 --> 00:19:15.220
Producer Kim.

00:19:15.687 --> 00:19:17.589
Did I say it was a hair product?

00:19:17.589 --> 00:19:18.657
What?

00:19:18.657 --> 00:19:20.159
Well...

00:19:20.159 --> 00:19:21.059
No.

00:19:22.161 --> 00:19:24.062
See? I can't even.

00:19:25.364 --> 00:19:28.000
You misheard it and now you're blaming us?

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:29.401
Just...

00:19:30.169 --> 00:19:32.371
admit it was your mistake.

00:19:34.139 --> 00:19:36.408

so just step aside.

is once a month,

00:20:42.241 --> 00:20:44.543

00:22:32.451 --> 00:22:34.052
Good.

00:22:34.052 --> 00:22:35.721
That's how it should be.

00:22:35.721 --> 00:22:37.356
You're not strong to begin with,

00:22:37.356 --> 00:22:39.992
so I was always worried
you'd wear yourself out.

00:22:39.992 --> 00:22:41.960
Late nights and dieting.

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:44.563
Those are the roots
of all illness for women.

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:48.600
Eat up, okay?

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:49.368
Yes.

00:22:52.004 --> 00:22:54.840
Is everything all right
with your marriage lately?

00:22:56.742 --> 00:22:57.810
Well, yes.

00:23:00.145 --> 00:23:01.847
I was walking around
the department store today...

00:23:02.181 --> 00:23:05.150
and found something
that suits you perfectly.

00:23:06.451 --> 00:23:08.086
Thank you, Mother.

00:23:08.654 --> 00:23:09.755
What is it?

00:23:09.755 --> 00:23:10.689
Open it.

00:23:10.956 --> 00:23:11.790
Come on.

00:23:23.202 --> 00:23:25.170
What do you think? Pretty, right?

00:23:26.405 --> 00:23:27.206
Yes.

00:23:27.573 --> 00:23:30.976
A woman, above all,
needs to keep her stomach warm.

00:23:31.276 --> 00:23:32.411
Last time I saw you,

00:23:32.411 --> 00:23:34.947
you were wearing panties
barely the size of your palm.

00:23:34.947 --> 00:23:37.115
That won't do.

00:23:45.057 --> 00:23:47.292
I took care of the broadcast.

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:50.729
As for you,
organize a list of the recent products...

00:23:50.729 --> 00:23:52.397
and make sure you're familiar with them.

00:23:52.931 --> 00:23:54.166
Sort them by category,

00:23:54.166 --> 00:23:56.535
and send it to me before you leave.

00:23:56.802 --> 00:23:58.170
But earlier you definitely told me...

00:23:58.170 --> 00:23:59.304
Is that really what matters right now?

00:23:59.805 --> 00:24:01.507
Was almost causing a disaster
not enough for you?

00:24:04.376 --> 00:24:05.177
Seriously?

00:24:13.485 --> 00:24:15.988
Tonight, there's a team dinner
with the executive director...

00:24:15.988 --> 00:24:18.190
and the other team.
Make sure you attend.

00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:19.224
A team dinner?

00:24:19.925 --> 00:24:22.161
Why? You can't come again?

00:24:23.595 --> 00:24:25.097
No.

00:24:32.037 --> 00:24:33.438
What are you saying?

00:24:33.739 --> 00:24:35.274
Suddenly,
there's no one to watch the kids?

00:24:35.274 --> 00:24:36.909
I asked our nanny,

00:24:36.909 --> 00:24:39.344
but her son-in-law and daughter
are visiting, so she can't.

00:24:39.344 --> 00:24:40.612
Honey.

00:24:40.612 --> 00:24:42.881
Can't we just ask your mom to take them?

00:24:42.881 --> 00:24:44.983
How can Mom handle three kids alone?

00:24:44.983 --> 00:24:47.319
But I can't cancel the meeting.

00:24:47.319 --> 00:24:48.787
Anyway, I can't today.

00:24:50.455 --> 00:24:51.824
I have to go. Sorry.

00:24:52.858 --> 00:24:54.726
Honey, you can't just leave.

00:24:54.726 --> 00:24:55.627
Honey...

00:25:03.802 --> 00:25:04.636
Hey.

00:25:05.304 --> 00:25:06.271
Hi, Mom.

00:25:06.572 --> 00:25:07.539
What is it?

00:25:07.539 --> 00:25:10.309
Tae Rin got hand, foot, and mouth disease
and couldn't go to kindergarten.

00:25:11.076 --> 00:25:12.978
Your sister-in-law made such a fuss.

00:25:13.545 --> 00:25:15.214
I'm worn out.

00:25:15.214 --> 00:25:17.149
I see.

00:25:17.149 --> 00:25:19.084
How's work?

00:25:19.084 --> 00:25:20.419
It's fine.

00:25:22.888 --> 00:25:25.157
Your sister-in-law's calling again.

00:25:25.157 --> 00:25:25.958
I'll hang up.

00:25:25.958 --> 00:25:27.559
Okay, Mom. I'll call you back.

00:25:34.967 --> 00:25:35.901
(Min Woo's Mom, Na Jeong)

00:25:36.668 --> 00:25:37.736
Yes, Na Jeong?

00:25:37.936 --> 00:25:38.904
Jin Hee.

00:25:41.406 --> 00:25:42.274
I have...

00:25:43.375 --> 00:25:45.043
a favor to ask.

00:25:45.611 --> 00:25:46.411
Ask.

00:25:48.814 --> 00:25:52.284
I said it was okay.
You really didn't have to bother.

00:25:52.284 --> 00:25:54.153
I could've just taken the bus.

00:25:54.153 --> 00:25:55.154
Not at all.

00:25:55.154 --> 00:25:57.589
How could you carry
all this heavy stuff alone, Mother?

00:25:59.491 --> 00:26:01.026
Would you like to come in for a bit?

00:26:01.026 --> 00:26:03.462
No, that's okay.
I should go before Sang Min gets home.

00:26:03.462 --> 00:26:05.197
Wait a minute.

00:26:05.197 --> 00:26:08.400
I've got something special for you.

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:09.768
Hold on.

00:26:31.256 --> 00:26:32.925
Joo Young.

00:26:37.362 --> 00:26:38.797
Here.

00:26:40.566 --> 00:26:42.434
I visited a monk I know,

00:26:42.434 --> 00:26:44.403
and he wrote this for you.

00:26:44.837 --> 00:26:47.005
He said your energy seemed really low.

00:26:47.739 --> 00:26:49.575
I've been feeling so down lately.

00:26:51.176 --> 00:26:53.879
Sometimes I wonder what you did
in a past life to end up without children.

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:57.483
Just thinking about it
makes my chest ache at night.

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:03.155
You're not offended, are you?

00:27:03.489 --> 00:27:05.157
No, Mother. Of course not.

00:27:05.858 --> 00:27:06.692
Good.

00:27:07.092 --> 00:27:09.027
When I go to stay in Jeju for a month,

00:27:09.027 --> 00:27:11.530
could you remind Sang Min
to water my plants?

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:13.098
Yes.

00:27:13.565 --> 00:27:15.567
Thanks.
I'm not walking you all the way out.

00:27:16.435 --> 00:27:17.169
Bye.

00:27:17.169 --> 00:27:18.504
I'll get going.

00:27:39.024 --> 00:27:42.027
(Oh Sang *)

00:27:54.873 --> 00:27:55.741
Seriously?

00:27:56.675 --> 00:27:57.910
Why is it that she never once thinks...

00:27:57.910 --> 00:28:00.379
any of this might be her son's fault?

00:28:03.415 --> 00:28:04.716
Because he's afraid I'll tell him off,

00:28:04.716 --> 00:28:06.485
he got his things delivered
to his parents' house?

00:28:07.252 --> 00:28:09.054
What did he buy this time?

00:28:31.743 --> 00:28:33.779
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:28:50.462 --> 00:28:51.797
How much longer do I have to wait?

00:28:51.797 --> 00:28:53.332
I'm not quite finished yet.

00:28:53.332 --> 00:28:54.833
Could you wait just a bit longer?

00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:00.072
All right then.

00:29:00.072 --> 00:29:02.541
Finish it up and email it to me.

00:29:02.841 --> 00:29:03.709
Sure.

00:29:13.619 --> 00:29:14.720
By the way,

00:29:15.154 --> 00:29:16.488
aren't you hungry?

00:29:17.156 --> 00:29:18.056
Well...

00:29:18.056 --> 00:29:21.160
Since the team dinner's
at a Korean BBQ place,

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:23.262
it'd be a shame to spoil your appetite.

00:29:23.695 --> 00:29:25.230
See you in a bit.

00:29:44.416 --> 00:29:46.852
Hey, why do you keep using my cup?

00:29:46.852 --> 00:29:49.221
The red one's mine.

00:29:50.989 --> 00:29:52.324
Ms. Hwang.

00:29:52.324 --> 00:29:53.325
Yes?

00:29:53.325 --> 00:29:56.829
She keeps telling me
not to touch anything.

00:29:57.262 --> 00:29:58.697
Yu Ah Young.

00:29:58.697 --> 00:30:00.232
That's not nice.

00:30:00.232 --> 00:30:02.734
He's a guest.
Let him borrow your cup.

00:30:02.734 --> 00:30:06.271
Why are you always taking his side
instead of mine, Mom?

00:30:06.805 --> 00:30:07.940
I hate you, Mom.

00:30:09.908 --> 00:30:13.545
Why is my princess upset again?

00:30:13.846 --> 00:30:15.380
You'll listen to Mommy, right?

00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:16.482
Okay.

00:30:17.282 --> 00:30:18.383
Good girl.

00:30:21.587 --> 00:30:22.554
Hey.

00:30:23.789 --> 00:30:25.324
Let's eat.

00:30:26.758 --> 00:30:27.826
When are they going home?

00:30:30.496 --> 00:30:32.564
Their mom's busy today.

00:30:37.136 --> 00:30:38.036
What?

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:40.439
Did you forget I'm in exam week, Mom?

00:30:40.672 --> 00:30:42.074
How could you say
you'd take care of all those kids...

00:30:44.543 --> 00:30:45.511
for her?

00:30:46.879 --> 00:30:49.081
That's enough. Eat your dinner.

00:30:50.382 --> 00:30:51.750
I'm not eating with them.

00:30:52.851 --> 00:30:54.052
Bring mine to my room.

00:30:56.188 --> 00:30:57.890
Yu Bo Hyeon.

00:30:59.424 --> 00:31:01.360
We're so grateful.

00:31:06.865 --> 00:31:07.866
Sorry.

00:31:07.866 --> 00:31:09.334
- You're here.
- Yes.

00:31:09.334 --> 00:31:10.402
- Sit.
- Yes.

00:31:11.069 --> 00:31:11.904
Mr. Kim.

00:31:12.237 --> 00:31:14.339
This young lady here.

00:31:15.507 --> 00:31:16.675
She used to be...

00:31:17.109 --> 00:31:20.479
a promising talent I had high hopes for.

00:31:21.613 --> 00:31:22.848
But then she had kids,

00:31:23.382 --> 00:31:25.584
and totally let me down.

00:31:26.885 --> 00:31:28.487
- Hey, Cho Na Jeong.
- Yes, ma'am.

00:31:28.487 --> 00:31:29.922
You know,

00:31:29.922 --> 00:31:31.857
as a fellow working mom,

00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:35.194
I really wanted you to do well.

00:31:35.194 --> 00:31:36.662
That's why I was harder on you.

00:31:38.363 --> 00:31:39.198
But then,

00:31:39.698 --> 00:31:41.467
this one here...

00:31:41.467 --> 00:31:43.635
couldn't handle it and quit.

00:31:45.304 --> 00:31:46.772
Did you quit because of me?

00:31:46.772 --> 00:31:48.373
No, Executive Director.

00:31:48.373 --> 00:31:49.341
Then why did you quit?

00:31:49.908 --> 00:31:52.211
I'm sorry. I lacked persistence.

00:31:53.345 --> 00:31:54.713
You'll do better this time, right?

00:31:54.913 --> 00:31:56.381
Yes, I'll do my best.

00:31:59.618 --> 00:32:00.953
Good. Okay.

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:04.490
Then let's go celebrate and get fired up.

00:32:04.756 --> 00:32:07.593
Mr. Kim, does karaoke sound good?

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:10.095
Of course.

00:32:10.095 --> 00:32:12.664
Let's go.

00:32:13.899 --> 00:32:15.067
Let's go.

00:32:26.311 --> 00:32:28.247
As expected of Mr. Kim.

00:32:31.817 --> 00:32:35.454
Yesterday

00:32:35.454 --> 00:32:39.057
Today

00:32:39.057 --> 00:32:41.393
And tomorrow

00:32:41.393 --> 00:32:45.297
I just want to keep hearing those words

00:32:46.298 --> 00:32:49.001
You like me

00:32:49.001 --> 00:32:49.968
Like me

00:32:49.968 --> 00:32:52.571
I like you

00:32:52.571 --> 00:32:53.639
Like you

00:32:53.639 --> 00:32:56.241
You like me

00:32:56.241 --> 00:32:57.209
Like me

00:32:57.209 --> 00:33:00.379
I like you

00:33:09.688 --> 00:33:12.424
Everyone.

00:33:12.958 --> 00:33:14.459
At this point,

00:33:14.793 --> 00:33:17.830
let's have Na Jeong sing one.

00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:19.331
Give her a hand.

00:33:23.135 --> 00:33:26.004
Now it's time to smile again

00:33:26.638 --> 00:33:30.108
This is a happy moment, happy days

00:33:30.108 --> 00:33:32.277
Straighten your shoulders

00:33:32.277 --> 00:33:35.747
Erase all the hardships

00:33:35.747 --> 00:33:37.015
In the world

00:33:37.015 --> 00:33:40.486
Forget your sorrow, never cry

00:33:40.486 --> 00:33:43.922
Under the blazing sun, sunny days

00:33:43.922 --> 00:33:48.026
May only good things fill your life

00:33:48.026 --> 00:33:50.095
That's all you need to wish for

00:34:00.272 --> 00:34:02.040
Hype Na Jeong.

00:34:03.575 --> 00:34:04.743
I've got high hopes for you.

00:34:06.211 --> 00:34:07.880
Since it took so much
for you to come back,

00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:10.449
you'll have to work twice,
even three times harder than others.

00:34:12.084 --> 00:34:13.285
Okay, let's head back.

00:34:13.285 --> 00:34:14.086
Executive Director.

00:34:14.086 --> 00:34:15.988
Yeah, what is it?

00:34:24.263 --> 00:34:25.197
You have to go?

00:34:26.965 --> 00:34:28.300
I'm sorry.

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:30.102
My schedule got a bit mixed up,
so I should.

00:34:40.546 --> 00:34:41.446
You're leaving already?

00:34:43.782 --> 00:34:44.716
Yeah.

00:34:48.554 --> 00:34:49.788
Then go ahead.

00:34:50.722 --> 00:34:54.626
If she can't even stay
until the end of a team dinner,

00:34:54.626 --> 00:34:55.694
why did she bother coming back to work?

00:35:16.715 --> 00:35:18.917
Why do I have to be sent
to the study room?

00:35:18.917 --> 00:35:21.220
If I blow this exam,
are you going to take responsibility?

00:35:21.987 --> 00:35:24.156
Why are you so touchy?

00:35:24.156 --> 00:35:26.992
If my friend's busy, I can watch her kids.

00:35:27.392 --> 00:35:29.761
Your daughter's in exam season,
and your friend comes first?

00:35:30.262 --> 00:35:32.865
If she has to dump her kids at someone
else's place, then she shouldn't work.

00:35:32.865 --> 00:35:34.399
She's so selfish.

00:35:37.202 --> 00:35:39.004
Do you think you can just say
whatever you want?

00:35:44.643 --> 00:35:45.844
Bo Hyeon.

00:35:59.925 --> 00:36:01.293
I'm sorry, Na Jeong.

00:36:02.794 --> 00:36:05.330
Bo Hyeon's going through
puberty these days,

00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:06.899
and she argues about everything.

00:36:07.966 --> 00:36:08.801
No.

00:36:09.835 --> 00:36:11.203
I'm the one who should apologize.

00:36:12.638 --> 00:36:13.806
I was being clueless.

00:36:14.206 --> 00:36:16.074
I didn't even know
it was exam week for Bo Hyeon.

00:36:16.275 --> 00:36:18.410
Hey, don't worry about it.

00:36:18.844 --> 00:36:20.679
She doesn't study anyway,

00:36:20.679 --> 00:36:22.981
and she just found the perfect excuse,
that's all.

00:36:28.587 --> 00:36:30.522
You haven't even had dinner yet?

00:36:31.523 --> 00:36:32.558
I have.

00:36:33.392 --> 00:36:34.927
Hey, eat before you go.

00:36:34.927 --> 00:36:36.395
No, Jin Hee. I'm not hungry.

00:36:36.395 --> 00:36:39.331
I made too much curry.
If it's left, I'll have to throw it out.

00:36:39.331 --> 00:36:41.166
Consider this
helping me not to waste food.

00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:00.319
It must be tough for you.

00:37:10.596 --> 00:37:13.499
Did you buy a new dish?

00:37:14.366 --> 00:37:15.534
I haven't seen this before.

00:37:25.744 --> 00:37:26.712
Na Jeong.

00:37:37.656 --> 00:37:38.857
Still, Na Jeong,

00:37:39.725 --> 00:37:41.827
hang in there as long as you can.

00:37:43.495 --> 00:37:46.198
If you hold out a bit longer
and the kids get older,

00:37:47.065 --> 00:37:49.601
you'll be glad you stuck it out
when you look back.

00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:54.807
You know, when I had Bo Hyeon
and quit my job,

00:37:55.507 --> 00:37:58.110
it was really hard.

00:37:59.144 --> 00:38:01.580
But do you know what the hardest part was?

00:38:05.117 --> 00:38:07.553
Feeling pushed out of society.

00:38:09.288 --> 00:38:11.423
That was what I couldn't stand.

00:38:18.697 --> 00:38:21.800
But you grabbed the opportunity
before it was too late.

00:38:23.268 --> 00:38:25.537
It's such a precious opportunity.

00:38:25.737 --> 00:38:26.672
So hold on.

00:38:27.072 --> 00:38:28.907
Hold on as long as you can.

00:38:29.341 --> 00:38:33.745
I didn't begrudgingly watch
Min Woo and Min Jun, you know.

00:38:33.745 --> 00:38:37.349
In a way, you're living out my dream.

00:38:37.349 --> 00:38:38.217
Okay?

00:38:38.217 --> 00:38:41.687
So how could I not root for you?

00:38:43.589 --> 00:38:45.157
And the Cho Na Jeong I know...

00:38:45.624 --> 00:38:48.627
isn't someone who crumbles
just because of something like this.

00:38:49.895 --> 00:38:51.330
Chin up, Cho Na Jeong.

00:38:56.034 --> 00:38:57.569
Eat up.

00:38:57.569 --> 00:38:59.438
It won't taste good once it's cold.

00:39:03.509 --> 00:39:04.643
Come on, eat up.

00:39:08.914 --> 00:39:09.948
Thanks, Jin Hee.

(Sweet Home Shopping)

00:40:22.421 --> 00:40:23.288
Ye Na.

00:40:24.923 --> 00:40:26.391
Did you get home okay last night?

00:40:26.391 --> 00:40:27.526
It ran really late, didn't it?

00:40:28.227 --> 00:40:29.394
Did you prep for the meeting?

00:40:29.394 --> 00:40:31.263
Of course. Let's go.

00:40:34.633 --> 00:40:35.501
Here.

00:40:38.837 --> 00:40:40.272
What's this?

00:40:40.272 --> 00:40:42.241
You got me a latte? That's fattening.

00:40:43.442 --> 00:40:46.745
Haven't you noticed
I only drink regular coffee?

00:40:46.745 --> 00:40:47.913
Sorry.

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:51.316
You haven't been eating much lately,

00:40:51.316 --> 00:40:53.085
so I was worried your stomach would hurt.
I'll bring you another drink.

00:40:53.085 --> 00:40:54.052
It's fine.

00:40:56.155 --> 00:40:58.223
Have you thought of any ideas?

00:40:59.091 --> 00:41:01.360
You must've gotten
a lot of input while at home.

00:41:01.994 --> 00:41:03.862
While I was home,

00:41:03.862 --> 00:41:05.898
there was a product I looked into.

00:41:05.898 --> 00:41:07.399
An automatic stationary bike.

00:41:07.666 --> 00:41:09.935
You just rest your feet on the pedals...

00:41:09.935 --> 00:41:11.136
and it moves on its own.

00:41:11.136 --> 00:41:13.172
Who would buy that?

00:41:13.772 --> 00:41:15.974
If you use an automatic bike,

00:41:15.974 --> 00:41:17.442
how is that a workout?

00:41:17.442 --> 00:41:19.211
Hear me out first.

00:41:19.211 --> 00:41:21.780
My mom had knee surgery a few years ago,

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:24.183
and did rehab for a while.

00:41:24.183 --> 00:41:27.386
For seniors with low strength,
it's really useful.

00:41:27.386 --> 00:41:30.556
Our home shopping's main customers
are older adults.

00:41:30.556 --> 00:41:31.456
I think...

00:41:31.456 --> 00:41:32.758
this is not impressive.

00:41:33.025 --> 00:41:36.562
The Executive Director said
we should lower our target age.

00:41:37.262 --> 00:41:40.265
We'd be better off with luxury bags,
sunglasses, and things like that.

00:41:40.265 --> 00:41:42.601
No, sunglasses are a no-go.

00:41:43.869 --> 00:41:44.803
Why?

00:41:44.803 --> 00:41:46.538
No matter how nice they are,

00:41:46.538 --> 00:41:49.575
you can't tell if they suit you
without trying them on.

00:41:49.575 --> 00:41:51.877
If returns pour in, that's just risk.

00:41:52.711 --> 00:41:54.213
That's your view, Na Jeong.

00:41:54.213 --> 00:41:56.014
That's not the trend these days.

00:41:56.482 --> 00:41:58.817
You don't have any useful ideas.

00:42:10.128 --> 00:42:11.063
All right.

00:42:11.797 --> 00:42:13.966
Let's wrap up the monthly meeting here.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.335
And now,

00:42:16.635 --> 00:42:19.271
let me hear items you think
would be good...

00:42:19.271 --> 00:42:20.272
to launch on our channel.

00:42:22.941 --> 00:42:24.243
Speak up, everyone.

00:42:26.178 --> 00:42:28.013
On first-mover products,

00:42:28.013 --> 00:42:30.349
reports say we're far behind
our competitors.

00:42:30.883 --> 00:42:33.485
We all need to take ownership
and work together to survive.

00:42:36.488 --> 00:42:37.456
Executive Director.

00:42:37.689 --> 00:42:40.058
May my mentee present something?

00:42:41.093 --> 00:42:41.960
Who's your mentee?

00:42:42.361 --> 00:42:43.128
Me.

00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:47.332
I'm Yang Mi Sook.

00:42:48.834 --> 00:42:49.768
Go ahead.

00:42:50.035 --> 00:42:52.171
I may not know much else,

00:42:52.171 --> 00:42:55.607
but I'm pretty savvy with luxury,
so here's my take.

00:42:55.874 --> 00:42:57.543
This season,

00:42:57.543 --> 00:42:59.611
Hercules released a new sunglasses model.

00:43:00.012 --> 00:43:01.280
- Put it up.
- Yes.

00:43:03.081 --> 00:43:03.982
Nice.

00:43:04.850 --> 00:43:06.385
Really sleek, right?

00:43:06.985 --> 00:43:09.955
It sold out completely
as soon as it dropped.

00:43:10.722 --> 00:43:13.091
Before another home shopping channel
gets exclusivity,

00:43:13.091 --> 00:43:16.028
how about we lock it in first?

00:43:16.662 --> 00:43:17.629
I am...

00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:19.798
against it.

00:43:21.033 --> 00:43:23.535
No matter how luxurious
and pretty sunglasses are,

00:43:23.535 --> 00:43:24.636
without trying them on,

00:43:24.636 --> 00:43:26.839
you cannot tell...

00:43:26.839 --> 00:43:28.173
if they suit you.

00:43:28.841 --> 00:43:31.043
If customers buy them just because
they're pretty and the return rate rises,

00:43:31.243 --> 00:43:32.678
that could pose a serious risk.

00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:36.915
Instead, I've got a product...

00:43:36.915 --> 00:43:38.917
I have a strong hunch about.

00:43:39.818 --> 00:43:41.954
An automatic stationary bike.

00:43:45.557 --> 00:43:46.358
Show us.

00:43:48.594 --> 00:43:50.395
You rest your feet on the pedals,

00:43:50.395 --> 00:43:52.798
and it moves them automatically.

00:43:52.798 --> 00:43:53.699
Automatically?

00:43:54.533 --> 00:43:55.367
I'm not sure.

00:43:55.734 --> 00:43:57.503
Who would buy a bike
that doesn't even require working out?

00:43:58.937 --> 00:44:01.073
Most seniors who've had knee surgery...

00:44:01.073 --> 00:44:02.241
receive rehabilitation therapy...

00:44:02.241 --> 00:44:04.309
that moves the legs for them...

00:44:04.309 --> 00:44:06.178
after the procedure.

00:44:06.178 --> 00:44:09.014
And they know how effective it is.

00:44:10.015 --> 00:44:13.051
As you know,
older customers' buying power

00:44:13.051 --> 00:44:14.253
in home shopping is no joke.

00:44:17.089 --> 00:44:19.158
Okay, fair point.

00:44:19.892 --> 00:44:21.627
Mr. Choi, reach out to the vendor.

00:44:22.928 --> 00:44:25.030
And like Ms. Song,

00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:26.498
don't limit yourselves
to your lane, everyone.

00:44:26.498 --> 00:44:29.101
If you've got good items, speak up.

00:44:29.101 --> 00:44:30.235
Yes, understood.

00:44:37.876 --> 00:44:38.911
Hey.

00:44:38.911 --> 00:44:40.846
Don't you think that was too much?

00:44:40.846 --> 00:44:43.348
The automatic stationary bike was my idea.

00:44:43.348 --> 00:44:44.650
Why did you talk like it was yours?

00:44:45.117 --> 00:44:46.885
What are you saying?

00:44:46.885 --> 00:44:48.587
Are you calling me a thief?

00:44:48.954 --> 00:44:51.590
What's so great
about some little idea from an intern?

00:44:51.924 --> 00:44:54.593
And it was the team's idea,
not yours alone.

00:44:54.593 --> 00:44:56.995
What? "Some little idea?"

00:44:56.995 --> 00:44:59.331
Can you even come up with one yourself?

00:44:59.698 --> 00:45:00.833
What did you just say?

00:45:01.667 --> 00:45:02.901
I knew it.

00:45:02.901 --> 00:45:05.137
Weren't you the one
who asked me to help you out?

00:45:05.137 --> 00:45:06.939
I'm not letting this slide.

00:45:06.939 --> 00:45:09.508
I'll mark you for insubordination
in the mentee review,

00:45:09.508 --> 00:45:10.609
so get ready to be fired.

00:45:11.944 --> 00:45:13.412
And you think I'll just sit still?

00:45:13.912 --> 00:45:15.981
Run your filthy mouth one more time,

00:45:15.981 --> 00:45:18.350
and you'll be reported
for workplace bullying.

00:45:19.351 --> 00:45:21.653
And about when you lied to me
that it was a hair product...

00:45:21.653 --> 00:45:23.589
to dump it on me.

00:45:24.189 --> 00:45:25.958
You think I didn't notice?

00:45:30.529 --> 00:45:31.697
She's out of her mind.

00:45:31.697 --> 00:45:33.832
She's crazy!

00:45:37.136 --> 00:45:38.003
Song Ye Na.

00:45:38.804 --> 00:45:41.206
You dare poke the bear?

00:45:42.174 --> 00:45:43.876
You're dead now.

00:45:44.243 --> 00:45:45.577
- Mr. Choi.
- Yes?

00:45:46.812 --> 00:45:48.780
How are we supposed to sell those?

00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:51.717
We can't even swap in
something else as a decoy.

00:45:53.886 --> 00:45:54.987
So,

00:45:54.987 --> 00:45:56.822
how ripe are the apples right now?

00:45:57.856 --> 00:45:59.024
They're still green.

00:45:59.224 --> 00:46:01.960
We scheduled the broadcast
to align with the shipment,

00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:02.961
but because of the abnormal
weather...

00:46:02.961 --> 00:46:05.130
Then what do you want us to do?

00:46:05.130 --> 00:46:07.499
Go live from a studio
with nothing to show?

00:46:07.499 --> 00:46:10.435
Just say
it's a "pre-order, ships later" product?

00:46:10.435 --> 00:46:13.305
How will we make them order?

00:46:13.305 --> 00:46:14.139
Producer Kim.

00:46:14.373 --> 00:46:15.507
How about this?

00:46:15.741 --> 00:46:18.510
We do the broadcast from the orchard.

00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:20.813
Then we don't need
to switch to another product,

00:46:20.813 --> 00:46:22.915
and it will also look pretty convincing.

00:46:22.915 --> 00:46:24.416
We can stress...

00:46:24.416 --> 00:46:27.152
that we'll ship fresh, in-season fruit
right after harvest, building trust.

00:46:27.352 --> 00:46:28.520
That sounds good.

00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:29.688
What do you think?
What do you think, Producer Choi?

00:46:30.455 --> 00:46:31.957
Fresh, in-season fruit.

00:46:31.957 --> 00:46:33.692
That's actually not a bad idea.

00:46:33.692 --> 00:46:34.593
Right?

00:46:34.593 --> 00:46:37.262
What's good about it?

00:46:37.262 --> 00:46:39.264
You want us to go
all the way out of town just for that?

00:46:39.565 --> 00:46:42.267
No way. Find another option.

00:46:43.235 --> 00:46:46.405
Then do you have a better idea?

00:46:46.805 --> 00:46:48.974
Right now, that seems like our best shot.

00:46:48.974 --> 00:46:51.543
Yeah. We don't really have
an alternative at the moment.

00:46:51.944 --> 00:46:54.480
Or do you have any?

00:46:56.949 --> 00:47:00.219
I'm trying to think of one.

00:47:00.219 --> 00:47:01.420
We can figure it out later.

00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:03.722
Later? We don't have time for later.

00:47:03.722 --> 00:47:05.357
Let's just go there and do it.

00:47:05.357 --> 00:47:07.693
Mr. Choi, coordinate the schedule
with the supplier and let me know.

00:47:07.693 --> 00:47:08.961
Yes, sir.

00:47:08.961 --> 00:47:10.529
Fresh, in-season fruit.

00:47:10.729 --> 00:47:11.597
Good idea.

00:47:12.264 --> 00:47:13.265
All right, then.

00:47:13.265 --> 00:47:15.100
Fresh, in-season fruit.

00:47:17.302 --> 00:47:18.170
Damn it.

00:47:28.814 --> 00:47:30.949
I need to review the spec sheet,

00:47:30.949 --> 00:47:32.484
so drive carefully, okay?

00:47:32.851 --> 00:47:33.685
Sure.

00:47:34.353 --> 00:47:36.321
What am I, her chauffeur or what?

00:47:36.588 --> 00:47:37.756
Why make me drive her around?

00:47:40.359 --> 00:47:42.427
By the way, did you spray perfume?

00:47:42.828 --> 00:47:43.662
Ms. Song?

00:47:46.798 --> 00:47:48.133
That's a bit concerning.

00:47:49.268 --> 00:47:50.569
What are you to be concerned about me?

00:47:51.570 --> 00:47:54.206
Intern Cho, instead of meddling
in others' business,

00:47:54.206 --> 00:47:56.942
maybe focus on doing
your own job properly.

00:47:58.911 --> 00:47:59.778
Okay.

00:48:19.264 --> 00:48:20.098
(Mungyeong Apples)

00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:26.271
All done.

00:48:28.674 --> 00:48:30.876
Are you staying here?

00:48:30.876 --> 00:48:32.377
It's too hot outside.

00:48:32.377 --> 00:48:33.512
Call me when we're on standby.

00:48:33.812 --> 00:48:34.613
Okay.

00:48:35.781 --> 00:48:37.649
You fool.

00:48:37.649 --> 00:48:40.152
How can a show host plan to broadcast
without checking the site herself?

00:48:51.763 --> 00:48:52.764
What are you eating?

00:48:53.632 --> 00:48:54.700
Something to stay fit?

00:48:55.267 --> 00:48:56.802
Why? You want one too?

00:48:57.970 --> 00:48:59.171
No thanks.

00:48:59.171 --> 00:49:01.440
You're the one who needs to lose weight
more than I do, Intern Cho.

00:49:02.808 --> 00:49:05.744
Well, at least that's smarter
than starving yourself.

00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:08.814
I know, right?

00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:02.901
Where's the bathroom?

00:50:03.669 --> 00:50:04.603
Over there.

00:50:21.253 --> 00:50:23.222
Seriously?

00:52:33.485 --> 00:52:35.754
My face feels like it's burning.

00:52:38.857 --> 00:52:40.425
Is that 911? There's...

00:52:40.993 --> 00:52:42.261
My goodness.

00:52:43.328 --> 00:52:45.764
They said the ambulance took another route
and can't come here.

00:52:56.842 --> 00:52:59.444
What do I do? My face!

00:52:59.444 --> 00:53:00.445
Am I going to die?

00:53:00.445 --> 00:53:02.047
What if I have anaphylaxis?

00:53:02.047 --> 00:53:04.783
What if I get cut from the show?

00:53:04.783 --> 00:53:06.385
- Na Jeong.
- Yes?

00:53:06.385 --> 00:53:08.453
I think I'm going to pass out.

00:53:08.453 --> 00:53:10.122
Na Jeong, I'm going to faint.

00:53:10.122 --> 00:53:11.723
I can't...

00:53:11.723 --> 00:53:13.492
No.

00:53:13.492 --> 00:53:14.760
Song Ye Na, stay with me.

00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:16.995
Don't pass out.
We're almost at the hospital.

00:53:17.729 --> 00:53:19.631
You shouldn't have put on perfume.

00:53:19.631 --> 00:53:21.333
No. Come on.

00:53:21.333 --> 00:53:23.035
Stay with me.

00:53:23.869 --> 00:53:24.937
Please.

00:53:26.972 --> 00:53:28.140
Excuse me.

00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:29.308
Please.

00:53:29.308 --> 00:53:30.776
This is an emergency.
She was stung by bees.

00:53:33.345 --> 00:53:35.647
Hey, where are you going?

00:53:36.215 --> 00:53:38.083
What about the broadcast?
I have to host.

00:53:38.951 --> 00:53:40.385
Are you insane?

00:53:40.385 --> 00:53:41.820
Didn't you say
you might have ana-something?

00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:42.988
I won't. I have to go.

00:53:43.755 --> 00:53:44.656
Seriously?

00:53:45.657 --> 00:53:46.992
Give me the car key.

00:53:46.992 --> 00:53:47.826
No way.

00:53:47.826 --> 00:53:49.595
You're in no shape to go on air right now.

00:53:49.595 --> 00:53:50.996
You need treatment first.

00:53:50.996 --> 00:53:53.699
What good is treatment if I miss the show?
If I blow this, I'll be fired.

00:53:55.067 --> 00:53:57.035
I'm already on thin ice.

00:53:57.035 --> 00:53:59.071
If I ruin this broadcast,
it's over for me.

00:54:00.439 --> 00:54:02.307
Do you know how hard I worked to get here?

00:54:02.808 --> 00:54:05.210
You have a husband and kids,

00:54:05.210 --> 00:54:07.212
but I've got nothing but my job.

00:54:10.649 --> 00:54:13.352
I can't breathe.

00:54:14.453 --> 00:54:15.854
I didn't think I'd have ana...

00:54:16.455 --> 00:54:18.023
Ye Na, no.

00:54:18.023 --> 00:54:18.957
Over here!

00:54:20.792 --> 00:54:21.660
Ye Na.

00:54:34.439 --> 00:54:36.008
Thank you.

00:54:44.917 --> 00:54:45.784
Yes, Executive Director?

00:54:45.784 --> 00:54:47.019
Cho Na Jeong, where are you right now?

00:54:47.019 --> 00:54:49.221
I'm at the hospital.
Ye Na seems a bit better and...

00:54:49.221 --> 00:54:50.722
Then get to the orchard, now.

00:54:51.890 --> 00:54:53.692
You're the only one
who can go on air right now.

00:54:53.692 --> 00:54:54.793
So you'll have to do it.

00:54:54.793 --> 00:54:55.661
Can you handle it?

00:54:56.528 --> 00:54:58.030
Me?

00:54:58.330 --> 00:55:00.566
Did you review
the product spec sheet or not?

00:55:01.633 --> 00:55:03.435
Tell me now. We don't have time.

00:55:03.435 --> 00:55:04.470
Yes, I did.

00:55:05.637 --> 00:55:07.372
I also checked out the site myself, but...

00:55:07.372 --> 00:55:08.674
Good. Then get there right away.

00:55:09.775 --> 00:55:11.109
If you mess this up,

00:55:11.109 --> 00:55:12.945
me, Kim Tae Jeong, Song Ye Na,

00:55:12.945 --> 00:55:14.980
and you too, are all finished.

00:55:14.980 --> 00:55:15.781
Do you hear me?

00:55:18.217 --> 00:55:19.051
Yes, Executive Director.

00:56:00.659 --> 00:56:01.426
Hey.

00:56:01.426 --> 00:56:03.896
I reviewed the product spec sheet.
Price 32.9 dollars,

00:56:03.896 --> 00:56:06.565
packaged with air pockets,
sugar level 14 Brix or higher.

00:56:06.565 --> 00:56:07.332
Yes.

00:56:07.866 --> 00:56:09.234
Average weight 250 grams,

00:56:09.234 --> 00:56:10.502
this season's first harvest
of fresh apples,

00:56:10.502 --> 00:56:11.937
comes with 20 packs of apple juice
as a gift,

00:56:11.937 --> 00:56:13.071
which are available for purchase too.

00:56:13.071 --> 00:56:13.972
That's right.

00:56:13.972 --> 00:56:15.674
- Ho Dol, let's get ready.
- Yes.

00:56:46.538 --> 00:56:51.443
(Fresh local food is coming.)

00:56:53.278 --> 00:56:56.048
(100 percent fresh Korean produce)

00:56:56.048 --> 00:56:57.549
(Fresh local food is coming.)

00:57:05.324 --> 00:57:06.625
Please excuse me.

00:57:06.625 --> 00:57:07.359
Sorry.

00:57:08.694 --> 00:57:09.628
Excuse me.

00:57:10.963 --> 00:57:12.030
Broadcast in ten seconds.

00:57:22.474 --> 00:57:23.275
Five seconds.

00:57:25.677 --> 00:57:26.478
Four.

00:57:28.814 --> 00:57:29.648
Three.

00:57:33.118 --> 00:57:33.886
Two.

00:57:36.488 --> 00:57:37.322
One.

00:57:38.257 --> 00:57:39.091
Cue!

00:57:43.829 --> 00:57:45.364
Hello, dear customers.

00:57:45.364 --> 00:57:47.633
I'm your shopping host, Cho Na Jeong.

00:57:47.633 --> 00:57:51.203
Today, we're broadcasting
under this clear, beautiful sky...

00:57:51.203 --> 00:57:53.939
from an apple orchard in Mungyeong.

00:57:53.939 --> 00:57:55.674
Everyone.

00:57:55.674 --> 00:57:56.875
Do you see this?

00:57:56.875 --> 00:57:59.845
Apples hanging in clusters
on every branch.

00:57:59.845 --> 00:58:01.346
We wanted to bring...

00:58:01.346 --> 00:58:03.415
this fresh scenery straight to you,

00:58:03.415 --> 00:58:04.850
so here we are.

00:58:04.850 --> 00:58:08.220
These apples you're looking at
are ripening beautifully.

00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:10.222
Getting ready for peak sweetness,

00:58:10.222 --> 00:58:12.558
getting ready for deeper color.

00:58:12.558 --> 00:58:13.358
Now,

00:58:14.026 --> 00:58:17.996
you might think apples are all the same.

00:58:18.597 --> 00:58:19.731
But the taste of an apple...

00:58:19.965 --> 00:58:23.202
depends on where it's grown,
how much sunlight it gets,

00:58:23.202 --> 00:58:26.038
- and when it's harvested.
- My goodness.

00:58:26.038 --> 00:58:27.840
Depending on them, it varies completely.

00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:29.341
- Here in Mungyeong,
- My goodness.

00:58:29.341 --> 00:58:32.044
the wide temperature swings
make the flesh firm...

00:58:32.044 --> 00:58:34.680
and wonderfully crisp.

00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:36.482
That's why it's known
for its high sweetness,

00:58:36.482 --> 00:58:38.317
a gentle tartness,

00:58:38.317 --> 00:58:39.751
and a perfectly balanced flavor.

00:58:39.751 --> 00:58:41.253
Sweet Home Shopping, right?

00:58:41.687 --> 00:58:44.523
I'd like to place an order
for what's on air right now.

00:58:44.990 --> 00:58:46.525
Let me take a bite.

00:58:46.525 --> 00:58:50.996
(500 sets sold)

00:58:51.463 --> 00:58:52.331
Yes.

00:58:52.764 --> 00:58:53.665
Yes.

00:58:54.733 --> 00:58:56.768
Crisp texture,

00:58:56.768 --> 00:58:58.237
bursting juice.

00:58:58.237 --> 00:58:59.771
How wonderfully fresh.

00:59:00.539 --> 00:59:02.541
No need for a long pitch.

00:59:02.541 --> 00:59:04.776
Let me show you today's deal right away.

00:59:05.911 --> 00:59:06.745
Here we go.

00:59:06.979 --> 00:59:08.013
This year's first harvest,

00:59:08.013 --> 00:59:11.250
Mungyeong Premium Fresh Apples,
a five kilogram box.

00:59:11.250 --> 00:59:14.753
If you order now, it's only 32.9 dollars.

00:59:14.753 --> 00:59:18.157
Since it's a pre-order,
we've slashed the price.

00:59:18.157 --> 00:59:19.024
And...

00:59:19.024 --> 00:59:21.260
even at a local farmer's market,

00:59:21.260 --> 00:59:24.029
you won't find a deal this good.

00:59:24.696 --> 00:59:25.831
They'll be picked next week...

00:59:25.831 --> 00:59:28.233
at peak flavor,

00:59:28.233 --> 00:59:30.769
and shipped directly from the orchard.

00:59:31.170 --> 00:59:33.572
You might wonder,

00:59:33.572 --> 00:59:35.774
"How can that be so cheap?"

00:59:35.774 --> 00:59:39.578
Well, this special broadcast...

00:59:39.578 --> 00:59:40.779
was made possible...

00:59:40.779 --> 00:59:43.282
through close collaboration
with the farmer, that's why.

00:59:43.282 --> 00:59:46.118
So remember,

00:59:46.118 --> 00:59:47.486
this offer is only valid today.

00:59:47.486 --> 00:59:51.156
We currently have 800 customers ordering.

00:59:51.156 --> 00:59:53.859
The average sweetness is over 14 Brix,

00:59:53.859 --> 00:59:57.462
with Mungyeong apples' signature
sweet, refreshing flavor.

00:59:57.462 --> 00:59:59.097
Once you taste it,

00:59:59.097 --> 01:00:02.501
you'll see how special
farm-direct shipping is.

01:00:02.501 --> 01:00:04.503
As we speak,

01:00:04.503 --> 01:00:06.605
we've just passed...

01:00:06.605 --> 01:00:08.173
one thousand customers.

01:00:08.173 --> 01:00:11.443
Please note that calls may be delayed.

01:00:11.443 --> 01:00:13.278
We apologize for the delay.

01:00:13.278 --> 01:00:15.747
But remember,
you can also order through the app.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:35.868
Great job.

01:00:35.868 --> 01:00:37.536
Thank you so much.

01:00:37.970 --> 01:00:39.071
You were incredible.

01:00:39.071 --> 01:00:40.172
Not at all.

01:00:40.172 --> 01:00:41.507
- Take care.
- Yes.

01:00:41.507 --> 01:00:43.041
- Great work, Ms. Cho.
- Tae Jeong.

01:00:43.041 --> 01:00:44.143
How's Ye Na?

01:00:44.443 --> 01:00:46.912
She's okay now.
Her swelling's gone down.

01:00:46.912 --> 01:00:48.614
Thank goodness.

01:00:48.614 --> 01:00:49.381
Yes.

01:00:50.449 --> 01:00:53.452
Sorry, though.
I couldn't sell out completely.

01:00:53.452 --> 01:00:56.054
What are you talking about?
We hit 80 percent sales.

01:00:56.054 --> 01:00:58.457
Considering what happened,
that's a miracle.

01:00:59.791 --> 01:01:01.527
I'd forgotten how good you are, Ms. Cho,

01:01:02.561 --> 01:01:04.229
and how you always had my back
when things were tough.

01:01:04.763 --> 01:01:06.732
You're flattering me.

01:01:07.566 --> 01:01:09.168
There's some apple juice left.
Would you like some?

01:01:09.168 --> 01:01:10.669
- Sure, let's go.
- Yes.

01:01:29.154 --> 01:01:30.055
Hello?

01:01:31.857 --> 01:01:32.891
Are you on your way back?

01:01:34.226 --> 01:01:36.161
Yes, we're almost there now.

01:01:36.695 --> 01:01:38.197
Then I'll keep it short.

01:01:39.131 --> 01:01:40.499
From what I saw today,

01:01:40.499 --> 01:01:43.135
you're ready to stop observing
and start hosting again.

01:01:45.771 --> 01:01:47.105
For fairness,

01:01:47.105 --> 01:01:49.074
you'll begin as a co-host, not the main.

01:01:49.808 --> 01:01:50.742
Does that sound good?

01:01:51.443 --> 01:01:52.945
Yes.

01:01:52.945 --> 01:01:54.847
Welcome back, Cho Na Jeong.

01:01:55.581 --> 01:01:58.484
What matters most is from here on,
so don't let your guard down.

01:02:00.619 --> 01:02:02.221
Understood, Executive Director.

01:02:03.188 --> 01:02:04.189
Thank you.

01:02:31.416 --> 01:02:32.351
Refreshing, right?

01:02:34.086 --> 01:02:36.054
This is small, but it's actually powerful.

01:02:56.241 --> 01:02:57.142
What's this about?

01:02:58.377 --> 01:02:59.344
Producer Noh.

01:03:00.479 --> 01:03:02.514
You don't want Na Jeong
staying at Sweet Home Shopping, do you?

01:03:04.883 --> 01:03:06.151
Can you make her leave?

01:03:07.219 --> 01:03:08.020
What?

01:04:24.763 --> 01:04:26.899
(Don't call me ma'am)

01:04:27.866 --> 01:04:30.002
Why am I imagining things?

01:04:32.171 --> 01:04:33.639
She hasn't even asked lately.

01:04:33.639 --> 01:04:35.374
If anything, I'm relieved.

01:04:35.374 --> 01:04:36.341
What are you doing here?

01:04:37.609 --> 01:04:39.077
Rebecca.

01:04:39.778 --> 01:04:41.513
I'm your biggest fan, Blunt Sister.

01:04:41.513 --> 01:04:42.681
She suddenly called me...

01:04:42.681 --> 01:04:44.416
and said she's in menopause now...

01:04:44.416 --> 01:04:46.418
and that she doesn't need pads anymore.

01:04:46.752 --> 01:04:48.687
Please share with us...

01:04:48.687 --> 01:04:50.856
what matters most to you.

01:04:50.856 --> 01:04:51.723
Vibes.

01:04:51.723 --> 01:04:52.424
Did you tell them...

01:04:52.424 --> 01:04:54.526
to cut me and make Yang Mi Sook
the co-host instead?

01:04:54.526 --> 01:04:55.360
Yes.

01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:56.995
You're no different from me, Na Jeong.

01:04:56.995 --> 01:04:59.031
How can you stay so calm...

01:04:59.031 --> 01:05:00.265
when your own mentor can't be reached?

01:05:01.333 --> 01:05:02.968
Ye Na.

01:05:06.538 --> 01:05:08.540
