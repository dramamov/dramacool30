[ELYSE] Deliver me.

[ELYSE] At the hour of my death

00:28.250 --> 00:29.904
At the hour of my death.

00:30.992 --> 00:31.819
Call me and bid me

00:31.993 --> 00:32.994
come to Thee.

Call me and bid me

00:34.430 --> 00:35.344
come to Thee.

Thee forever and ever...

Let me praise
Thee for ever and ever.

Jessica.

[footsteps]

01:10.640 --> 01:11.598
You don't even have the decency

01:11.772 --> 01:13.774
to be ashamed of yourself.

01:14.905 --> 01:16.342
I didn't mean to.

01:16.516 --> 01:19.040
Great. Yeah,
that totally un-fucks her.

01:19.214 --> 01:20.520
You don't have much time.

01:20.694 --> 01:21.782
Fight them!

01:33.315 --> 01:35.535
[ELYSE] The Lord is with thee.

01:36.492 --> 01:38.103
May the embers of your soul

escape this wickedness
and find shelter in His arms.

[THOMAS] Good.

02:44.908 --> 02:45.779
I don't...

02:46.823 --> 02:48.825
I don't take
pleasure in any of this.

02:50.087 --> 02:52.177
[ELYSE] It is a
trial, to be sure.

02:54.179 --> 02:55.658
[THOMAS] How many more...

02:56.616 --> 02:58.661
until we find the
beast that did this?

02:59.271 --> 03:01.403
[ELYSE] Two.
That we know of.

03:03.710 --> 03:04.363

Come with me.

04:35.802 --> 04:36.542
Come on.

04:50.295 --> 04:51.426
Move.

05:19.846 --> 05:20.890
Sit.

05:35.252 --> 05:36.776
[papers rustling]

05:40.214 --> 05:42.390
I was worried you
were going to be a talker.

05:45.611 --> 05:48.222
We get a lot of talkers.

05:50.224 --> 05:52.531
Name?

06:02.889 --> 06:04.543
Take a look around.

06:06.458 --> 06:08.938
Then look down at your wrists

06:09.112 --> 06:11.288
and ask yourself.

06:12.159 --> 06:13.900
Do I really
want to start this off

06:14.074 --> 06:16.293
by being a petulant brat?

06:20.689 --> 06:22.387
Hm?

Twenty-two.

06:48.935 --> 06:50.066
Sorry?

06:51.285 --> 06:53.243
What religion do you follow?

06:54.723 --> 06:56.246
None. Uh...

06:56.421 --> 06:57.726
I don't know.

06:57.900 --> 06:59.424
Agnostic?

07:03.689 --> 07:04.733
Number of sexual partners?

07:04.907 --> 07:06.561
What?

07:09.521 --> 07:11.044
Uh, none, uh...

07:11.218 --> 07:12.349
At the moment.

07:13.525 --> 07:14.569
Bit of a...

07:14.743 --> 07:16.266
Bit of a dry patch.

07:20.140 --> 07:22.534
Number of sexual partners?

07:22.838 --> 07:23.883
Three.

07:28.061 --> 07:29.105
Do you know this man?

07:30.977 --> 07:32.369
Have you slept with him?

07:32.544 --> 07:33.893
What? I--I--

07:34.459 --> 07:35.329
I don't--
I don't know this man--

07:35.503 --> 07:36.852
When did you sleep with him?

07:37.026 --> 07:38.114
You have me
confused with someone else.

07:38.288 --> 07:39.638
When did you sleep with Caleb?

07:39.812 --> 07:40.900
Look!

07:41.204 --> 07:42.554
Look.

07:43.163 --> 07:44.730
I don't know this man.

07:44.904 --> 07:45.948
I haven't slept with anyone.

07:46.122 --> 07:47.167
And...

07:47.341 --> 07:48.429
I don't know where I am

07:48.603 --> 07:51.606
or where here is. Please.

07:51.824 --> 07:52.825
I promise if you just...

07:52.999 --> 07:54.174
If you let me go, I-- I won't--

07:54.348 --> 07:55.915
I won't tell anyone.

07:56.089 --> 07:58.831
Don't know why
you insist on lying.

08:05.011 --> 08:07.056
I'm trying to save you.

08:26.772 --> 08:28.469
[grunting]

08:32.342 --> 08:33.822
[choking]

08:42.744 --> 08:44.572
[TORQUEMADA]
That's quite enough.

08:50.665 --> 08:52.188
I know what you're feeling.

08:53.929 --> 08:55.583
I understand how
confusing this must all

08:55.757 --> 08:56.932
be for you.

09:10.119 --> 09:11.860
In one of my early
placements within the church

09:12.034 --> 09:14.428
I interned for an excorcist.

09:14.602 --> 09:16.343
Father Mengucci.

09:17.300 --> 09:19.259
He was old by
the time I came through

09:19.433 --> 09:21.304
Well into his 80s.

09:22.479 --> 09:25.265
He seemed
one step above a mad man

09:25.439 --> 09:27.572
gibbering in the subway.

09:28.485 --> 09:30.662
Appearances are deceptive.

09:32.446 --> 09:33.621
And he could see things like

09:33.795 --> 09:35.928
no man I've ever known.

09:38.452 --> 09:41.063
We came to save Daniela,

09:41.237 --> 09:43.631
a young girl
not unlike yourself.

09:44.719 --> 09:46.025
Drug sick.

09:46.721 --> 09:47.940
Homeless.

09:49.550 --> 09:50.812
Broken.

09:52.814 --> 09:55.121
I saw a typically lost soul.

09:56.078 --> 09:59.038
But Father Mengucci
saw the true cause.

10:00.561 --> 10:01.910
That is...

10:02.563 --> 10:04.609
Until the beast
inside her ripped his throat

10:04.783 --> 10:06.611
from his body.

10:10.179 --> 10:12.573
I couldn't save that girl.

10:13.661 --> 10:15.968
My lack of faith failed her.

10:17.447 --> 10:18.797
And him.

10:20.407 --> 10:22.801
But since then,
I have studied diligently.

10:22.975 --> 10:26.979
And I can see things now well
beyond what Father Mengucci
could only dream of.

10:28.371 --> 10:30.156
So believe me

10:30.330 --> 10:33.333
when I tell you
that time is short.

10:35.248 --> 10:37.076
And you are sick.

10:39.687 --> 10:41.646
You can feel it.

10:43.256 --> 10:45.084
And in three
days that sickness will

10:45.258 --> 10:46.694
burn you up.

10:50.132 --> 10:52.134
And if that time comes.

10:54.049 --> 10:57.879
I will do for you what I should
have done for Daniela all those
years ago.

11:00.708 --> 11:03.102
I will put you down

11:03.537 --> 11:06.540
like the dog you've become.

11:07.802 --> 11:08.673
No-- no!

11:09.412 --> 11:10.065
No!

11:14.809 --> 11:16.245

11:19.640 --> 11:21.555
Now she knows the stakes.

11:22.295 --> 11:24.732
Now she has the
option to comply. [screaming]

11:25.907 --> 11:27.474
They'll never take it.

11:28.954 --> 11:31.304
But we have to
give them the choice.

11:32.261 --> 11:33.523

Please continue.

11:43.316 --> 11:44.709
Do you renounce the world,

11:44.883 --> 11:46.232

11:56.546 --> 11:57.722
Do you renounce

11:57.896 --> 11:59.462
the world,
the flesh and the Devil?

11:59.636 --> 12:02.117
Yes! Yes
anything. Please!

Again!

12:34.671 --> 12:36.064
Take her back to her cell.

12:37.109 --> 12:38.806
I'll run deeper checks
on everyone she's been with

12:38.980 --> 12:40.895
to confirm it's a
first-case contact.

13:20.152 --> 13:21.109
I slept with him.

13:21.283 --> 13:22.197
Is that what you want to hear?

13:22.371 --> 13:23.503
I don't know who the fuck he is.

13:23.677 --> 13:25.548
I've never
met him before, but if--

13:25.722 --> 13:26.593
If you want me to tell you that
I fucked him then I fucked him!

Please!

Please don't do this. Please...

You piece of shit!

16:32.300 --> 16:33.475
What? I--

16:34.389 --> 16:35.956
I know you.

16:36.652 --> 16:38.350
Oh?
No, no.

16:38.524 --> 16:40.743
I'm just passing through.

Uh. Sorry, Abel I--

16:52.973 --> 16:53.974
[ABEL] Sort it out.

16:54.148 --> 16:55.367
I'm off.

16:57.151 --> 16:58.413
Wow.

17:00.807 --> 17:02.069
[THOMAS] Well?

17:02.243 --> 17:04.070
Sorry. What
were you saying?

Is it always this nice in here?

Hello again.

18:17.536 --> 18:18.537
Did you enjoy looking through

18:18.711 --> 18:20.582
those photos on your phone?

18:22.715 --> 18:23.933
We did.

18:24.586 --> 18:26.022
We find that it...

18:27.285 --> 18:28.590
helps to

18:28.764 --> 18:30.766
have reminders in
the outside in here.

[lock clicks]

Don't worry.

18:35.815 --> 18:37.773
There's no reception.

18:41.386 --> 18:42.996
Get up.

Get up.

[light buzzing]

19:16.464 --> 19:17.813
Don't worry.

19:21.208 --> 19:23.341
We won't be interrupted today.

19:26.779 --> 19:29.564
Good, good. I'm...

I don't know if I
could go through that again...

19:44.100 --> 19:45.276
I'm sorry.

19:47.974 --> 19:49.976
Today is going to be

19:50.150 --> 19:51.238
much,

19:52.892 --> 19:54.328
much worse.

19:59.942 --> 20:01.248
You see,

20:01.422 --> 20:02.945
we need to get
this thing out of you.

20:03.859 --> 20:06.384
And I can't
stop until it's gone.

We're trying to save you.

You ungrateful mutt.

20:45.161 --> 20:46.075
I'm sorry.

20:46.250 --> 20:48.208
I don't need your apology.

20:49.209 --> 20:51.211
Save that for God.

20:52.168 --> 20:53.996
What I need

20:54.954 --> 20:56.521
is your patience today.

21:00.655 --> 21:01.830
I'm going to
open up your connection

21:02.004 --> 21:03.571
to the beast.

21:03.745 --> 21:05.007
To this...

21:06.008 --> 21:08.402
demon of passion.

21:09.534 --> 21:12.363
And that means enraging it.

21:12.537 --> 21:14.843
And that means enraging you.

21:17.803 --> 21:18.717
You.

21:19.326 --> 21:21.502
Jessica Marie Tanner.

21:21.676 --> 21:23.461
Twenty-two, currently homeless
and staying on the couch of
your friend

21:23.635 --> 21:25.506
Catherine Josie Scott,
also twenty-two

21:25.680 --> 21:27.291
who went to high school with.

21:29.075 --> 21:31.643
Recently broke up with
Matthew Alexander Roberts,

21:31.817 --> 21:34.298
who you've been
living with in sin...

21:34.472 --> 21:35.908
for the past three years.

21:36.082 --> 21:37.605
How long have
you been following me?

21:37.779 --> 21:39.433
Long enough.

21:40.434 --> 21:41.957
What?

21:42.131 --> 21:44.351
You know me now?

21:44.525 --> 21:46.440
You stalked me
for a couple of days and

21:46.614 --> 21:48.050
now you've judged me of

21:48.224 --> 21:50.792
being "of the beast"?

21:54.535 --> 21:57.625
Do you want me to tell you what
I've done like this is a
confessional?

21:59.845 --> 22:00.846
Nothing.

22:01.020 --> 22:03.370
Fucking nothing.

22:03.762 --> 22:05.416
I've smoked some weed.

22:05.677 --> 22:06.895
Popped some pills
at a rave one time.

22:07.069 --> 22:08.244
Didn't like it.

22:08.419 --> 22:10.029
Slept with three boys.

22:10.203 --> 22:12.118
One of whom didn't even
get it in enough to count.

22:12.771 --> 22:15.774
My parents moved out west
and I haven't seen them since.

22:15.948 --> 22:17.602
I work at a bar.

22:17.776 --> 22:19.952
I get up, go to work, come
home exhausted, and go to sleep.

22:20.126 --> 22:23.390
The only people that I've seen
in the past month has been Kate,
Kate's boyfriend,

22:23.564 --> 22:24.391
and then the people that I--

22:25.392 --> 22:26.872
see at--

22:30.397 --> 22:31.790
And the--

22:40.538 --> 22:42.714
You can feel it
burning can't you?

22:45.281 --> 22:47.545
And you're seeing it now?

22:50.156 --> 22:52.114
As this corruption

22:52.288 --> 22:53.986
gets closer to burning you out
you're going to start to
see things

22:55.030 --> 22:58.033
and remember things
that aren't your memories.

22:59.121 --> 23:00.732
Where's Kate?

23:05.693 --> 23:08.609
You know the
answer to that question.

23:10.219 --> 23:11.395
What did you do to her?

23:13.919 --> 23:15.921
You tell me.

23:18.532 --> 23:20.099
Go on, pup.

23:21.100 --> 23:23.232
Get a good whiff of her scent.

23:29.369 --> 23:30.414
[inhales]

23:37.072 --> 23:38.639
[grunting]

23:46.604 --> 23:48.997
[panting]

23:51.043 --> 23:52.871
[KATE] Well,
my dad hates you so...

23:53.045 --> 23:54.829
[ALEX] Fuck,
well I don't like him either.

23:55.308 --> 23:56.483
[knocking]

24:01.183 --> 24:02.402
NO!

24:02.707 --> 24:04.404
[ELYSE] Go go go go go go.

24:05.666 --> 24:06.406
Fu--

24:09.757 --> 24:10.758
[screaming]

24:12.064 --> 24:13.195
[grunting]

24:14.327 --> 24:15.371
[squealing]

24:18.592 --> 24:19.811
Where's Kate?

24:20.420 --> 24:21.421
[whimpering]

24:24.946 --> 24:27.166
[soft crying]

24:28.646 --> 24:30.865
[Jess gasping]

24:35.304 --> 24:36.523
[sobbing]

24:37.481 --> 24:39.613
We kept them alive
for as long as we could.

24:41.049 --> 24:43.312
We questioned them

24:43.487 --> 24:45.532
and when we were sure we had
everything, we checked them for
evil spirits.

24:49.928 --> 24:51.886
The boy
struggled with the tests.

24:52.365 --> 24:53.497
[grunting]

24:57.326 --> 24:59.503
He was so weak.

25:00.808 --> 25:02.506
The girl...

25:08.337 --> 25:09.643
She lied to me.

25:15.214 --> 25:16.476
A lot.

25:17.172 --> 25:19.479
We had to treat her
as if she was infected.

25:24.615 --> 25:26.051
[sobbing]

25:29.054 --> 25:31.491
If the beast had been
in her body as it is in yours

25:31.665 --> 25:33.885
she would have survived
and we could have purified her.

25:38.193 --> 25:39.978
Thankfully,

25:40.152 --> 25:41.936
she wasn't infected and

25:42.110 --> 25:44.373
we were able to
give her her last rites.

25:45.897 --> 25:48.290
Her soul is with the Father now.

25:56.429 --> 25:58.518
[Jess sobbing]

26:08.659 --> 26:11.444
We have just two days
now before the first moon.

26:12.576 --> 26:14.403
Anyone harboring an
infection at that point

26:14.578 --> 26:16.884
will burn from the inside out.

26:19.539 --> 26:22.020
The beast
will consume your soul,

26:22.194 --> 26:24.370
and your body will become

26:24.544 --> 26:27.547
nothing more than a
plaything for the Devil himself.

26:32.596 --> 26:34.946
If we're going to save you,

26:35.120 --> 26:37.470
I'll need to be quick.

26:38.732 --> 26:40.342
Decisive.

26:41.996 --> 26:44.433
And pay no
attention to your screams.

26:50.918 --> 26:53.834
You see, this illness has been
around for a very long time,

26:54.008 --> 26:56.402
and we have
developed a number of solutions.

26:59.579 --> 27:01.537
But the old ways
are still the best.

27:03.539 --> 27:04.584
What... what--

27:04.758 --> 27:06.368
It's wolfsbane.

27:06.542 --> 27:08.632
Hush.
Hush, hush.

27:09.110 --> 27:10.024
Hush.

27:15.551 --> 27:17.989
Jessica Tanner,
Jessica Tanner, Jessica Tanner.

27:18.163 --> 27:20.731
Thrice named and bound.

27:21.383 --> 27:23.516
I bring the Lord unto thee.

27:25.300 --> 27:27.041
[screaming]

27:31.176 --> 27:32.743
[gasping]

27:34.788 --> 27:36.442
I cast thee out!

27:40.228 --> 27:42.230
[footsteps]

27:46.278 --> 27:47.888
[MONIQUE] Hush, sister.
[hush sister]

27:48.062 --> 27:49.934
I know how this feels.
[this feels]

27:57.506 --> 27:59.378
[eerie music]

28:30.061 --> 28:32.019
[distant whispering]

28:55.521 --> 28:57.566
[Jess grunting]

29:03.007 --> 29:04.269
Fuck!

29:08.186 --> 29:09.143
Come on.

29:09.317 --> 29:10.536
Fuck.

29:16.934 --> 29:18.457
[screaming]

29:23.070 --> 29:24.811
[suspenseful music]

30:09.247 --> 30:09.769
[BOUNCER] Heh?

30:11.510 --> 30:12.337
Uh...

30:12.511 --> 30:14.078
I'm here to see Caleb.

30:35.490 --> 30:37.753
Here.

30:37.928 --> 30:39.755
It's everything we have on you.

30:44.151 --> 30:45.761
It's comprehensive.

30:51.637 --> 30:53.073
Alright, look.

30:53.769 --> 30:56.076
I started working for
my father about a year ago.

30:56.250 --> 30:59.123
And in that
time, we have dogged to you

30:59.297 --> 31:01.734
from Kolokotroni Square,
across half of Asia.

31:03.127 --> 31:04.606
I'm starting to
lose count of the people

31:04.780 --> 31:05.694
that we've...

31:05.869 --> 31:06.870
Killed?

31:08.088 --> 31:09.742
It's not like that.

31:10.308 --> 31:12.614
We were trying to save them.
I just I--

31:14.007 --> 31:15.879
I want it to stop.

31:17.924 --> 31:21.232
You know, they used to use
leeches to cure ear infections.

31:21.493 --> 31:23.495
They'd shove the
wriggling things into your head

31:23.669 --> 31:26.193
and hope they
could drain the poison.

31:27.847 --> 31:30.632
They used to treat
epilepsy with exorcisms.

31:30.806 --> 31:32.983
And that's what this is?

31:33.505 --> 31:36.508
Some overblown embolism.

31:40.251 --> 31:41.948
It's hard to describe.

31:43.036 --> 31:44.037
How do you embellish the color

31:44.211 --> 31:46.170
red to a man who is colorblind?

31:48.607 --> 31:49.825
Or faith

31:50.000 --> 31:52.089
to a man who has none.

31:56.876 --> 31:59.096
How about we both
try and see if we can't

31:59.270 --> 32:00.271
meet in the middle.

32:07.147 --> 32:08.018
[ELYSE] From the Evil One...

32:08.192 --> 32:09.019
[TEGAN] Jessica.

32:09.715 --> 32:10.716
[distant voices]

32:11.021 --> 32:11.847
[ELYSE] Today is going to be--

32:12.022 --> 32:13.980
[ELYSE] I cast thee out.

32:14.633 --> 32:15.895
[voices]

32:16.069 --> 32:17.157
[ELYSE] At the
hour of my death...

32:17.592 --> 32:19.855
[disembodied voices]

32:22.728 --> 32:24.164
[screaming]

32:24.730 --> 32:26.819
[ELYSE] When did
you sleep with Caleb?

32:27.298 --> 32:28.125
[ELYSE] There she is...

32:31.084 --> 32:33.391
[ELYSE] Jessica Tanner,
Jessica tanner...

32:34.131 --> 32:35.828
[whispered voices]

32:37.047 --> 32:39.179
[TEGAN] Jessica
you need to wake up.

32:43.749 --> 32:45.098
[MONIQUE] Finally.

32:46.012 --> 32:47.100
Thank God you
found your way here.

32:48.188 --> 32:48.884
What?

32:49.059 --> 32:50.495
What's going on?

32:51.191 --> 32:53.324
Well, do you mean here or there?

32:54.281 --> 32:56.283
I don't know. Both?

32:56.501 --> 32:59.460
Well, there you're in
a facility to be cured.

33:00.070 --> 33:01.462
So am I.

33:02.115 --> 33:03.682
Cured of what?

33:04.857 --> 33:06.076
Passion.

33:06.990 --> 33:08.165
And fire.

33:08.556 --> 33:10.036
Of the wolf.

33:12.125 --> 33:15.085
Are you trying to tell me
that they think I'm a werewolf?

33:17.391 --> 33:20.264
You're just brand
new to this, aren't you?

33:20.438 --> 33:21.961
Did you even meet Caleb?

33:23.397 --> 33:24.572
The guy from the photos?
I mean--

33:24.746 --> 33:26.096
Look, you'd remember.

33:26.270 --> 33:27.532
I don't remember anything.

33:27.706 --> 33:29.012
I don't even
know how I got here.

33:29.186 --> 33:31.362
Yeah, the drugs
take a while to wear off.

33:31.623 --> 33:32.798
Fuck.

33:33.059 --> 33:34.800
Look, we don't
have a lot of time.

33:34.974 --> 33:36.497
Okay? They're going to be back
here any minute for my next...

33:36.671 --> 33:38.021
treatment.

33:38.586 --> 33:40.284
How long have you been here?

33:41.850 --> 33:43.635
Long enough.

33:44.636 --> 33:46.116
Listen,

33:46.290 --> 33:48.509
if you're here,
they think you're infected.

33:48.683 --> 33:50.990
And if you didn't get it from
Caleb, it came through someone
who loved you

33:51.164 --> 33:51.947
very much.

33:53.079 --> 33:55.038
The change is a gift of passion.

33:55.212 --> 33:58.563
And so in passion it is passed.

34:01.479 --> 34:02.610
Are you saying that...

34:02.784 --> 34:04.090
I'm going
to turn into a werewolf

34:04.264 --> 34:06.310
because I didn't use protection?

34:07.267 --> 34:08.485
Something like that.

34:09.139 --> 34:10.139
[door unlocks]

34:11.706 --> 34:13.143
Look, they're here.

34:13.665 --> 34:14.621
Listen.

34:15.145 --> 34:16.842
This is a spirit realm.

34:17.016 --> 34:20.063
Okay? We're talking here because
we're of the same bloodline.

34:20.454 --> 34:22.108
It's a shared space so...

34:22.282 --> 34:23.675
Find me here?

34:24.154 --> 34:25.590
When you can.

34:26.460 --> 34:27.722
No, no, please.

34:27.896 --> 34:30.116
Please, please don't leave me!

34:32.031 --> 34:33.076
[laughter echoes]

34:34.773 --> 34:36.382
Oh no, there's
no need to apologize.

34:36.556 --> 34:37.906
I'll be the first to admit.

34:38.081 --> 34:39.864
I don't look like
the punk rocker type.

34:40.213 --> 34:42.346
I didn't say that.

34:43.042 --> 34:44.696
I did not say that.

34:44.870 --> 34:45.958
But!

34:46.219 --> 34:47.916
Right through the chest.

34:48.873 --> 34:51.703
But you... You kind of
got the look down. Do you play?

34:52.312 --> 34:53.487
Nah.

34:53.661 --> 34:55.228
Never really
found the time to learn.

34:58.666 --> 35:00.407
Okay, okay. Yeah.

35:00.581 --> 35:03.628
My parents bought me a guitar
lessons when I was fifteen.

35:04.150 --> 35:06.239
I was sick of playing
'Ode to Joy' on repeat.

35:06.413 --> 35:09.590
So I learned the riff
to 'Smoke On the Water'

35:09.764 --> 35:12.158
Then... I
just used it as a prop for

35:12.332 --> 35:13.507
karaoke in my room.

35:16.510 --> 35:17.642
What?

35:17.903 --> 35:19.252
You don't like karaoke?

35:19.426 --> 35:22.864
No. I love it
a bit too much.

35:25.389 --> 35:27.826
So you focused
on singing instead?

35:28.000 --> 35:29.480
Um, I guess.

35:29.654 --> 35:32.396
I wouldn't exactly
call my screams singing.

35:32.570 --> 35:35.573
But I did hang out with the
garage band for a few months.

35:36.095 --> 35:38.967
But then uni
kicked into gear and Matt

35:39.142 --> 35:41.535
took up a lot of my spare time.

35:42.188 --> 35:44.451
Wasted investment, huh?

35:46.236 --> 35:48.977
Nope. No
such thing.

35:50.283 --> 35:51.676
You loved.

35:51.850 --> 35:53.504
You learned.

35:55.070 --> 35:56.855
And love...

35:58.073 --> 36:00.032
That's a pretty important thing.

36:02.034 --> 36:03.514
[MAN] Oi! Somebody--

36:03.688 --> 36:04.776
[men heckling]

36:04.950 --> 36:05.559
Sorry.

36:05.733 --> 36:06.734
Duty calls.

36:06.908 --> 36:08.301
[MAN] Come on!

36:08.475 --> 36:10.695
Hey, no need to apologize.
It's your job.

36:11.609 --> 36:12.871
And I know what happens
when you break the rules.

36:13.045 --> 36:14.786
Remember?

36:20.139 --> 36:21.749
[THOMAS] Just
make it convincing.

36:22.228 --> 36:23.621
[intense music]

36:27.755 --> 36:29.104
Okay, okay. I'm going.

36:29.279 --> 36:30.584
But when I come
back, you're telling me

36:30.758 --> 36:32.325
how you stop those
cops from writing you up.

36:32.499 --> 36:33.631
Yep.

36:34.066 --> 36:35.633
[rowdy men noises]

36:36.373 --> 36:37.809
[laughter]

36:48.994 --> 36:50.430
Anything else?

36:50.604 --> 36:52.780
I don't know. Maybe
you want a drink too!

36:52.998 --> 36:54.042
[men heckling]

36:54.956 --> 36:56.480
Come on, sweetheart.
We're just playing.

36:56.654 --> 36:59.047
You look like you like
a little bit of play time.

37:00.353 --> 37:01.093
No thanks, pal.

37:01.267 --> 37:02.529
Yeah, same goes for her.

37:02.703 --> 37:04.314
We're just trying
to have a good night!

37:05.445 --> 37:07.012
Fuck or fight. I'm happy.

37:07.186 --> 37:08.492
Get the fuck out now!

37:08.666 --> 37:10.058
Hey, listen...

37:10.233 --> 37:10.885
Did you hear me?

37:11.059 --> 37:12.496
Grab your shit.

37:12.670 --> 37:14.367
You're fucking done.
I'm calling the cops.

37:18.980 --> 37:20.982
Are you alright?

37:21.548 --> 37:24.421
Normally, I'd say you should
see the other guy but you did.

37:24.595 --> 37:26.249
And he's fine.

37:26.945 --> 37:28.468
I need ice.

37:35.823 --> 37:36.998
It's you.

37:37.651 --> 37:39.958
You're the monster
they're all talking about.

37:41.089 --> 37:42.613
How did you infect me?

37:42.787 --> 37:44.528
Did I sleep with you?

37:55.321 --> 37:56.757
[lock clicking]

38:15.167 --> 38:16.995
[suspenseful music]

38:19.302 --> 38:21.042
[music intensifies]

38:22.435 --> 38:23.349
Jessica.

38:23.523 --> 38:24.742
Get in!

38:33.707 --> 38:34.882
[men yelling]

38:51.334 --> 38:52.900
I'm sorry.

38:54.511 --> 38:55.294
I'm sorry.

38:55.468 --> 38:56.948
I'm so sorry.

38:59.298 --> 38:59.907
What?

39:00.081 --> 39:00.908
No, it's fine.

39:01.082 --> 39:02.780
You saved me.

39:05.565 --> 39:06.697
What?
What's going on?

39:06.871 --> 39:08.568
Why are we stopping?

39:36.509 --> 39:39.294
[door creaking]

39:41.340 --> 39:43.342
[footsteps]

39:49.566 --> 39:51.437
Hey there, Jessica.

39:57.356 --> 39:59.532
I brought you some food.

40:00.011 --> 40:01.229
Uh...

40:06.583 --> 40:08.498
[light buzzing]

40:10.064 --> 40:11.805
[water dripping]

40:33.261 --> 40:35.002
I know it's not a much but

40:35.176 --> 40:36.526
that's by intent.

40:38.005 --> 40:38.963
They want to keep you alive

40:39.137 --> 40:41.356
but if you're too strong and

40:41.531 --> 40:44.055
the beast gets stronger and...

40:45.056 --> 40:47.101
it's just harder to fight.

40:56.328 --> 40:57.590
I really am sorry.

40:57.764 --> 40:59.331
I just didn't
think you'd come with me

40:59.505 --> 41:01.464
if I told you the truth.

41:03.291 --> 41:05.163
Was any of it true?

41:09.036 --> 41:11.561
I like to think
our connection was.

41:13.171 --> 41:14.738
Grew up poor.

41:15.565 --> 41:18.089
Started traveling
about as soon as I could.

41:18.655 --> 41:20.352
That was all true.

41:21.440 --> 41:23.660
Bought a crappy car.

41:25.183 --> 41:26.314
Camped in it.

41:26.489 --> 41:28.795
Drove from coast to coast.

41:30.754 --> 41:31.711
Mean guitar

41:31.885 --> 41:33.321
I could barely play and...

41:35.236 --> 41:36.411
A desired to see more

41:36.586 --> 41:38.413
than the
decaying town of my youth.

41:44.594 --> 41:47.553
But as much as I wanted
to be different from my dad.

41:49.686 --> 41:51.122
I started drinking.

41:53.603 --> 41:55.213
And I liked it.

41:56.127 --> 41:57.302
[stammers] And I-- I--

41:57.476 --> 41:58.651
I just--

41:59.826 --> 42:01.567
I just grew so lonely.

42:05.310 --> 42:06.354
And that was

42:06.529 --> 42:09.227
when Father Torquemada found me.

42:10.620 --> 42:12.447
It was in my final days

42:13.013 --> 42:14.798
when I was determined to die.

42:15.102 --> 42:17.540
But I was too
scared to kill myself.

42:21.108 --> 42:21.892
And--

42:23.807 --> 42:25.069
Kidnaping and torture...?

42:27.201 --> 42:28.072
Don't.

42:28.594 --> 42:29.552
That isn't--

42:38.735 --> 42:39.649
I can see

42:40.737 --> 42:42.521
how it would seem that way

42:43.522 --> 42:44.784
from where you're sitting.

42:47.961 --> 42:49.397
If you think about it.

42:50.398 --> 42:52.836
I mean, really think about it.

42:55.273 --> 42:56.361
What would you do...

42:58.363 --> 42:59.625
If you knew

42:59.799 --> 43:01.496
someone was
going to die horribly?

43:03.107 --> 43:04.325
Where would you draw the line?

43:04.499 --> 43:05.283
Hm?

43:06.240 --> 43:08.242
If- if- if you had a
chance to save a loved one,

43:08.416 --> 43:10.244
would you cut off a finger?

43:12.464 --> 43:13.639
Would you do that?

43:15.423 --> 43:16.163
A hand?

43:16.337 --> 43:17.425
What about an arm?

43:18.513 --> 43:19.297
Hm?

43:20.559 --> 43:21.473
I don't know.

43:23.040 --> 43:24.128
You already killed Kate.

43:28.349 --> 43:29.002
Yeah.

43:30.874 --> 43:31.744
Yeah, we did.

43:34.007 --> 43:35.269
Well, I can't deny that.

43:38.272 --> 43:40.797
But if you
accept, even for a second,

43:41.754 --> 43:43.147
what we believe

43:44.365 --> 43:46.977
you are going to see
that we had no choice.

43:49.240 --> 43:50.720
Like, you're sweating.

43:53.505 --> 43:56.029
It's freezing in
here, and you're sweating.

44:00.338 --> 44:01.469
Come on.

44:01.774 --> 44:02.993
Elyse is waiting.

44:11.392 --> 44:13.003
I promise I am
trying to help you.

44:13.220 --> 44:14.352
Please, I can't--

44:16.571 --> 44:18.138
Thank you for drinking that.

44:18.530 --> 44:20.097
It's designed
to make this easier

44:20.271 --> 44:21.315
and not hurt you.

44:21.489 --> 44:23.361
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey.

44:23.535 --> 44:24.536
I got you.

44:28.148 --> 44:29.715
I got you, I got you, I got you.

44:36.026 --> 44:37.592
[suspenseful music]

44:42.685 --> 44:43.555
[MATT] Jess.

44:43.729 --> 44:44.121
Matt!
[MATT] Jess!

44:44.295 --> 44:45.252
Go!

44:45.426 --> 44:46.732
Go! Get
out of here!

44:47.515 --> 44:49.169
[screaming]

44:49.474 --> 44:50.562
[indistinct yelling]

44:51.041 --> 44:51.824
[MATT] Go!

44:52.085 --> 44:53.391
You shouldn't be here!

44:54.044 --> 44:55.698
You shouldn't be here!

44:56.437 --> 44:57.221
[THOMAS] Jessica.

44:57.395 --> 44:58.004
[yelling, struggling]

44:58.178 --> 44:58.526
We have to go.

45:00.703 --> 45:01.921
[indistinct yelling]

45:02.095 --> 45:03.140
Let her go!

45:17.632 --> 45:18.764
[water drips]

45:23.508 --> 45:24.770
[dripping water]

45:40.438 --> 45:42.396
Do you think we have a
chance to save her here?

45:44.311 --> 45:45.791
We don't save her.

45:47.750 --> 45:48.533
God does.

45:48.707 --> 45:49.969
I know. I just--

45:50.143 --> 45:52.624
Do not delude
yourself, Brother Thomas.

45:53.756 --> 45:56.802
You have no power
over what happens here.

45:58.673 --> 46:00.893
All you can do
is show her the door.

46:09.162 --> 46:10.816
How are you
feeling today, Jessica?

46:11.991 --> 46:12.818
I don't know.

46:13.776 --> 46:15.690
I really wish I
could see that fucking door.

46:18.998 --> 46:20.347
So you heard that?

46:21.479 --> 46:22.959
Enhanced hearing
indicates a progression

46:23.133 --> 46:24.308
in the infection.

46:29.966 --> 46:30.880
We're going to try

46:31.054 --> 46:31.924
a different treatment today.

46:34.622 --> 46:36.537
Something a bit more severe.

46:38.322 --> 46:39.758
But remember, Jessica,

46:40.498 --> 46:42.848
these are in the
actions of the flesh.

46:43.327 --> 46:44.328
[cupboard creaks open]

46:46.025 --> 46:47.940
If you truly wish to be saved.

46:50.856 --> 46:52.815
You must unburden yourself.

47:00.170 --> 47:00.997
[scream]

47:01.475 --> 47:02.868
[grunting]

47:03.042 --> 47:04.870
I don't want to hear
any more of your lies!

47:05.044 --> 47:06.132
[THOMAS] Jessica!

47:06.959 --> 47:08.569
Look at what you're doing.

47:08.743 --> 47:10.006
You haven't
eaten properly in days and

47:10.180 --> 47:12.617
you are lifting
her off the ground.

47:12.878 --> 47:13.792
Jessica.

47:14.662 --> 47:15.533
You're killing her.

47:19.972 --> 47:20.755
[gasping]

47:20.930 --> 47:22.714
Yes, Jess, it's true.

47:23.541 --> 47:24.498
It's true.

47:24.890 --> 47:25.673
[coughing]

47:26.239 --> 47:26.936
I don't--

47:27.806 --> 47:29.068
I don't understand how.

47:29.764 --> 47:31.027
[stammers]
How I could-- how I can--

47:31.201 --> 47:32.158
Now you know
we're right about that.

47:33.594 --> 47:35.683
What if we're right
about the other part?

47:37.424 --> 47:39.600
Do you really want
to gamble with your soul?

47:43.213 --> 47:44.736
Oh love, this is good.

47:44.910 --> 47:46.085
It's good.

47:46.956 --> 47:47.521
[THOMAS] It is.

47:49.088 --> 47:51.090
I know it doesn't
feel that way but...

47:51.438 --> 47:52.309
It's good.

47:53.310 --> 47:54.746
Well it's the first step.

47:55.965 --> 47:57.531
And if you work with us...

47:59.359 --> 48:00.404
There's a chance.

48:01.840 --> 48:02.449
Yeah?

48:04.625 --> 48:05.800
There's a chance.

48:12.982 --> 48:14.157
[dripping water]

48:18.901 --> 48:20.380
[muffled panting]

48:21.164 --> 48:22.208
[screaming]

48:34.742 --> 48:36.440
We beg you
through the intercession

48:36.614 --> 48:39.747
and help of the Archangels
Michael, Rafael, and Gabriel,

48:40.966 --> 48:43.795
for the deliverance of
our brothers and sisters,

48:43.969 --> 48:45.753
who are enslaved by
the Evil One. [screaming]

48:47.146 --> 48:48.104
[gasping]

48:50.062 --> 48:51.846
All saints of heaven,

48:53.326 --> 48:54.458
come to our aid.

48:56.068 --> 48:57.461
From anxiety,

48:57.765 --> 48:58.679
sadness,

48:59.158 --> 48:59.898
and obsession,

49:01.030 --> 49:02.248
we beg you.

49:02.988 --> 49:04.250
Free us, O Lord. [screaming]

49:05.643 --> 49:07.732
From hatred, fornication,

49:09.299 --> 49:10.169
and envy,

49:11.170 --> 49:12.171
we beg you.

49:13.172 --> 49:14.086
[screaming]

49:14.260 --> 49:14.434
[screaming] Free us, O Lord.

49:20.397 --> 49:24.314
From every form of
sinful sexuality, we beg you...

49:26.533 --> 49:28.361
Free us, O Lord.

49:29.493 --> 49:30.755
[gasping]

49:31.712 --> 49:32.452
Thomas.

49:35.368 --> 49:36.282
It's time for you

49:36.456 --> 49:37.457
to put your feelings aside.

49:39.807 --> 49:41.287
And do God's work.

49:52.037 --> 49:53.256
[whimpering]

49:56.781 --> 49:58.043
[quiet sobbing]

50:00.785 --> 50:01.916
[JESS] P-please...

50:02.308 --> 50:03.092
Thomas...

50:06.878 --> 50:07.748
Thomas.

50:08.445 --> 50:10.621
Thomas, please.

50:10.795 --> 50:12.362
From every division in our
family... [JESS] Please no,
Thomas, please!

50:14.886 --> 50:15.974
[JESS] No,
I'm begging you, Thomas!

50:16.148 --> 50:17.367
Please don't do this to me!

50:17.541 --> 50:18.629
From every harmful friendship,

50:22.807 --> 50:23.851
No!
Thomas!

50:24.026 --> 50:25.027
I beg you...
[JESS] Please!

50:25.201 --> 50:26.767
No no no no no no no no no.

50:26.941 --> 50:27.681
[screaming]

50:27.855 --> 50:29.248
Free us, O Lord.

50:30.815 --> 50:32.251
And from every spell,

50:33.600 --> 50:34.427
malefic,

50:34.601 --> 50:35.646
witchcraft,

50:36.995 --> 50:39.041
and every form of the occult,

50:39.824 --> 50:40.912
we beg you.

50:41.956 --> 50:43.784
Free us, O Lord. [screaming]

50:48.746 --> 50:49.790
[gasping]

50:50.400 --> 50:51.401
I can't do this.

50:58.060 --> 50:59.365
[screaming]

51:10.942 --> 51:12.248
[door opens]

51:15.033 --> 51:16.121
[THOMAS] Gentle...

51:18.036 --> 51:19.472
There's a step here.

51:20.125 --> 51:21.300
Just watch your...

51:22.432 --> 51:23.563
That's one step.

51:24.912 --> 51:25.739
Another step.

51:30.788 --> 51:32.181
I wish I hadn't have left you.

51:35.227 --> 51:36.272
See, here.

51:38.448 --> 51:38.926
Here.

51:41.538 --> 51:42.930
Try rest on the floor tonight.

51:43.105 --> 51:44.062
Oh, easy!

51:49.981 --> 51:51.330
You've earned a respite.

52:03.560 --> 52:04.865
Now, I know this feeling.

52:08.217 --> 52:09.740
It's the absence of God.

52:13.831 --> 52:15.180
But if you reach out to him,

52:16.921 --> 52:18.052
he'll comfort you.

52:23.580 --> 52:25.103
He will comfort you.

52:27.845 --> 52:29.151
Oh, shhh...

52:29.673 --> 52:31.109
Jessica, it's all right.

52:31.805 --> 52:32.893
It's all right.

52:33.894 --> 52:34.982
It's all right.

52:38.725 --> 52:39.422
Lord.

52:41.163 --> 52:43.730
Look upon Jessica
with eyes of mercy.

52:45.384 --> 52:48.039
May You place on
her a healing hand.

52:51.216 --> 52:54.306
And may You
send Archangel Raphael

52:55.699 --> 52:56.874
to comfort,

52:57.396 --> 52:58.658
cleanse

52:59.616 --> 53:00.834
and purify her.

53:02.619 --> 53:04.577
Bring her back to your side.

53:05.622 --> 53:09.452
And may she service your purpose
and all that reside in the

53:09.626 --> 53:10.888
Kingdom of Heaven.

53:12.716 --> 53:13.586
Amen.

53:32.257 --> 53:34.216
I know this is
impossible for you.

53:37.610 --> 53:38.916
You know I lost someone.

53:40.874 --> 53:42.049
That I cared for

53:43.007 --> 53:44.138
very deeply.

53:46.619 --> 53:48.055
She, uh,

53:49.709 --> 53:50.841
came with me

53:52.408 --> 53:53.844
when I left home.

53:56.107 --> 53:57.413
And it was wrong.

53:59.066 --> 53:59.806
I mean, her parents didn't

53:59.980 --> 54:01.373
care that she was...

54:03.506 --> 54:04.985
And we were so young.

54:08.511 --> 54:10.077
But we drove my car and

54:12.471 --> 54:14.125
we hugged the coastline and...

54:16.823 --> 54:17.868
Hugged each other and

54:18.042 --> 54:19.783
kept each other warm at night.

54:20.914 --> 54:22.220
She used to sing.

54:22.742 --> 54:24.440
So we stop
at the mall and, and--

54:24.614 --> 54:26.137
you know, lay a, lay a--

54:26.311 --> 54:27.704
lay a towel down.

54:28.531 --> 54:29.749
They would throw coins on it.

54:29.923 --> 54:31.360
and sometimes then I'd
be strumming

54:32.491 --> 54:33.710
along with my guitar.

54:33.884 --> 54:35.668
But I think that
made people give us less.

54:40.717 --> 54:44.068
I didn't go with her the
night she went to that club.

54:45.417 --> 54:47.376
It was the first
night of a competition

54:47.941 --> 54:48.681
and I said...

54:50.074 --> 54:51.815
that I wanted to sit in the car

54:51.989 --> 54:53.295
and get high.

54:59.997 --> 55:01.694
And the police,
they were reluctant to tell me

55:01.868 --> 55:03.696
anything at first because, um,

55:05.916 --> 55:06.960
I was a suspect.

55:10.529 --> 55:12.662
Three men followed her
out of the club that night.

55:14.533 --> 55:15.795
And they called it

55:15.969 --> 55:17.536
"a crime of passion".

55:19.364 --> 55:20.931
And then three days later,

55:22.628 --> 55:23.586
her body

55:24.674 --> 55:26.110
washes up on the shore.

55:29.853 --> 55:30.854
Her body

55:32.116 --> 55:33.596
hugged the shoreline.

55:35.032 --> 55:36.642
And I was so broken

55:37.382 --> 55:38.905
when Father Torquemada found me.

55:41.430 --> 55:42.561
But you know what?

55:44.041 --> 55:45.303
He brought me in

55:46.957 --> 55:48.480
and he healed me.

55:51.048 --> 55:52.092
And Jessica.

55:55.574 --> 55:57.184
That's what we can do for you.

56:00.927 --> 56:02.668
But you have to trust us.

56:05.105 --> 56:05.932
Trust me.

56:15.246 --> 56:16.378
Oh, oh, oh. Careful.

56:18.554 --> 56:19.381
You okay?

56:24.560 --> 56:25.474
No, I don't-- I can't.

56:25.648 --> 56:26.953
I can't. Sorry I don't, um--

56:34.439 --> 56:35.919
I'm sorry, I can't do this.

56:37.007 --> 56:38.225
[gasping]

56:43.579 --> 56:44.928
NO!

56:50.586 --> 56:52.457
[screaming]

56:55.286 --> 56:56.200
[panting]

57:03.512 --> 57:04.687
[MONIQUE] Second session.

57:06.079 --> 57:08.430
[MATT] Yeah,
I remember that one.

57:13.217 --> 57:14.348
[MATT] Hey, Jess.

57:16.786 --> 57:17.874
Yep, I'm here too.

57:22.052 --> 57:22.879
I don't, I don't--

57:23.227 --> 57:24.446
I don't understand.

57:26.012 --> 57:27.100
I knew they
were coming for me after

57:27.274 --> 57:28.493
they took Monique.

57:30.800 --> 57:31.931
I tried calling you.

57:33.150 --> 57:33.629
But...

57:35.979 --> 57:36.806
I get it.

57:38.024 --> 57:39.156
I know how it must have looked.

57:41.332 --> 57:42.812
[footsteps]

57:50.602 --> 57:51.777
[bed creaking]

57:56.042 --> 57:56.869
[MATT] Yeah.

57:57.609 --> 57:58.958
Ugh! You
piece of shit!

57:59.219 --> 58:00.133
You did this to me!

58:00.307 --> 58:01.047
Fuck!

58:02.832 --> 58:03.397
I'm sorry.

58:03.572 --> 58:04.137
Don't.

58:07.532 --> 58:08.185
So.

58:09.142 --> 58:10.448
Genuine passion?

58:11.014 --> 58:11.928
That's what you said.

58:15.061 --> 58:16.062
Jess.

58:16.236 --> 58:17.542
So you didn't just cheat on me.

58:17.934 --> 58:19.413
It's so much worse than that.

58:20.545 --> 58:21.459
And what?

58:22.112 --> 58:24.897
You just come back to
me for a night of guilt?

58:25.637 --> 58:26.420
Fuck you.

58:27.117 --> 58:29.206
How dare you come to me ever!

58:29.467 --> 58:30.163
Good.

58:30.642 --> 58:31.513
[panting]

58:31.774 --> 58:32.644
Good.

58:34.428 --> 58:35.604
You're still fighting.

58:36.387 --> 58:37.431
How do you feel now?

58:37.693 --> 58:38.607
Pissed off.

58:39.912 --> 58:41.958
Well, a moment ago
you could barely move.

58:43.263 --> 58:45.265
This passion will heal you.

58:46.310 --> 58:47.485
The changes is near.

58:49.879 --> 58:51.184
We need to get out of here.

58:51.837 --> 58:53.012
They'll kill us soon.

58:54.492 --> 58:55.798
That's not what they said.

58:55.972 --> 58:57.756
Well, you've seen
the pile of bodies.

58:58.583 --> 58:59.192
Jess.

59:00.106 --> 59:01.717
I don't know how
much longer I can do this.

59:03.196 --> 59:04.458
It gets worse.

59:04.633 --> 59:05.590
What the fuck
are you talking about?

59:07.636 --> 59:08.898
Where would you stop

59:10.247 --> 59:11.727
to save a loved one?

59:13.119 --> 59:13.990
A finger?

59:16.558 --> 59:17.907
A hand- Stop.

59:18.211 --> 59:19.038
Jess.

59:20.300 --> 59:22.172
You need to wake
up and get moving.

59:22.694 --> 59:24.304
Why?

59:24.478 --> 59:26.002
Because Thomas didn't
put you in your cell tonight.

59:26.524 --> 59:27.786
He's never done that for me.

59:29.266 --> 59:30.136
Or me.

59:30.920 --> 59:31.747
You could--

59:35.011 --> 59:35.707
Caleb?

59:37.666 --> 59:38.710
[CALEB] It's passion.

59:38.884 --> 59:39.929
What is it?

59:40.277 --> 59:41.104
[CALEB] Good.

59:41.495 --> 59:42.758
I-- I don't- [CALEB] Bad.

59:43.976 --> 59:45.108
[CALEB] Nothing in between.

59:47.240 --> 59:48.502
[CALEB] Sure, it's intense.

59:49.242 --> 59:50.461
[CALEB] But you can guide it.

59:51.418 --> 59:52.332
[CALEB] Control it.

59:53.769 --> 59:54.596
What's going on?

59:56.815 --> 59:58.295
He's making another one.

59:58.556 --> 01:00:00.427
[eerie music plays]

01:00:13.266 --> 01:00:14.224
[kissing]

01:00:27.716 --> 01:00:28.630
I want this.

01:00:28.804 --> 01:00:30.109
You know what that means.

01:00:30.283 --> 01:00:31.545
I want you.

01:00:37.726 --> 01:00:38.465
[gun clicks]

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:39.466
[footsteps]

01:00:43.732 --> 01:00:44.646
What did you do?

01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:46.256
Nothing! Nothing.

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:47.561
Just wait. Stop.

01:00:48.824 --> 01:00:49.825
Wait, wait, wait. Stop.

01:00:49.999 --> 01:00:50.739
It's-- it's not what you think.

01:00:53.959 --> 01:00:54.917
[grunting]

01:01:00.923 --> 01:01:02.228
[grunting]

01:01:09.758 --> 01:01:10.933
[groaning]

01:01:13.022 --> 01:01:14.588
[aggressive grunting]

01:01:33.477 --> 01:01:34.217
You okay?

01:01:35.044 --> 01:01:35.827
I will be.

01:01:37.263 --> 01:01:38.438
See to James.

01:01:38.612 --> 01:01:39.918
He shouldn't
have been so strong.

01:01:41.006 --> 01:01:41.790
It's not--

01:01:42.312 --> 01:01:43.139
The moon is even full--

01:01:43.313 --> 01:01:44.531
He was an Alpha.

01:01:45.358 --> 01:01:46.446
The rules don't apply.

01:01:47.970 --> 01:01:48.710
Move.

01:02:00.591 --> 01:02:01.984
[screaming]

01:02:48.770 --> 01:02:49.945
[footsteps]

01:03:43.607 --> 01:03:44.434
Sit.

01:03:56.228 --> 01:03:57.186
Stay.

01:04:02.582 --> 01:04:04.497
You want to be a dog so much,

01:04:05.498 --> 01:04:07.065
We'll treat you like one.

01:04:17.032 --> 01:04:18.207
[door closes]

01:04:21.297 --> 01:04:22.298
Hello, Jessica.

01:04:40.969 --> 01:04:41.752
Father.

01:04:41.926 --> 01:04:42.753
He's waiting for you.

01:04:45.495 --> 01:04:48.715
Three decades of
chasing you around the globe.

01:04:50.239 --> 01:04:52.894
I always pictured
you as more imposing.

01:04:56.549 --> 01:04:58.464
What a disappointment.

01:05:06.559 --> 01:05:08.039
We're done here.

01:05:09.432 --> 01:05:10.650
Burn the bodies.

01:05:17.657 --> 01:05:18.658
Lord God.

01:05:19.921 --> 01:05:23.011
Whose days are without end and
whose mercies are beyond
counting.

01:05:24.577 --> 01:05:25.317
Keep us mindful

01:05:25.491 --> 01:05:26.710
that life is short.

01:05:28.059 --> 01:05:30.192
And that the hour
of death is unknown.

01:05:34.805 --> 01:05:36.894
Caleb said you've
been talking to the others.

01:05:38.026 --> 01:05:39.418
That you got left out tonight.

01:05:41.899 --> 01:05:44.641
He said
that given enough trauma,

01:05:45.947 --> 01:05:46.948
even a partial moon

01:05:47.122 --> 01:05:48.645
can trigger the transformation.

01:05:51.865 --> 01:05:54.172
He had high hopes you
three would make it out.

01:05:57.306 --> 01:05:59.308
Y-you and he...?

01:06:00.483 --> 01:06:01.571
Sort of.

01:06:02.441 --> 01:06:05.053
It was.... new.

01:06:07.142 --> 01:06:08.621
I should have known better.

01:06:11.189 --> 01:06:13.061
So you didn't...?

01:06:13.235 --> 01:06:14.410
You're not..?
- No.

01:06:14.584 --> 01:06:16.064
No.
He was, um,

01:06:16.934 --> 01:06:18.066
he was interesting.

01:06:20.242 --> 01:06:21.939
For a man
made purely of passion,

01:06:22.113 --> 01:06:25.116
he was controlled.

01:06:29.642 --> 01:06:31.601
Then how am I here?

01:06:31.862 --> 01:06:33.646
Controlled doesn't mean good.

01:06:34.908 --> 01:06:36.171
He was flawed.

01:06:36.475 --> 01:06:38.260
Driven by his worst impulses.

01:06:39.609 --> 01:06:40.697
He was complicated.

01:06:43.526 --> 01:06:47.312
You, Matt, Monique, Tegan.

01:06:47.878 --> 01:06:48.748
Charlotte.

01:06:49.488 --> 01:06:50.402
Brad.

01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:53.057
Distractions.

01:06:54.667 --> 01:06:55.929
Collateral damage.

01:06:58.932 --> 01:07:00.238
Collateral damage.

01:07:01.979 --> 01:07:03.372
My entire life.

01:07:03.546 --> 01:07:04.938
He saw it as a gift.

01:07:06.984 --> 01:07:10.118
You had a fighting chance
to make it to your first moon.

01:07:10.292 --> 01:07:11.945
And if you didn't?

01:07:13.643 --> 01:07:14.644
You bought him time.

01:07:15.688 --> 01:07:17.386
That's pretty
fucking cold blooded.

01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:19.127
Well, passion.

01:07:19.605 --> 01:07:20.519
Extremes.

01:07:21.172 --> 01:07:22.434
Call it what you want.

01:07:26.656 --> 01:07:27.744
[footsteps]

01:07:27.918 --> 01:07:29.006
You better hide.

01:07:35.012 --> 01:07:36.057
[door opens]

01:07:40.974 --> 01:07:41.627
Hello, Dad.

01:07:45.675 --> 01:07:46.763
What have you done?

01:07:47.329 --> 01:07:49.026
You asked me to find him.

01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:50.984
I asked you to watch him.

01:07:51.985 --> 01:07:53.596
I told you he was corruptive.

01:07:53.770 --> 01:07:55.076
He didn't corrupt anything.

01:07:56.251 --> 01:07:57.904
Did you ever
even speak to the man?

01:08:01.038 --> 01:08:02.257
That thing

01:08:03.171 --> 01:08:04.563
is not a man.

01:08:15.966 --> 01:08:16.880
Why?

01:08:19.187 --> 01:08:20.752
Why what?

01:08:23.104 --> 01:08:24.670
Why did I question you?

01:08:25.497 --> 01:08:27.325
Why did I speak with him?

01:08:27.499 --> 01:08:29.327
Why did I bother to look close

01:08:29.501 --> 01:08:31.372
and see the
good and the compassion

01:08:31.546 --> 01:08:33.201
and the love in someone that

01:08:33.375 --> 01:08:35.420
you've dedicated
your life to hunting?

01:08:37.727 --> 01:08:38.596
Ah.

01:08:39.859 --> 01:08:41.992
Why did I disobey you?

01:08:42.558 --> 01:08:44.647
Because you are wrong.

01:08:46.170 --> 01:08:48.912
Holy water didn't burn his skin
any more than it does yours.

01:08:49.086 --> 01:08:50.870
He was not evil.

01:08:51.871 --> 01:08:53.176
He was a man of passion.

01:08:53.350 --> 01:08:55.919
And you attacked,
attacked and attacked.

01:08:56.093 --> 01:08:57.921
No matter how far he ran.

01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:09.801
We are the monsters, Father.

01:09:10.803 --> 01:09:12.153
We create them.

01:09:12.327 --> 01:09:13.979
It's not the other way around.

01:09:20.335 --> 01:09:21.162
He's...

01:09:21.423 --> 01:09:23.381
He's taken so much from me.

01:09:23.859 --> 01:09:24.469
What?

01:09:24.904 --> 01:09:26.167
Dad?

01:09:27.733 --> 01:09:29.648
What irreplaceable thing?

01:09:29.822 --> 01:09:33.435
could he have taken so
as to justify all this rage?

01:09:41.877 --> 01:09:42.879
My only son.

01:09:43.053 --> 01:09:43.923
[gunshot]

01:09:45.185 --> 01:09:46.187
[gasping]

01:09:48.841 --> 01:09:50.365
[laboured breathing]

01:09:53.106 --> 01:09:54.543
[groaning]

01:10:02.290 --> 01:10:03.378
[gasping]

01:10:35.975 --> 01:10:36.802
Father.

01:10:36.976 --> 01:10:37.847
Father what happened--

01:10:38.021 --> 01:10:39.327
Where are the cursed ones?

01:10:39.501 --> 01:10:40.415
Monique and
Jessica are in their rooms

01:10:40.589 --> 01:10:41.459
and Matthew is in a treatment.

01:10:41.633 --> 01:10:42.068
Move.

01:10:47.030 --> 01:10:48.249
[panting]

01:11:05.744 --> 01:11:06.832
[groaning]

01:11:13.099 --> 01:11:14.057
Okay.

01:11:16.407 --> 01:11:17.278
You all right?

01:11:17.974 --> 01:11:18.583
[coughs]

01:11:21.238 --> 01:11:21.804
Hey.

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:28.419
How long

01:11:28.593 --> 01:11:30.595
do you expect me
to keep doing this?

01:11:33.598 --> 01:11:34.686
It's okay.

01:11:35.296 --> 01:11:37.298
Just save your strength.

01:11:40.518 --> 01:11:41.693
[grunting]

01:11:41.911 --> 01:11:42.651
Why?

01:11:44.174 --> 01:11:45.958
So I can die on my feet?

01:11:50.006 --> 01:11:51.616
I don't want you to die at all.

01:11:53.444 --> 01:11:55.054
But we have to get
this thing out of you.

01:11:57.448 --> 01:11:58.449
Have you ever?

01:12:00.103 --> 01:12:01.409
You've been doing this a while.

01:12:04.412 --> 01:12:05.282
Yeah, years.

01:12:07.371 --> 01:12:08.807
After all this time,

01:12:10.505 --> 01:12:11.636
how many bodies?

01:12:17.033 --> 01:12:18.774
How many of us victims?

01:12:19.165 --> 01:12:20.515
Have you actually saved?

01:12:22.299 --> 01:12:23.431
[grunts]

01:12:25.215 --> 01:12:26.085
One.

01:12:28.131 --> 01:12:29.175
Out of?

01:12:31.482 --> 01:12:32.353
A lot.

01:12:35.443 --> 01:12:36.705
Because whenever we get close,

01:12:38.402 --> 01:12:40.448
this monster
infects more people.

01:12:41.318 --> 01:12:43.233
And he throws
them out into the world.

01:12:45.104 --> 01:12:46.410
It's people like you.

01:12:47.542 --> 01:12:50.675
He uses innocent
people as a smokescreen.

01:12:51.197 --> 01:12:54.549
And then we spend our
time cleaning up his mess

01:12:55.071 --> 01:12:56.377
instead of finding him.

01:13:00.729 --> 01:13:02.861
We are trying to save you.

01:13:05.386 --> 01:13:06.822
Try saving yourself.

01:13:06.996 --> 01:13:07.910
Brother.

01:13:09.999 --> 01:13:11.914
The punishment for sin

01:13:12.131 --> 01:13:13.263
is death.

01:13:13.872 --> 01:13:15.134
So they say.

01:13:18.094 --> 01:13:19.225
Has he repented?

01:13:20.226 --> 01:13:22.141
I don't think it's--

01:13:22.315 --> 01:13:24.709
Has this monster prostrated
himself on the altar of
the Lord?

01:13:24.883 --> 01:13:26.929
Father, it
has been a long session--

01:13:27.495 --> 01:13:28.321
[yelling]

01:13:31.412 --> 01:13:32.891
Is this what you
wanted you piece of shit?

01:13:33.065 --> 01:13:33.631
Huh?

01:13:34.937 --> 01:13:36.373
You want your pound of flesh?

01:13:39.115 --> 01:13:39.768
Take it.

01:13:39.942 --> 01:13:41.073
Take it then!

01:13:41.770 --> 01:13:43.772
This is the rage you think
doesn't make you a monster!

01:13:44.250 --> 01:13:45.730
It's the passion you believe--

01:13:45.904 --> 01:13:47.253
[Jess gasps]

01:13:51.301 --> 01:13:52.868
I guess it's just
the two of you now.

01:13:53.042 --> 01:13:54.260
[Torquemada yelling]

01:13:54.826 --> 01:13:56.349
You take what you
want when you want!

01:13:58.221 --> 01:13:59.440
I'm so sorry.

01:13:59.744 --> 01:14:01.224
[TORQUEMADA] You
destroy lives so casually!

01:14:03.052 --> 01:14:05.446
Ask God to judge you himself!

01:14:14.672 --> 01:14:15.847
[screams]

01:14:36.259 --> 01:14:37.739
The other two.

01:14:38.783 --> 01:14:40.263
Give them one last session.

01:14:41.656 --> 01:14:44.093
One last chance
to know God's mercy.

01:14:45.877 --> 01:14:47.009
If they don't.

01:14:49.794 --> 01:14:51.492
I'll put the
mongrels down myself.

01:14:53.363 --> 01:14:54.407
We-- we do still have to--

01:14:54.582 --> 01:14:55.800
GO!

01:15:11.337 --> 01:15:13.514
[panting]

01:15:30.182 --> 01:15:31.183
[footsteps]

01:15:32.097 --> 01:15:32.968
Jessica?

01:15:33.969 --> 01:15:34.883
[JESSICA] Hi.

01:15:35.753 --> 01:15:36.885
[THOMAS] You
don't need to be in the--

01:15:37.059 --> 01:15:38.408
I felt wrong outside.

01:15:39.278 --> 01:15:40.802
Scared I wasn't in control.

01:15:45.981 --> 01:15:46.895
Jessica.

01:15:48.984 --> 01:15:50.681
You and I are about
to go through something.

01:15:53.423 --> 01:15:54.685
I need to treat you.

01:15:56.426 --> 01:15:58.733
I know it's
complicated between us but...

01:15:59.995 --> 01:16:00.735
I need to do it.

01:16:00.909 --> 01:16:02.127
And I need to do it now.

01:16:05.348 --> 01:16:08.351
And I need you to
give yourself to God.

01:16:10.179 --> 01:16:11.267
Wholeheartedly.

01:16:13.182 --> 01:16:14.313
I understand.

01:16:18.187 --> 01:16:19.057
[grunting]

01:16:19.928 --> 01:16:20.842
[intense music]

01:16:22.757 --> 01:16:23.627
[struggling]

01:16:26.325 --> 01:16:27.239
[gasping]

01:16:29.807 --> 01:16:30.895
[Jess screams]

01:16:32.767 --> 01:16:34.159
[groaning]

01:16:37.598 --> 01:16:38.990
Blessed are you
Lord, all powerful God,

01:16:39.164 --> 01:16:41.166
Who in Christ,
the living water of salvation,

01:16:41.340 --> 01:16:42.777
blessed and transformed us.

01:16:44.779 --> 01:16:46.519
Grant that when we are
sprinkled with this water

01:16:46.694 --> 01:16:48.521
and make use of it,

01:16:48.696 --> 01:16:49.914
we will be refreshed inwardly
by the power of the Holy Spirit

01:16:50.088 --> 01:16:51.089
and continue to walk

01:16:51.699 --> 01:16:53.614
the new life we
received in baptism.

01:16:55.267 --> 01:16:57.008
We ask this
through Christ our Lord.

01:16:57.922 --> 01:16:58.662
Amen.

01:16:59.445 --> 01:17:00.359
[choking]

01:17:03.536 --> 01:17:04.450
[struggling]

01:17:05.016 --> 01:17:06.017
No please!

01:17:06.235 --> 01:17:07.889
Please!
No, no, no.

01:17:13.111 --> 01:17:15.766
You're asking for
help in the wrong places.

01:17:15.940 --> 01:17:17.550
No no no no, please.

01:17:25.558 --> 01:17:26.472
NO!

01:17:39.703 --> 01:17:40.356
Come.

01:17:40.878 --> 01:17:41.879
Let's go. Come.

01:17:44.621 --> 01:17:46.667
I see you!

01:17:57.982 --> 01:17:58.679
[THOMAS] Jessica!

01:17:59.810 --> 01:18:01.333
[THOMAS] Jessica! Wait!

01:18:02.987 --> 01:18:04.162
[THOMAS] Just wait, Jessica!

01:18:04.336 --> 01:18:05.337
[grunting]

01:18:06.512 --> 01:18:07.862
[THOMAS] You cannot break!

01:18:09.690 --> 01:18:10.516
[THOMAS] Jessica!

01:18:11.082 --> 01:18:11.822
[gunshot]

01:18:11.996 --> 01:18:13.432
I don't want to do this!

01:18:17.959 --> 01:18:21.440
Do not make me do this.

01:18:24.095 --> 01:18:25.053
Jessica...

01:18:26.576 --> 01:18:27.359
Please.

01:18:28.404 --> 01:18:31.494
You and I, we
can work through this.

01:18:32.277 --> 01:18:33.061
Okay?

01:18:33.844 --> 01:18:35.846
I am trying to help you.

01:18:36.586 --> 01:18:37.718
Work through this?

01:18:39.632 --> 01:18:41.722
You mean endure torture to that

01:18:41.896 --> 01:18:43.158
psychopath--

01:18:43.332 --> 01:18:45.116
He is not a psychopath!

01:18:46.030 --> 01:18:47.336
He is a good man.

01:18:49.686 --> 01:18:51.557
I saw him beat Matt to death.

01:18:55.170 --> 01:18:56.345
This is...

01:18:56.519 --> 01:18:58.434
What we're doing
here is complicated.

01:19:00.131 --> 01:19:02.133
He killed his own son.

01:19:02.307 --> 01:19:03.004
What?

01:19:04.135 --> 01:19:04.962
What?

01:19:07.356 --> 01:19:08.313
I saw him.

01:19:09.619 --> 01:19:11.839
He-- He shot him in his office.

01:19:13.362 --> 01:19:13.971
No.

01:19:14.580 --> 01:19:15.320
No.

01:19:16.191 --> 01:19:17.366
You're a liar.

01:19:17.540 --> 01:19:19.324
He would never do that!

01:19:19.803 --> 01:19:20.412
Scott.

01:19:20.586 --> 01:19:21.762
Scott had been

01:19:21.936 --> 01:19:22.414
with Caleb
before he died- No.

01:19:22.763 --> 01:19:23.589
You're lying.

01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:26.636
Father Torquemada
couldn't accept it but...

01:19:26.810 --> 01:19:29.160
Thomas. Thomas,
I'm begging you.

01:19:29.508 --> 01:19:30.945
This has got out of control.

01:19:33.295 --> 01:19:34.775
You couldn't save her.

01:19:37.125 --> 01:19:38.387
But you could save us.

01:19:38.561 --> 01:19:40.041
Okay, I need you to stop.

01:19:40.650 --> 01:19:41.129
Hey.

01:19:49.224 --> 01:19:50.181
God dammit,

01:19:50.355 --> 01:19:51.313
I said stop!

01:19:51.487 --> 01:19:52.183
[gunshot]

01:19:53.968 --> 01:19:55.012
[whimpering]

01:20:13.770 --> 01:20:15.772
Jess. You
need to move.

01:20:17.948 --> 01:20:18.514
No.

01:20:19.210 --> 01:20:20.342
No more running.

01:20:23.562 --> 01:20:24.563
[gunshot]

01:20:28.524 --> 01:20:29.786
[SCOTT] Given enough trauma...

01:20:30.395 --> 01:20:32.441
Even a partial moon can
trigger the transformation...

01:20:33.529 --> 01:20:34.486
[Thomas yells]

01:20:36.532 --> 01:20:38.447
[sobbing] What did I do...

01:20:41.580 --> 01:20:42.886
I killed her.

01:20:43.756 --> 01:20:45.193

[MARCUS] Brother Thomas.

01:20:59.163 --> 01:21:01.035
[THOMAS] What
did you make me do?

01:21:01.209 --> 01:21:02.079
It's okay.

01:21:02.514 --> 01:21:03.254
It's me.

01:21:04.429 --> 01:21:05.430
I killed her...

01:21:06.475 --> 01:21:07.258
Them?
Monique.

01:21:08.825 --> 01:21:10.087
Brother Thomas, please.

01:21:12.307 --> 01:21:13.395
Where is Jessica?
- She...

01:21:16.833 --> 01:21:17.834
[screaming]

01:21:21.882 --> 01:21:23.405
We've got to get back inside.

01:23:45.155 --> 01:23:46.330
Thomas, we need to--

01:23:51.292 --> 01:23:52.510
No, no.

01:23:54.338 --> 01:23:56.036
Damn you to Hell, Thomas!

01:24:06.785 --> 01:24:09.788
[growling, gasping]

01:24:28.111 --> 01:24:29.286
[Torquemada yells]

01:24:39.905 --> 01:24:41.385
[growling]

01:24:56.618 --> 01:24:58.054
[roaring]

01:25:01.013 --> 01:25:02.624
[bones cracking]

01:25:03.407 --> 01:25:04.452
[unnatural roaring]

01:25:16.246 --> 01:25:17.813
[spine crunching]

01:25:25.908 --> 01:25:27.170
[shirt ripping]

01:25:48.539 --> 01:25:50.715
This is Father Torquemada
of The Order of the Waning Moon

01:25:50.889 --> 01:25:51.890
We are compromised.

01:25:52.064 --> 01:25:53.718
I repeat, we are compromised.

01:25:54.589 --> 01:25:56.025
[thudding]

01:25:59.724 --> 01:26:01.552
[monster roaring]

01:26:07.079 --> 01:26:09.038
[ferocious roaring]

01:26:19.091 --> 01:26:20.658
I knew you were lost.

01:26:22.007 --> 01:26:24.401
Your failing was
always your morality.

01:26:26.055 --> 01:26:27.883
You thought it was enough
to stay in the passenger seat

01:26:28.057 --> 01:26:28.971
on the way to Hell.

01:26:29.145 --> 01:26:30.233
Blaming others. [growling]

01:26:30.625 --> 01:26:32.714
Never taking
control of your choices.

01:26:33.889 --> 01:26:35.325
People like you make me sick--

01:26:35.499 --> 01:26:36.544
[screaming]

01:26:41.853 --> 01:26:43.507
There are more
people like me coming.

01:26:44.856 --> 01:26:46.206
My Brothers in other cities.

01:26:47.207 --> 01:26:48.164
In other countries.

01:26:50.166 --> 01:26:52.212
You are never gonna be safe.

01:26:56.477 --> 01:26:58.827
There's some actions
which others may consider a sin.

01:26:59.610 --> 01:27:01.090
But perhaps the
Father will look kindly on me

01:27:01.264 --> 01:27:03.310
for taking my son
before he could be turned.

01:27:03.962 --> 01:27:06.226
And that God
will forgive my trespasses

01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:08.489
for denying you one last meal.

01:27:09.359 --> 01:27:10.926
[bone snapping] [screaming]

01:27:13.929 --> 01:27:15.060
[screaming]

01:27:28.900 --> 01:27:30.206
[growling]

01:27:36.081 --> 01:27:37.257
[screaming]

01:28:08.331 --> 01:28:09.158
[gasping]

01:28:09.332 --> 01:28:10.594
[JAMES] Brother Thomas!

01:28:10.812 --> 01:28:11.465
Brother Thomas!

01:28:11.639 --> 01:28:12.248
[growling]

01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:13.554
[screaming]

01:28:16.078 --> 01:28:17.427
[roaring]

01:28:25.566 --> 01:28:27.089
Oh my God!

01:28:31.789 --> 01:28:33.748
[sobbing] Oh my God...

01:28:34.618 --> 01:28:35.706
[growling]

01:28:37.491 --> 01:28:38.405
Please.

01:28:42.539 --> 01:28:43.366
I don't--

01:28:47.196 --> 01:28:48.066
Please.

01:28:49.154 --> 01:28:50.591
Please don't kill me.

01:28:50.765 --> 01:28:52.070
[shrieking, crunching]

01:28:54.116 --> 01:28:55.335
Don't kill you?

01:28:56.901 --> 01:28:58.120
Like you didn't kill Monique?

01:29:00.165 --> 01:29:01.166
Or Matt.

01:29:03.299 --> 01:29:04.431
Or Kate.

01:29:04.605 --> 01:29:05.997
Or Tegan or Alex.

01:29:07.390 --> 01:29:09.305
Or any of the
other countless others

01:29:09.479 --> 01:29:11.307
that I saw on
that pile of bodies.

01:29:12.308 --> 01:29:13.527
[THOMAS] I'm sorry...

01:29:14.745 --> 01:29:15.964
But Jessica,

01:29:16.138 --> 01:29:17.487
look at yourself.

01:29:17.792 --> 01:29:19.533
You are covered in blood.

01:29:20.098 --> 01:29:22.840
How many people
have you killed already?

01:29:23.014 --> 01:29:23.972
You left me no other choice.

01:29:24.146 --> 01:29:26.061
You chose to come back inside.

01:29:26.235 --> 01:29:27.628
You wanted revenge.

01:29:27.802 --> 01:29:29.369
You could have run.

01:29:30.021 --> 01:29:31.414
And ended up like Caleb?

01:29:31.762 --> 01:29:33.503
Hunted by you
and yours for decades!

01:29:33.677 --> 01:29:34.939
That's just it.

01:29:36.376 --> 01:29:38.900
How long before you
become just like him?

01:29:39.074 --> 01:29:41.163
He didn't think
he was a bad person.

01:29:41.337 --> 01:29:43.383
He didn't think he was hurting
people. These are people just
like you.

01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:49.040
I am so sorry about
what happened to you.

01:29:49.214 --> 01:29:51.478
I had hoped I could save you.

01:29:51.652 --> 01:29:52.217
Stop! I--

01:29:55.307 --> 01:29:57.048
You disgust me.

01:29:58.398 --> 01:30:00.138
You told me I was a monster.

01:30:03.359 --> 01:30:05.361
Monique told me I
was gifted with passion.

01:30:06.841 --> 01:30:08.364
None of you know shit!

01:30:08.538 --> 01:30:10.061
You don't know how this feels.

01:30:10.235 --> 01:30:11.411
I know that God--

01:30:13.064 --> 01:30:14.065
[whimpering]

01:30:31.474 --> 01:30:32.823
This new life.

01:30:34.434 --> 01:30:36.000
It's intoxicating.

01:30:37.872 --> 01:30:38.699
You wouldn't believe

01:30:38.873 --> 01:30:40.527
the colors I can see in.

01:30:42.616 --> 01:30:43.399
The smells

01:30:43.573 --> 01:30:44.922
I can see in.

01:30:46.315 --> 01:30:48.448
I can trace the
line of your pheromones.

01:30:50.798 --> 01:30:52.495
I can walk
through your memories.

01:30:55.629 --> 01:30:57.892
I can see that girl
you won't shut up about.

01:31:00.590 --> 01:31:02.200
I can see you getting high.

01:31:04.551 --> 01:31:05.639
Now tell me.

01:31:08.076 --> 01:31:09.556
Did you ever see her body?

01:31:10.165 --> 01:31:11.775
Read that police report?

01:31:13.255 --> 01:31:14.343
Or did Torquemada kill her

01:31:14.517 --> 01:31:16.084
and tell you what happened?

01:31:17.868 --> 01:31:19.609
N--no, no.

01:31:19.783 --> 01:31:20.958
You poor little follower boy.

01:31:21.132 --> 01:31:22.394
You believed him.

01:31:26.224 --> 01:31:28.357
Or am I just
fucking with you now?

01:31:32.883 --> 01:31:34.450
I can see you.

01:31:36.017 --> 01:31:37.105
Your fear.

01:31:37.671 --> 01:31:40.195
Your lust. It all
has a specific scent.

01:31:42.937 --> 01:31:44.547
And if I wanted to,

01:31:46.157 --> 01:31:48.377
I could find you anywhere.

01:31:50.118 --> 01:31:51.249
And I will.

01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:55.471
If you come for me

01:31:56.037 --> 01:31:59.388
I will find you
and I will consume you.

01:32:00.258 --> 01:32:01.521
Yeah, you see?

01:32:01.956 --> 01:32:04.262
How easy that threat came!

01:32:05.437 --> 01:32:08.440
How long before you
start infecting people?

01:32:09.354 --> 01:32:12.793
How long before you
become worse than him?

01:32:14.272 --> 01:32:16.013
Jessica?

01:32:16.492 --> 01:32:18.233
You have to be stopped.

01:32:19.582 --> 01:32:21.149
Don't follow me.

01:32:27.285 --> 01:32:28.548
[sobbing]

01:32:38.601 --> 01:32:39.820

01:32:59.796 --> 01:33:01.058
[TRISTAN] My God.

01:33:01.406 --> 01:33:02.930
I hate catching busses at night.

01:33:03.887 --> 01:33:05.019
There's never enough light.

01:33:08.892 --> 01:33:09.893
Dostoevsky

01:33:11.199 --> 01:33:13.375
Going for some heavy reading?

01:33:15.377 --> 01:33:16.596
It's a passion.

01:33:16.987 --> 01:33:19.076
It's a dry, dusty passion.

01:33:20.251 --> 01:33:21.296
But, uh,

01:33:21.775 --> 01:33:23.211
you don't get to choose right?

01:33:25.605 --> 01:33:26.344
No.

01:33:27.476 --> 01:33:28.695
No, you don't.

01:33:34.048 --> 01:33:36.006
[suspenseful music]

01:33:38.966 --> 01:33:40.141
[distant thunder]

01:33:41.403 --> 01:33:42.926
[heavy metal music plays]

01:33:53.415 --> 01:33:54.851
[bulbs buzzing]
