Is that why you chose insurance?

11:08.144 --> 11:09.979
Well, I...

11:10.980 --> 11:13.942
think that being a paramedic
is really important work.

11:14.776 --> 11:15.860
And...

11:17.112 --> 11:19.029
in all honesty, I got into EMS

11:19.030 --> 11:21.365

to help people.

11:23.660 --> 11:25.911
we hardly ever help anybody.

"Fuck everybody."

11:58.945 --> 12:00.529
And given the opportunity,

12:00.530 --> 12:02.698
I would set fire
to that ambulance.

12:02.699 --> 12:04.950
Because it's broken, Bruce.

12:04.951 --> 12:08.829

Man, I hope
he's wearing clothes today.

18:32.464 --> 18:34.965
You know something?
I bet ya he's not.

18:34.966 --> 18:37.259
Matter of fact, 20 bucks say
he's gonna be butt-ass naked.

18:37.260 --> 18:39.219
- Oh, no way.
- Twenty dollars.

18:39.220 --> 18:40.263
- Bet you right now.
- I'm in.

18:40.889 --> 18:42.222
You're payin' for my lunch today

18:42.223 --> 18:43.515
'cause he gon' be
fuckin' butt-ass naked.

18:43.516 --> 18:44.558
- Let's do this.
- Let's do it.

18:44.559 --> 18:46.226
- Come on, big money.
- Okay.

18:46.227 --> 18:48.187
Hey, student of the year,
what do you think? You in?

18:48.188 --> 18:50.606
- Balls in or out?
- Balls?

18:50.607 --> 18:53.068
[funky upbeat music playing]

18:55.362 --> 18:56.862
[timer clicking]

18:56.863 --> 18:59.073
[Johnny yelling]

18:59.074 --> 19:02.284
I am Satan
and his only messenger!

19:02.285 --> 19:04.578
Well, there you have it.
It's a draw.

19:04.579 --> 19:05.914
Shirt, no pants.

19:06.664 --> 19:08.540
What are you talkin' 'bout?
That's bullshit, okay?

19:08.541 --> 19:10.417
I can see his dick.
That qualifies.

19:10.418 --> 19:11.585
[Randy] He's not naked!

19:11.586 --> 19:13.879
How'd you call that naked?
He's wearing a shirt.

19:13.880 --> 19:16.673
Shirt, no pants. That's like,
uh... Winnie the Pooh.

19:16.674 --> 19:18.175
I guess Winnie the Pooh
got his dick out

19:18.176 --> 19:20.178
because I can see
Winnie the Pooh's dick.

19:20.303 --> 19:22.096
Johnny, bring your naked ass
over here!

19:22.097 --> 19:24.223
Leave this place...

19:24.224 --> 19:26.058
or I'll destroy you all!

19:26.059 --> 19:28.936
Oh, oh. Okay, so you really
wanna test your immortality?

19:28.937 --> 19:31.063
- Okay.
- Leave now!

19:31.064 --> 19:33.817
- [engine revving]
- [tires screeching]

19:34.651 --> 19:36.819
[window mechanism whirring]

19:36.820 --> 19:39.613
I am Satan
and his only messenger.

19:39.614 --> 19:42.074
Man, that's greedy as fuck.
You cannot be Satan

19:42.075 --> 19:43.701
<i>and</i> his only messenger.

19:43.702 --> 19:46.079
Just pick one, okay?
Got too many fuckin' jobs!

19:47.288 --> 19:49.623
I am Satan
and his only messenger!

19:49.624 --> 19:51.083
Okay. You know what?

19:51.084 --> 19:53.168
Have some breakfast. But...

19:53.169 --> 19:55.254
leave people alone.
Lay low. Okay?

19:55.255 --> 19:57.715
Or I'm gonna hook the
defibrillator up to your face.

19:57.716 --> 19:59.049
Bzz! You understand?

19:59.050 --> 20:00.968
It don't matter.
Put some fuckin' pants on

20:00.969 --> 20:02.761
and get your ashy
leprechaun ass from over here.

20:02.762 --> 20:03.930
Nobody wanna see that shit!

20:04.597 --> 20:05.598
Satan does!

20:06.391 --> 20:07.517
What...

20:08.810 --> 20:10.102
[Randy] County, it's Medic 42.

20:10.103 --> 20:12.271
We are available.
No patient on scene.

20:12.272 --> 20:13.897
Repeat, no patient on scene.

20:13.898 --> 20:15.858
Wait. What are you doing?
You abandoned your patient.

20:15.859 --> 20:17.359
You could lose your license.

20:17.360 --> 20:19.486
- [Johnny] Satan loves me!
- That is not a patient.

20:19.487 --> 20:20.738
That is Johnny.

20:20.739 --> 20:22.114
If he was actively schizo,

20:22.115 --> 20:23.282
he'd be pulling out his hair

20:23.283 --> 20:25.159
and biting his lips
until they bleed.

20:25.160 --> 20:27.661
That's what Johnny does
when he's not on his meds.

20:27.662 --> 20:30.915
Right now, Johnny's acting
this way because he's hungry.

20:31.541 --> 20:32.833
- Oh, he's hungry. Yeah.
- Yes.

20:32.834 --> 20:34.877
The guy wagging his dick around.

20:34.878 --> 20:36.545
- Yeah.
- That-- He's hungry.

20:36.546 --> 20:38.505
[Randy] He wants us to take him
into the ER

20:38.506 --> 20:41.008
where they have to give him
a meal before they let him go,

20:41.009 --> 20:43.052
because the ER has no choice.

20:43.053 --> 20:46.138
They legally
can't turn anyone away.

20:46.139 --> 20:49.016
Now, we could bring him in
for his ER happy meal,

20:49.017 --> 20:51.518
but guess what? There's a
shit-ton of paperwork involved.

20:51.519 --> 20:53.729
So it's a lot easier for me
to skip the middleman

20:53.730 --> 20:56.315
and give him my breakfast.
And I'm starving!

20:56.316 --> 20:58.817
Okay. So just to recap.

20:58.818 --> 21:01.613
Your medical solution
is muffins.

21:03.156 --> 21:05.866
I sacrificed
my delicious muffins

21:05.867 --> 21:07.035
for the good of humanity.

21:08.119 --> 21:10.205
- Mike, let's roll.
- Alright. We outta here.

21:14.501 --> 21:16.126
[indistinct radio chatter]

21:16.127 --> 21:17.337
Why are you here?

21:18.797 --> 21:20.214
Because I wanna save lives.

21:20.215 --> 21:21.924
[both laugh]

21:21.925 --> 21:24.301
- Is that funny?
- You wanna save lives.

21:24.302 --> 21:25.677
You think we savin' lives?

21:25.678 --> 21:27.429
Come on, now.
We just gave a dude muffins.

21:27.430 --> 21:29.306
Yeah, I used to want
to be a hero,

21:29.307 --> 21:32.351
but the fact is,
we're not heroes.

21:32.352 --> 21:33.602
Okay?

21:33.603 --> 21:35.979
The fact is that
most of the calls we get

21:35.980 --> 21:37.231
are bullshit.

21:37.232 --> 21:38.482
The people that need us
don't call,

21:38.483 --> 21:40.484
and the people that call
don't need us.

21:40.485 --> 21:42.111
People live, people die.

21:42.112 --> 21:45.072
You rarely make any kind
of difference whatsoever.

21:45.073 --> 21:46.240
This is a job.

21:46.241 --> 21:49.284
Okay? You clock in,
you clock out.

21:49.285 --> 21:51.453
At the end of the day
you go home. That's it.

21:51.454 --> 21:53.038
I don't think
you really believe that.

21:53.039 --> 21:54.665
No, I do.

21:54.666 --> 21:57.042
I do. I really, really do.

21:57.043 --> 21:58.752
And you should too
if you want to last.

21:58.753 --> 22:01.130
But you have people's lives
in your hands.

22:01.131 --> 22:03.549
How can you not care?
How can you not give a shit?

22:03.550 --> 22:04.759
Caring is what kills you.

22:05.427 --> 22:06.719
[Randy] The fact is,

22:06.720 --> 22:09.012
most people in this job
can't last a year.

22:09.013 --> 22:10.305
They can't hack it.

22:10.306 --> 22:12.349
And the good ones,
the really, really good ones?

22:12.350 --> 22:13.642
Five years.

22:13.643 --> 22:15.478
Five years, max.
That's all they can handle.

22:17.981 --> 22:19.441
How long have you been doing it?

22:20.150 --> 22:21.942
[siren wailing]

22:21.943 --> 22:24.403
Eighteen years, nine months.

22:24.404 --> 22:26.865
[dramatic music playing]

22:33.455 --> 22:34.663
Alright, class president,

22:34.664 --> 22:36.082
this one's for real,
so pay attention.

22:36.833 --> 22:38.208
You're with me. Grab the bag.

22:38.209 --> 22:39.626
- Okay.
- Don't touch anything.

22:39.627 --> 22:40.544
Nothing. Got it?

22:40.545 --> 22:41.879
But then why am I...

22:41.880 --> 22:43.506
[scoffs] ...even here?

22:46.551 --> 22:48.803
[commotion]

22:49.304 --> 22:51.430
Walk. Don't run. Never run.

22:51.431 --> 22:52.806
- [Jessica] Why?
- Why?

22:52.807 --> 22:54.476
Oh, shit. Door's stuck.

22:56.811 --> 22:58.896
- BSI.
- What?

22:58.897 --> 23:00.147
- BSI!
- What the fuck is that?

23:00.148 --> 23:01.732
- Put your gloves on!
- Oh. Okay.

23:01.733 --> 23:03.400
- [Randy] Hey, Jimmy.
- Hey.

23:03.401 --> 23:04.985
[Randy] Need you
to pop that door.

23:04.986 --> 23:07.321
- [Jimmy] Got it.
- Also need an additional driver.

23:07.322 --> 23:08.739
I need Mike in the back with me.

23:08.740 --> 23:11.117
- [Jimmy] We're on it.
- Hey. Everything's okay?

23:12.577 --> 23:13.660
What is that?

23:13.661 --> 23:16.039
I answer questions
after the fact.

23:18.124 --> 23:19.249
[shatters loudly]

23:19.250 --> 23:20.668
It's a window punch.

23:22.837 --> 23:23.879
[fireman] Okay, go ahead.

23:23.880 --> 23:25.089
Pull her out the side.

23:25.090 --> 23:26.383
- Move in.
- Little more.

23:28.301 --> 23:29.885
[Randy] Alright,
head of her class,

23:29.886 --> 23:31.011
what do we assess first?

23:31.012 --> 23:32.805
Airway, breathing, circulation.

23:32.806 --> 23:34.723
He's breathing,
but it's rapid deep breaths.

23:34.724 --> 23:36.267
Kussmauls?

23:36.726 --> 23:38.268
Wait, am I right?

23:38.269 --> 23:39.854
[Mike] Rookie, get out the way.

23:40.438 --> 23:41.647
What's goin' on here?

23:41.648 --> 23:43.440
Got Kussmauls.

23:43.441 --> 23:46.151
Possible broken everything.
What about you?

23:46.152 --> 23:48.070
Lady was just a little shook up
but she's alright.

23:48.071 --> 23:49.863
Alright. Grab me a collar,
will ya?

23:49.864 --> 23:51.490
Okay, I got you.

23:51.491 --> 23:52.992
- Get out the way.
- Sorry. Sorry.

23:53.868 --> 23:55.077
[saw buzzing]

23:55.078 --> 23:56.787
Alright, and grab me
a non-rebreather.

23:56.788 --> 23:58.664
You just said
not to touch anything.

23:58.665 --> 24:00.958
And now I'm asking you to touch
a non-rebreather

24:00.959 --> 24:02.209
and bring it to me.

24:02.210 --> 24:04.170
Wait. No. No.

24:05.213 --> 24:07.297
[splutters] Sorry. Sorry.

24:07.298 --> 24:08.966
Not in the truck. In the bag!

24:08.967 --> 24:11.301
- The what?
- In the bag! In the bag!

24:11.302 --> 24:12.720
Oh, shit.

24:12.721 --> 24:14.180
Walk. Don't run.

24:17.100 --> 24:18.685
Hey, buddy. Can you hear me?

24:21.938 --> 24:23.564
[fireman] One, two, three.

24:23.565 --> 24:24.899
[groans]

24:25.608 --> 24:27.067
One, two, three.

24:27.068 --> 24:29.236
No. Yeah, I got him.

24:29.237 --> 24:31.071
- [monitor beeping steadily]
- How am I doin'?

24:31.072 --> 24:32.114
Alright.

24:32.115 --> 24:34.158
Nothing in the belly,
good in all four.

24:34.159 --> 24:35.702
Got this, hero?

24:36.578 --> 24:37.578
[beeping rapidly]

24:37.579 --> 24:39.581
Oh, shit. He's in V-fib.

24:40.498 --> 24:41.999
You, I need you to do CPR.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.835
Now. Go. Go!

24:47.797 --> 24:49.882
[monitor beeping rapidly]

24:49.883 --> 24:50.967
Harder.

24:51.885 --> 24:53.385
Harder!
You're not doing anything.

24:53.386 --> 24:54.636
- Harder!
- [crunching]

24:54.637 --> 24:56.638
Oh, God! I think
I just broke his ribs.

24:56.639 --> 24:58.390
No, no, no. That's a good thing.
A good thing.

24:58.391 --> 25:00.184
Don't stop, okay?
Means you're doing it right.

25:00.185 --> 25:02.354
Yeah. I can fix broken.
I can't fix dead.

25:03.104 --> 25:04.146
Come on!

25:04.147 --> 25:06.399
[siren wailing]

25:07.692 --> 25:10.819
[dramatic music continues]

25:10.820 --> 25:12.155
Um, are we gonna shock him?

25:12.697 --> 25:14.156
No, we gonna wax his chest.

25:14.157 --> 25:15.616
Yes, we gonna shock him.

25:15.617 --> 25:16.867
[Randy] Charging.

25:16.868 --> 25:18.827
- [defibrillator tone whirring]
- Clear.

25:18.828 --> 25:21.121
Brainiac is clear. All clear.

25:21.122 --> 25:22.998
- [beep]
- [flatline tone]

25:22.999 --> 25:25.752
[siren wailing]

25:29.672 --> 25:31.090
Comin' through.

25:31.091 --> 25:32.925
Hello? Hello, hello!

25:32.926 --> 25:36.637
Got approximately 40-year-old
male, two-car MVA.

25:36.638 --> 25:38.514
Restrained driver.

25:38.515 --> 25:40.183
Severe damage to the vehicle.

25:41.101 --> 25:42.686
Ten-minute extrication.

25:43.395 --> 25:44.895
Kussmauls at first,

25:44.896 --> 25:47.773
but once we got him out
went apneic and V-fib.

25:47.774 --> 25:50.150
Been shocked three times.
Last was on the drive here.

25:50.151 --> 25:51.151
Now asystolic.

25:51.152 --> 25:53.487
Ready? One, two, three.

25:53.488 --> 25:54.698
[grunting]

25:56.157 --> 25:57.866
Pupils are fixed and dilated.

25:57.867 --> 26:00.369
Fractured right arm and
depressed skull fracture in--

26:00.370 --> 26:03.205
Hold compression.
Just hold, hold, hold. Please.

26:03.206 --> 26:04.541
He's asystolic.

26:05.625 --> 26:07.918
You said he was traumatic.
Did you ever get a pulse back?

26:07.919 --> 26:09.128
- No.
- No.

26:09.129 --> 26:10.338
No.

26:10.755 --> 26:13.799
[sighs] Time of death, 10:29.

26:13.800 --> 26:16.093
Oh, God.
You gotta be shitting me.

26:16.094 --> 26:17.762
Is that mud?

26:18.722 --> 26:20.889
Well, nice job, Dr. Randy.

26:20.890 --> 26:23.308
Just track all the mud
and bacteria you want

26:23.309 --> 26:24.476
into my ER.

26:24.477 --> 26:27.397
[machines beeping]

26:29.232 --> 26:30.734
[Randy, quietly] Seriously?

26:37.699 --> 26:39.868
[indistinct radio chatter]

26:42.537 --> 26:44.247
Hey. What happened?

26:44.831 --> 26:47.250
The doctor just called it?
That's it?

26:47.834 --> 26:49.168
Yes, that's it.

26:49.169 --> 26:51.170
Dude was dead when we got there.

26:51.171 --> 26:52.921
Okay, well, if you thought
he was dead,

26:52.922 --> 26:54.882
then why did you make me do CPR?

26:54.883 --> 26:57.968
Because nobody dies
in an ambulance.

26:57.969 --> 26:59.344
What do you mean?
It's an ambulance.

26:59.345 --> 27:02.890
- People die all the time.
- Nobody dies in the ambulance.

27:02.891 --> 27:05.434
It's a legal nightmare.
Once we start working on you,

27:05.435 --> 27:07.102
we're not allowed
to declare you dead.

27:07.103 --> 27:09.021
Only a doctor or coroner
can do that.

27:09.022 --> 27:11.231
So even if he has

[Shanice] <i>Randy, you have got
to learn to manage these people</i>

36:37.716 --> 36:39.341
<i>and stop acting like
an asshole to everybody.</i>

36:39.342 --> 36:41.552
Now I gotta deal with this mess.

36:41.553 --> 36:43.262
What do-- It's my last day,
Shanice.

36:43.263 --> 36:45.139
It's not <i>my</i> last day,
and if you finish your shift

36:45.140 --> 36:46.432
we'll see if it's your last.

36:46.433 --> 36:48.642
[scoffs] Really? Oh, no.
This is definitely my--

36:48.643 --> 36:49.728
I said what I said.

36:51.813 --> 36:52.981
Fuck.

36:53.106 --> 36:55.149
So, Carol, if you were
assessing that patient,

36:55.150 --> 36:56.776
would you classify them
as alive?

36:57.902 --> 36:59.737
I see. No, no, no.
No, you're right.

36:59.738 --> 37:01.447
I don't have a nursing degree.

37:01.448 --> 37:02.906
I was trained as a paramedic.

37:02.907 --> 37:05.242
Uh-huh. Well, let me ask you
something, Carol,

37:05.243 --> 37:07.119
since you deal in elder care.

37:07.120 --> 37:09.788
My grandmother died
12 years ago at the age of 99

37:09.789 --> 37:11.665
and we buried her
next to my grandfather

37:11.666 --> 37:13.876
at that cemetery out
by the airport. Know the one?

37:13.877 --> 37:15.711
Uh-huh. Well, let me
ask you this.

37:15.712 --> 37:18.005
If you and I were to
go out there together right now

37:18.006 --> 37:19.381
and dig up
my grandmother's corpse,

37:19.382 --> 37:21.008
do you think
you could revive her?

37:21.009 --> 37:22.593
Because that makes
about as much sense

37:22.594 --> 37:24.470
as what you're saying
to me right now.

37:24.471 --> 37:27.097
Your patient was dead, bitch.

37:27.098 --> 37:29.016
Mm-hmm. And your people
didn't realize it

37:29.017 --> 37:30.642
for five or six <i>hours.</i>

37:30.643 --> 37:32.478
That is called negligence.

37:32.479 --> 37:34.146
But you thought
you'd just call 911

37:34.147 --> 37:35.856
and cover your asses,
is that it?

37:35.857 --> 37:39.193
Ah. Well, how 'bout you and I
call your administrator

37:39.194 --> 37:41.153
and go over this incident
point by point

37:41.154 --> 37:43.405
and see which one of us
still has a goddamn job

37:43.406 --> 37:44.741
by the end of the day?

37:45.909 --> 37:48.660
Oh! You're suddenly okay?

37:48.661 --> 37:50.871
We're clear now, Carol?

37:50.872 --> 37:52.373
Great. Well, if you have
any more problems,

37:52.374 --> 37:54.166
my name is Shanice,
you call me immediately.

37:54.167 --> 37:55.793
You got that?

37:55.794 --> 37:57.086
Damn right.

37:57.087 --> 37:59.255
[airplane engine roaring]

38:02.842 --> 38:04.968
Oh my God, I am so hungry.

38:04.969 --> 38:06.720
Mike, find a taco truck
or something.

38:06.721 --> 38:09.014
My stomach is eating itself.

38:09.015 --> 38:10.474
I got you.
That's all you have to say.

38:10.475 --> 38:12.102
You didn't really quit, did you?

38:13.019 --> 38:14.270
Yeah. I did.

38:15.105 --> 38:16.480
- No, you didn't.
- Yeah, I did.

38:16.481 --> 38:17.773
[scoffs] No, you did not.

38:17.774 --> 38:19.483
Yes, I did.

38:19.484 --> 38:21.652
Look, look.
Let me say this, okay?

38:21.653 --> 38:24.113
Randy has been in this
way too long, okay?

38:24.114 --> 38:26.782
EMS is not supposed to be
working this long.

38:26.783 --> 38:29.451
He don't know what he's gonna do
out in the real world.

38:29.452 --> 38:30.661
This motherfucker can't do shit.

38:30.662 --> 38:32.413
What are you talking about?

38:32.414 --> 38:33.997
I wouldn't know how
to function out there?

38:33.998 --> 38:35.791
Oh, but you know
how to function out there.

38:35.792 --> 38:37.209
- You damn right I do.
- Yeah.

38:37.210 --> 38:38.794
I function well out there too.

38:38.795 --> 38:40.504
'Cause I'm a normal
fuckin' person.

38:40.505 --> 38:42.589
I go home, I take a shit,

38:42.590 --> 38:44.633
then I take a shower
and I put on my clothes

38:44.634 --> 38:46.343
and I pick up my lady,
we go to dinner,

38:46.344 --> 38:48.011
then we come back home
and we fuck.

38:48.012 --> 38:51.306
Okay? That is called
being a part of society.

38:51.307 --> 38:52.725
You, on the other hand,

38:52.726 --> 38:54.935
would not survive one day
in the real world.

38:54.936 --> 38:57.271
'Cause he ain't did shit.
Don't do nothin' besides this.

38:57.272 --> 38:58.940
When the last time
you been on a date?

38:59.357 --> 39:02.985
Hmm? When was the last time
you washed your fuckin' sheets?

39:02.986 --> 39:04.821
- [laughs]
- Oh...

39:07.449 --> 39:09.825
Well, where are you gonna work?

39:09.826 --> 39:11.869
I'm working
in an insurance company.

39:11.870 --> 39:13.871
- [Mike] What?! [laughs]
- What?

39:13.872 --> 39:15.372
- Are you...
- What?

39:15.373 --> 39:17.291
You gon' work in insurance.
Please.

39:17.292 --> 39:19.084
Man, you can't even work
at fuckin' Subway.

39:19.085 --> 39:21.670
I could w-- I could too
work at Subway.

39:21.671 --> 39:23.714
You gotta deal with customers
to work at Subway.

39:23.715 --> 39:25.257
Yeah. I could deal
with customers.

39:25.258 --> 39:27.051
You could?
Let's pretend I'm a customer.

39:27.052 --> 39:28.469
- Okay.
- Okay. You ready?

39:28.470 --> 39:29.928
- Yeah.
- I walk in. Ding!

39:29.929 --> 39:31.513
The little bell go off.
I'm in there.

39:31.514 --> 39:33.474
Oh, hello, sir.
Are you having a nice day?

39:33.475 --> 39:34.641
I'm having a great day.

39:34.642 --> 39:35.934
I would like a sandwich
for lunch.

39:35.935 --> 39:37.394
- Okay.
- You really supposed to--

39:37.395 --> 39:39.063
Would you like a six-inch
or a footlong?

39:39.064 --> 39:41.857
Okay. I want a six-inch
vegetarian sub, okay?

39:41.858 --> 39:43.985
- On wheat with chicken.
- Mm-hmm.

39:45.320 --> 39:47.571
- [Jessica] Hmm.
- Okay.

39:47.572 --> 39:50.282
Uh... that-that doesn't make it

39:50.283 --> 39:51.950
a vegetarian sub
if you add chicken.

39:51.951 --> 39:54.495
No. I would like, like I said,

39:54.496 --> 39:57.831
a six-inch vegetarian sub
on wheat with chicken.

39:57.832 --> 39:59.625
I'm sorry, sir, we can't do that

39:59.626 --> 40:01.043
'cause that's not
a vegetarian sub.

40:01.044 --> 40:02.711
Motherfucker, it is.

40:02.712 --> 40:04.922
- I'm the customer.
- If you have chicken on it...

40:04.923 --> 40:06.757
See? That's exactly why
you couldn't work there.

40:06.758 --> 40:08.717
- But it's not vegetarian!
- It is vegetarian!

40:08.718 --> 40:11.720
There are rules here, sir.
There are rules.

40:11.721 --> 40:13.973
I can order whatever
the fuck I want. Alright?

40:14.391 --> 40:16.141
I want a orange Fanta

40:16.142 --> 40:17.476
with grape juice in it.

40:17.477 --> 40:19.144
You can serve
your own drink, sir.

40:19.145 --> 40:21.146
Here's your cup.
Go to the drink station.

40:21.147 --> 40:22.773
What type of racist shit
is that?!

40:22.774 --> 40:23.941
[laughs]

40:23.942 --> 40:25.359
Fuck that.
I'm calling corporate.

40:25.360 --> 40:27.277
Beep-beep-boop-beep-beep.
Corporate.

40:27.278 --> 40:30.781
Hey! This dude named Randy
that work at the Subway

40:30.782 --> 40:32.491
is a asshole, okay?

40:32.492 --> 40:35.453
He tried to make me
make my own fuckin' drink!

40:36.663 --> 40:37.996
Also this is
a Black man calling,

40:37.997 --> 40:39.248
so you know what that's about!

40:39.249 --> 40:40.709
Bye! Fired!

40:41.543 --> 40:43.293
- Shit.
- Alright. Alright.

40:43.294 --> 40:45.587
Well, you know what?
I'm not working at Subway,

40:45.588 --> 40:47.131
so... win-win.

40:47.132 --> 40:48.466
[dispatch] <i>Medic 42.</i>

40:49.175 --> 40:51.051
No. Come on!

40:51.052 --> 40:53.303
Not now. Don't take it.
No. No. No, Mike. Please.

40:53.304 --> 40:55.139
Come on, man. It's our job.

40:55.140 --> 40:56.640

Oh man, I hope this patient

41:04.107 --> 41:06.233
[groans] ...a taco.

41:09.571 --> 41:12.282
[timer clicking]

41:20.331 --> 41:21.875
[Mike] Oh, this is gonna be
fucked up.

41:22.834 --> 41:24.169
[Taggert laughs]

41:26.963 --> 41:28.630
[Mike] Hey. Hey. Sir?

41:28.631 --> 41:31.341
S-Sir, excuse me. We just--
We just wanna take a look at--

41:31.342 --> 41:32.719

- [Randy] Hey, sir, uh...

41:36.639 --> 41:39.475
Why don't you get on the ground
so we can help you out, okay?

41:39.476 --> 41:41.518
- Here, come here.
- Should I take my helmet off?

41:41.519 --> 41:42.895
[all, emphatically] No!

41:42.896 --> 41:43.937
- No.

- [Jessica] Oh.

41:50.528 --> 41:52.863
You've had a little too much
to drink this afternoon?

41:52.864 --> 41:54.698
- Just a little.
- [Mike] Be right back.

41:54.699 --> 41:55.950
I'ma get the rest
of the equipment.

41:56.743 --> 41:58.577
Hold C-spine, please, madame.

41:58.578 --> 42:00.454
- Yep.
- Thank you.

42:00.455 --> 42:01.955
Hello there. My name's Randy.

42:01.956 --> 42:03.957
We're gonna be taking you
to the hospital today.

42:03.958 --> 42:06.919
- What's your name?
- Uh, my name's Matt.

42:06.920 --> 42:08.253
Or Matthew.

42:08.254 --> 42:09.381
Okay, Matthew.

42:10.090 --> 42:11.924
I'm, uh...
just wondering if you--

42:11.925 --> 42:14.009
Know what?
Maybe call me Matt, actually.

42:14.010 --> 42:16.220
- That feels more like...
- Okay, Matt.

42:16.221 --> 42:18.972
Matt it is.
Any other pain anywhere? Hmm?

42:18.973 --> 42:21.183
[Matt] Eh, just like...
a little headache,

42:21.184 --> 42:22.894
but I don't think
it's a big deal, doc.

42:23.603 --> 42:25.646
Uh, not a doc. Paramedic.

42:25.647 --> 42:27.439
Can you tell us a bit
about what happened?

42:27.440 --> 42:28.524
[tires skidding]

42:28.525 --> 42:29.817
[Matt] Uh, yeah.

42:29.818 --> 42:31.151
- [car door opens]
- I crashed my bike--

42:31.152 --> 42:32.486
- Oh, hey!
- Okay!

42:32.487 --> 42:34.697
- We wanna hold you real still.
- [Matt] Sorry.

42:34.698 --> 42:35.949
[Randy] Real still.

42:37.909 --> 42:40.869
I don't have to go to the haps--
hospital, do I?

42:40.870 --> 42:42.079
'Cause I don't have insurance.

42:42.080 --> 42:43.789
Matt, don't worry about that.

42:43.790 --> 42:46.625
They're just gonna send you
a soul-crushing bill later on.

42:46.626 --> 42:49.002
Excuse me. Excuse me.
I'm a nurse!

42:49.003 --> 42:50.922
Excuse me. I'm a nurse.

42:51.923 --> 42:54.049
I saw the ambulance
and figured you'd need help.

42:54.050 --> 42:55.426
Let's get this helmet off.

42:55.427 --> 42:56.593
You don't have to do that.

42:56.594 --> 42:58.887
Lady, I don't wanna be
mean to you

42:58.888 --> 43:00.806
'cause you remind me
of my auntie,

43:00.807 --> 43:02.057
but leave us the fuck alone.

43:02.058 --> 43:04.059
Is this like a turf war over me?

43:04.060 --> 43:05.687
Right. I need you
to bandage his eyes.

43:06.229 --> 43:07.605
[Matt] What's wrong
with my eyes?

43:12.027 --> 43:14.028
Eyes. Both. Both eyes.

43:14.029 --> 43:15.946
Why? The other eye's fine.

43:15.947 --> 43:18.073
Not a democracy.

43:18.074 --> 43:20.242
- Both eyes.
- That doesn't make any sense.

43:20.243 --> 43:23.329
- Why would I do that?
- [forcefully] Both eyes.

43:26.666 --> 43:27.917
[bandage rips]

43:28.418 --> 43:30.753
Hey, do you guys know
what you're doing?

43:30.754 --> 43:33.088
Because, like, it sounds like
you don't agree.

43:33.089 --> 43:35.299
Oh, we know exactly
what we're doing.

43:35.300 --> 43:36.967
Let him see out of his good eye.

43:36.968 --> 43:40.637
Taggert! Escort this lady
out of my presence immediately.

43:40.638 --> 43:41.723
What?

43:42.307 --> 43:44.099
- Come with me, ma'am. Let's go.
- Out.

43:44.100 --> 43:45.559
I'm not leaving my patient.

43:45.560 --> 43:47.519
- Mm-hmm.
- No. This is <i>my</i> patient!

43:47.520 --> 43:48.520
Mine!

43:48.521 --> 43:50.690
[dramatic music playing]

43:52.525 --> 43:53.942
[Jessica] Sorry.
I'm trying to understand.

43:53.943 --> 43:55.235
Did you have me wrap both eyes

43:55.236 --> 43:56.820
because you didn't want him
to panic?

43:56.821 --> 43:58.697
What did I say?
Not in front of the patient.

43:58.698 --> 44:00.699
- I-I don't understand.
- Not in front of the patient!

44:00.700 --> 44:03.035
- I'm trying to understand.
- Dictator, remember? Dictator!

44:03.036 --> 44:04.536
Yeah, dic-something.

44:04.537 --> 44:06.373
[Matt] I can hear you guys.

44:06.790 --> 44:09.792
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Matt, or Matty.

44:09.793 --> 44:11.752
- 42-year-old male.
- [Matt] Matthew.

44:11.753 --> 44:13.796
Conscious but not alert.
ETOH on board.

44:13.797 --> 44:15.381
Penetrating injury
to his right eye.

44:15.382 --> 44:18.175
As far as we can tell,
no neuro involvement.

44:18.176 --> 44:21.595
Vitals are stable. No SOB
or other injuries detected.

44:21.596 --> 44:23.390
Wow. That wasn't
interesting at all.

44:23.807 --> 44:25.724
'Cause to me,
what I'm seeing here

44:25.725 --> 44:27.602
is a stick in the eye!

44:29.479 --> 44:30.397
What?

44:30.980 --> 44:32.982
I'm sorry, sir.
Your eye, it's, um...

44:33.983 --> 44:34.901
jelly.

44:35.485 --> 44:36.777
Aw, man!

44:36.778 --> 44:38.904
I can sew it up
and give you an eye patch.

44:38.905 --> 44:41.031
That's the best I can do
for you, though.

44:41.032 --> 44:43.284
You can thank your friends
in EMS.

44:44.160 --> 44:46.371
I did everything right.

44:46.955 --> 44:48.498
Get out of my ER.

44:53.128 --> 44:54.295
[Randy sighs]

44:56.506 --> 44:58.007
That guy's a dick.

44:58.758 --> 45:00.592
- [sneezes loudly]
- [Jessica] No, no, no.

45:00.593 --> 45:01.969
No, no. Why both eyes?

45:01.970 --> 45:03.595
- It is a reasonable question.
- Listen.

45:03.596 --> 45:04.972
Our patient is scared
and confused

45:04.973 --> 45:06.974
and he needs to know we know
what the fuck we're doing.

45:06.975 --> 45:08.475
So stop asking questions
in front of him

45:08.476 --> 45:09.685
like a fucking five-year-old.

45:09.686 --> 45:11.311
Know what? I came here
to learn from you

45:11.312 --> 45:13.147
because I thought you had
something to teach me.

45:13.148 --> 45:14.398
Instead, you give me bullshit

45:14.399 --> 45:15.649
about how saving lives
doesn't matter

45:15.650 --> 45:16.859
because you're dead inside.

45:16.860 --> 45:18.736
You're everything
I don't want to be. Everything.

45:18.737 --> 45:20.946
- Shh! Shh!
- Top to bottom. What kind of--

45:20.947 --> 45:23.073
Boo-hoo. Are you jaded?
Are you Mr. Tough Guy?

45:23.074 --> 45:24.867
- What's behind the eyes?
- The brain.

45:24.868 --> 45:27.369
Right. And do we want that stick
moving, carving up the brain?

45:27.370 --> 45:29.121
- No, we don't.
- No. We do not. Right?

45:29.122 --> 45:30.831
- How many eyes do we have?
- Oh, come on.

45:30.832 --> 45:33.375
- How many eyes do we have?!
- Two! We have two.

45:33.376 --> 45:34.753
Do they work independently?

45:36.629 --> 45:38.088
[sighs] Oh, shit.

45:38.089 --> 45:39.340
Yeah.

45:40.008 --> 45:41.342
Where one eye moves...

45:42.802 --> 45:43.803
the other one follows.

45:44.679 --> 45:46.055
They move in tandem.

45:46.056 --> 45:47.514
How far is that stick
back there?

45:47.515 --> 45:49.183
We don't know.
Is it digging up the brain?

45:49.184 --> 45:50.601
We don't know.

45:50.602 --> 45:53.479
Our job is to stop the trauma

45:53.480 --> 45:56.066
and get him into the ER
as soon as possible.

45:57.442 --> 45:58.943
[Randy sighs]

46:01.738 --> 46:02.822
Listen.

46:04.032 --> 46:05.574
The problem at an accident scene

46:05.575 --> 46:07.743
is everyone is so amped up
and full of adrenaline

46:07.744 --> 46:09.078
they get tunnel vision.

46:09.079 --> 46:11.455
They're just looking
at the one problem.

46:11.456 --> 46:13.416
They're not seeing
the big picture.

46:14.542 --> 46:17.378
Our job, while everyone else
is freaking out,

46:17.379 --> 46:20.297
is to take a deep breath,
step back,

46:20.298 --> 46:22.050
and see the whole thing.

46:26.554 --> 46:27.597
You're right.

46:28.306 --> 46:30.266
- Sorry?
- You're right.

46:32.435 --> 46:34.186
I didn't think about that.
Thank you.

46:34.187 --> 46:35.230
Uh...

46:36.314 --> 46:37.856
Okay. Uh...

46:37.857 --> 46:40.150
and I shouldn't have questioned
you in front of a patient.

46:40.151 --> 46:41.735
I'm sorry.

46:41.736 --> 46:43.029
It won't happen again.

46:48.410 --> 46:49.536
Are we good?

46:55.166 --> 46:56.668
Yeah. Yeah, we're good.

46:59.045 --> 47:00.088
[quietly] Well...

47:01.047 --> 47:03.633
[chatter in ER]

47:07.262 --> 47:09.304
- [Randy pants]
- [Jessica sighs]

47:09.305 --> 47:11.223
[Randy] Let's get a burger
before I drop dead.

47:11.224 --> 47:13.100
Did you put that dipshit
in his place?

47:13.101 --> 47:14.185
No.

47:15.353 --> 47:17.187
Because he was right
and I was wrong.

47:17.188 --> 47:20.859
Okay, look. Randy can be
an asshole sometimes, you know?

47:22.318 --> 47:24.862
Okay, yes, he's a asshole
all the damn time.

47:24.863 --> 47:27.823
But there's nobody else I would
ride with other than him.

47:27.824 --> 47:29.241
- [engine revving]
- Jesus!

47:29.242 --> 47:30.994
What the hell, man?!

47:31.494 --> 47:32.828
- What are you--
- He's falling apart.

47:32.829 --> 47:34.204
Pedestrians have
the right of way!

47:34.205 --> 47:35.581
You almost killed me, dude!

47:35.582 --> 47:36.999
We all end up like that?

47:37.000 --> 47:38.959
- Calling yourself a paramedic!
- A broken mess?

47:38.960 --> 47:40.295
Get out!

47:41.504 --> 47:42.756
Hey. Hey. Hey.

47:43.840 --> 47:45.759
Can we go? Please? I'm hungry.

47:46.509 --> 47:47.468
- Okay.
- Alright.

47:47.469 --> 47:49.303
Let's go feed this motherfucker.

47:49.304 --> 47:52.015
["Hell's Henchman"
by Jedi Mind Tricks playing]

48:03.276 --> 48:06.071
- [song continues in restaurant]
- [chatter]

48:09.074 --> 48:11.743
[loud, audible munching]

48:14.204 --> 48:15.205
Stop!

48:15.872 --> 48:17.122
- Okay?
- What?

48:17.123 --> 48:18.457
What you're doing
is fuckin' disgusting.

48:18.458 --> 48:20.125
- I'm hungry.
- What you mean, you hungry?

48:20.126 --> 48:21.377
Just puttin' shit in your mouth.

48:21.378 --> 48:23.253
You're eatin' like
a fuckin' Pac-Man.

48:23.254 --> 48:25.672
You know something?
I don't even wanna eat no more.

48:25.673 --> 48:28.675
You just-- I done lost
my appetite watchin' you eat.

48:28.676 --> 48:30.344
Pretty soon,
I'm starting this job,

48:30.345 --> 48:32.096
I'm gonna have
a real lunch hour.

48:32.097 --> 48:35.349
One hour every single day.

48:35.350 --> 48:36.767
I'm gonna work nine to five.

48:36.768 --> 48:38.560
I'm gonna go home,
I'm gonna sleep.

48:38.561 --> 48:40.270
Hey.

48:40.271 --> 48:42.857
Excuse me.
Um, are you an ambulance driver?

48:43.900 --> 48:45.567
- Paramedic.
- Okay. Wait.

48:45.568 --> 48:47.528
Can I just ask you one question?

48:47.529 --> 48:49.780
Okay. Can I just have
like ten more minutes

48:49.781 --> 48:51.490
and then I'll answer
whatever question you have.

48:51.491 --> 48:52.908
Wait, just one thing.
Super quick.

48:52.909 --> 48:55.537
What's the worst thing
that you've ever seen?

48:56.287 --> 48:58.163
[ominous music playing]

48:58.164 --> 49:00.332
Why do people
always ask me that?

49:00.333 --> 49:03.293
I mean, I get that
there's a morbid fascination,

49:03.294 --> 49:06.339
but I mean,
why do they ask me that?

49:07.132 --> 49:09.633
What's the worst thing
that's ever happened to <i>you?</i>

49:09.634 --> 49:11.176
You want to think about
that right now?

49:11.177 --> 49:12.261
I sure don't.

49:12.262 --> 49:15.139
I have seen
some terrible things.

49:15.140 --> 49:18.226
I know things that
you do not want to know.

49:21.062 --> 49:23.940
I know what brains smell like.

49:24.649 --> 49:27.276
Brains have a distinct smell.
Did you know that?

49:27.277 --> 49:29.486
Sometimes I smell it
when I come out of the ambulance

49:29.487 --> 49:32.781
and I know right then and there,
better watch my step

49:32.782 --> 49:36.953
or else I'll slip and fall in
some poor dead soul's memories.

49:41.750 --> 49:42.959
You know what's in there?

49:43.960 --> 49:45.586
Dead two-year-old.

49:45.587 --> 49:49.424
She got decapitated
by the seat belt upon impact.

49:49.549 --> 49:51.216
Wanna look in there?

49:51.217 --> 49:53.385
You want that image seared
into your brain

49:53.386 --> 49:54.762
forever and ever?

49:54.763 --> 49:56.890
Well, someone's gotta
look inside.

49:57.974 --> 50:00.559
Someone's gotta have that image

50:00.560 --> 50:02.854
in their brain
for the rest of their lives.

50:03.938 --> 50:05.231
I'm that somebody.

50:06.107 --> 50:08.317
That's not even the worst thing
I've seen.

50:08.318 --> 50:11.529
So we get a call,
unknown medical,

50:12.280 --> 50:14.032
neighbor's complaining
about smells.

50:14.949 --> 50:16.450
Go into the apartment,
meet the woman,

50:16.451 --> 50:18.160
she seems totally normal,

50:18.161 --> 50:21.538
but apparently she's suffering
from postpartum depression.

50:21.539 --> 50:23.375
So I ask her,
"Where's the baby?"

50:24.250 --> 50:25.418
"Where is the baby?"

50:25.960 --> 50:29.004
Sure enough, there it is,
in the microwave.

50:29.005 --> 50:31.673
- Stop.
- And its face...

50:31.674 --> 50:33.634
was like melted cheese.

50:33.635 --> 50:35.886
Oh my God.

50:35.887 --> 50:38.430
That is the worst thing
I've ever heard in my life.

50:38.431 --> 50:41.934
I know!
I ordered it medium rare!

50:41.935 --> 50:44.228
[both laugh hysterically]

50:44.229 --> 50:45.229
Ah, come on!

50:45.230 --> 50:46.731
- What the fuck?
- Come on!

50:48.983 --> 50:50.567
Hey, come on.
Don't be like that.

50:50.568 --> 50:51.985
You wanted to know.

50:51.986 --> 50:53.988
You don't want
your chicken sandwich?

50:54.948 --> 50:57.908
You gonna finish that?
[laughing]

50:57.909 --> 51:00.745
Okay, so, there wasn't actually
a baby in the microwave.

51:04.833 --> 51:06.583
[slurps, swallows]

51:06.584 --> 51:10.045
[laughs] See, that's what it is.
You still new to all this.

51:10.046 --> 51:11.964
And you ain't seen shit yet.

51:11.965 --> 51:14.049
Like, nothing. Not at all.

51:14.050 --> 51:15.801
You still got
all that resilience in you.

51:15.802 --> 51:18.721
You got the emotional reserves
in the bank.

51:18.722 --> 51:20.222
You got all that in there.

51:20.223 --> 51:21.306
And when bad shit happen,

51:21.307 --> 51:23.268
you still got that cushion
inside.

51:24.269 --> 51:26.395
Yeah, but when you been
doin' this long enough...

51:26.396 --> 51:28.522
[indistinct radio chatter]

51:28.523 --> 51:30.275
...you run out
of those reserves.

51:31.276 --> 51:33.235
Yeah, but you keep doing it.

51:33.236 --> 51:35.195
Aw, hell no.

51:35.196 --> 51:37.198
Shit, I'm goin' to law school
in six months.

51:38.324 --> 51:39.701
- What?
- Yeah.

51:40.744 --> 51:41.911
Why law school?

51:43.079 --> 51:44.913
You know who gets
fucked over more

51:44.914 --> 51:46.958
than anybody in this country?

51:48.126 --> 51:49.627
Hardworking people.

51:51.212 --> 51:53.006
Hardworking people.

51:53.923 --> 51:55.383
Perfect example: My mom.

51:57.552 --> 52:00.597
She, uh, passed two years ago
of-of cancer.

52:03.183 --> 52:05.518
And two years before that,
she went to the hospital

52:05.977 --> 52:08.020
'cause she knew something
was wrong.

52:08.021 --> 52:09.981
You know,
and they checked her out.

52:10.857 --> 52:12.359
Her insurance covered that.

52:13.693 --> 52:16.112
They diagnosed her,
and her insurance covered that.

52:18.281 --> 52:22.202
But when it came
to actually helping her...

52:23.661 --> 52:26.163
they told her she didn't have
the right policy.

52:26.164 --> 52:28.665
She did her best. She was
calling the insurance company

52:28.666 --> 52:31.544
and... arguing
and fighting and...

52:33.505 --> 52:35.757
But as she was doing that,
the cancer spread.

52:40.053 --> 52:41.221
And she died.

52:43.765 --> 52:45.349
Wasn't even about the doctors
at that point.

52:45.350 --> 52:46.851
She needed a lawyer.

52:48.478 --> 52:51.064
Look, I wanna help people.
That's why I became EMS.

52:52.649 --> 52:54.693
You know?
I want to make a difference.

52:57.362 --> 52:59.406
And I don't feel like
that's what we doin', man.

53:03.660 --> 53:04.828
Also, I...

53:05.870 --> 53:08.080
would love to not make
minimum wage anymore.

53:08.081 --> 53:10.290
- [laughs]
- I'm broke as fuck.

53:10.291 --> 53:12.585
I'm taking all this shit home
and warm it up later.

53:13.336 --> 53:14.629
I don't have a goddamn thing.

53:15.296 --> 53:17.131
[engine starts, revs]

53:17.132 --> 53:19.843

53:35.316 --> 53:37.151
[Mike] Well, you know,
it's nighttime now,

53:37.152 --> 53:40.071
so it's 'bout to get
<i>really</i> weird.

53:40.739 --> 53:43.198
- Weird.
- Weird how?

53:43.199 --> 53:45.868
[dispatch] <i>Medic 42,
respond to A143 Orange Avenue</i>

53:45.869 --> 53:47.077
<i>for a psychiatric patient.</i>

53:47.078 --> 53:48.997
Shit, man. It's the president.

53:50.665 --> 53:53.376
[siren wailing]

53:54.461 --> 53:57.463
[roars] I'm the president

53:57.464 --> 53:59.465
Ah! Shit! He hit me in my nuts!

53:59.466 --> 54:01.550
Mike! Help! Mike!

54:01.551 --> 54:03.677
Get your hands off my friend,
motherfucker!

54:03.678 --> 54:05.304
- [Randy] Mike!
- [all shouting]

54:05.305 --> 54:06.890
- [grunting]
- [Mike] Ah!

54:07.390 --> 54:08.808
Hit him with something!

54:10.310 --> 54:13.145
Not fruit!
Don't hit him with fruit!

54:13.146 --> 54:14.772
Call another ambulance!

54:14.773 --> 54:16.940
[Mike] Charlie, we're trying
to fucking help you!

54:16.941 --> 54:18.943
- Stop it!
- [Charlie] I'm the president!

54:19.694 --> 54:22.030
I'm the president
of the United States!

54:22.781 --> 54:24.823
This is what happened last time.
[screams]

54:24.824 --> 54:28.202
So that is why we gotta get him
in the ambulance peacefully

54:28.203 --> 54:30.496
or he will kick
the living shit out of us.

54:30.497 --> 54:33.123
He sounds like he needs to be
in a psychiatric facility.

54:33.124 --> 54:35.876
No, no, no, no, no.
Look, he's a sweetheart, man.

54:35.877 --> 54:37.754
He don't mean any harm,
you know?

54:39.047 --> 54:40.631
That's usually
when he's on his meds.

54:40.632 --> 54:43.592
Now, if he's off his meds,
it's a different story.

54:43.593 --> 54:44.802
Plus it's the end of the month.

54:44.803 --> 54:46.638
What happens
at the end of the month?

54:47.389 --> 54:50.057
Look, the system give him
20 pills a month, right?

54:50.058 --> 54:51.601
But there's 30 days in a month.

54:52.560 --> 54:54.812
What do you think Charlie do
with those other ten days?

54:54.813 --> 54:56.481
- [sighs]
- Loses his shit.

54:57.232 --> 54:59.191
Sometimes he makes it

54:59.192 --> 55:00.484
sometimes he don't.

55:00.485 --> 55:01.778
Right now look like he didn't.

- [indistinct chatter]

55:25.427 --> 55:27.052
Hey, Mike, kill the lights.

55:29.347 --> 55:31.015
[shatters loudly]

55:32.267 --> 55:35.311

We're gonna send
a second chopper.

56:29.532 --> 56:30.491
Mm-hmm.

56:30.492 --> 56:32.034
We're not leaving anyone behind.

56:32.035 --> 56:33.369

They don't give a fuck, man.

58:37.202 --> 58:39.078
But I give a fuck, okay?

58:39.079 --> 58:40.830
Hey, hey, Mr. President.

She's gonna belt you in, okay?

01:00:05.874 --> 01:00:09.002
We can't take off until
we get you belted in, okay?

01:00:35.445 --> 01:00:37.739
[siren wailing]

01:00:43.828 --> 01:00:45.705
I'm the president
of the United States!

01:00:46.956 --> 01:00:48.707
I'm the president
of the United States!

01:00:48.708 --> 01:00:50.667
[heartbeat pounding]

01:00:50.668 --> 01:00:53.004

01:01:09.062 --> 01:01:11.939
Randy, can you do me a favor
and maybe, um...

01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:14.358
maybe keep the president calm
for a little bit?

01:01:14.359 --> 01:01:16.778
Yeah, I'm on it. [clears throat]

01:01:17.737 --> 01:01:20.698
County ER, it's, uh, Medic 42.

01:01:20.699 --> 01:01:22.325
Can I get a physician on?

01:01:23.159 --> 01:01:24.952
[dispatch] <i>Copy. Standby.</i>

01:01:24.953 --> 01:01:27.204

[doctor]
<i>This is Dr. Serano. What?</i>

01:01:28.665 --> 01:01:31.792
Uh, yeah, Dr. Serano,

Patient was uncontrollable

01:01:41.261 --> 01:01:43.220
Uh, blood pressure 172 over 100.

01:01:43.221 --> 01:01:46.306
Seeking two milligrams
of atropine for sedation.

01:01:46.307 --> 01:01:48.225
- Wait.

01:01:48.226 --> 01:01:49.852
Yeah, for sedation. Yes.

01:01:49.853 --> 01:01:51.478
[Dr. Serano] <i>Atropine?</i>

01:01:51.479 --> 01:01:53.731
<i>Do you mean Ativan?</i>

01:01:53.732 --> 01:01:56.484
<i>Are you trying to kill
your patient, Paramedic Randy?</i>

01:01:57.068 --> 01:01:58.403
Fuck!

Ativan. Yes, Ativan.

01:02:00.405 --> 01:02:02.406

01:02:08.705 --> 01:02:10.039
Fuck.

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:12.374
It had to be Serano. Fuck!

01:02:12.375 --> 01:02:14.502
[music intensifies]

01:02:22.343 --> 01:02:24.303
[music fades]

01:02:24.304 --> 01:02:25.722
[can clatters]

01:02:26.931 --> 01:02:28.098
[clears throat]

01:02:28.099 --> 01:02:29.683
Shit! You scared me.

01:02:29.684 --> 01:02:31.393
[sighs] Oh, please.

01:02:31.394 --> 01:02:32.937
Give me a fuckin' break.

01:02:33.688 --> 01:02:36.899
Hey. You know, there are three
other hospitals in this area.

01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:38.776
Why don't you drop your patients
in one of them, huh?

01:02:38.777 --> 01:02:40.903
It's a busy night.
It's not up to me.

01:02:40.904 --> 01:02:42.113
[chuckles sardonically]

01:02:43.031 --> 01:02:46.325
You take care of what,
one patient at a time?

01:02:46.326 --> 01:02:49.704
I got 25 full beds in there, man.

01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:52.832
I got a waiting room
with an eight-hour wait.

01:02:54.084 --> 01:02:57.962
I got emergency codes going off
upstairs constantly.

01:02:59.255 --> 01:03:02.549
I got an administration
that won't hire enough staff,

01:03:02.550 --> 01:03:05.969
and simultaneously tell me
that I gotta be fuckin' nicer?

01:03:05.970 --> 01:03:09.808
[chuckles] I gotta be nicer
and I gotta be faster.

01:03:10.266 --> 01:03:13.143
This whole building
is on <i>my</i> shoulders, man.

01:03:13.144 --> 01:03:16.981
And now, now I gotta take time
to fix <i>your</i> mistakes.

01:03:18.066 --> 01:03:19.483
Well, I got a better idea.

01:03:19.484 --> 01:03:21.443
Maybe you take
your bullshit patients

01:03:21.444 --> 01:03:22.987
somewhere the fuck else.

01:03:24.572 --> 01:03:27.825
[PA] <i>Dr. Serano,
come to emergency, please.</i>

01:03:27.826 --> 01:03:29.827
Well, you'll excuse me.

01:03:29.828 --> 01:03:32.163
I gotta go back
to never being done.

01:03:37.544 --> 01:03:38.795
Alright, here we go.

01:03:39.921 --> 01:03:41.213
- Let's go.
- [Randy] Watch this.

01:03:41.214 --> 01:03:43.298
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Can you handle the heat?

01:03:43.299 --> 01:03:45.093
I got it, playboy. Come on, now.

01:03:45.885 --> 01:03:47.553
- [metallic clink]
- Oh!

01:03:47.554 --> 01:03:48.972
[can clattering]

01:03:51.266 --> 01:03:52.975
- Whoo!
- Oh, yeah?

01:03:52.976 --> 01:03:55.352
- That's not a home run.
- That's a home run, man.

01:03:55.353 --> 01:03:57.271
You didn't even make it
to the sidewalk.

01:03:57.272 --> 01:03:58.564
Went right over your head.

01:03:58.565 --> 01:04:01.150
The gutter is the home run line.

01:04:01.151 --> 01:04:03.068
- That's bullshit.
- Oh, shit. That ain't bullshit.

01:04:03.069 --> 01:04:04.319
That's a fuckin' home run.

01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:06.280
- Don't be a hater.
- Go get your ball.

01:04:06.281 --> 01:04:08.282
- I'm up.
- No. No. What...

01:04:08.283 --> 01:04:10.243
Know something?
This is crazy that this is...

01:04:10.869 --> 01:04:13.245
We been doin' this silly shit

01:04:13.246 --> 01:04:14.580
You gon' miss me?

01:04:14.581 --> 01:04:15.749
Oh...

01:04:16.249 --> 01:04:18.043
We're gonna see each other.
We'll hang out.

01:04:18.752 --> 01:04:20.295
What you mean?
We don't hang out.

01:04:20.879 --> 01:04:23.005
Yeah, we do.

- This is...

01:04:28.887 --> 01:04:30.137
This is EMS shit, man.

We don't even talk like that.

01:04:33.058 --> 01:04:34.475
What type of shit
you want me to ask?

01:04:34.476 --> 01:04:36.268
Like, how's your mom doing?
Or...

01:04:36.269 --> 01:04:38.103
if your lawn is being tended to.

01:04:38.104 --> 01:04:40.022
If you have a lawn.
I don't even know...

01:04:40.023 --> 01:04:42.734
My mom is dead
and I don't have a lawn.

01:04:43.234 --> 01:04:45.236
And... I don't know. What else?

01:04:46.154 --> 01:04:49.573
Goddamn, man.
We're just coworkers, man.

01:04:49.574 --> 01:04:51.867

your best friend or something.

Okay, Mike, continue CPR.

01:06:43.563 --> 01:06:45.564
How long was he down
before you started CPR?

01:06:45.565 --> 01:06:47.316
We thought he just had
the wind knocked out of him--

01:06:47.317 --> 01:06:49.401
- Yeah, how long exactly?
- I don't know, maybe a minute.

01:06:49.402 --> 01:06:50.904

We're gonna do everything

01:08:10.358 --> 01:08:11.900
My chest hurts.

01:08:11.901 --> 01:08:14.361
[Randy] There's no easy way
to say this, Vicente.

01:08:14.362 --> 01:08:16.070
Your heart got hit
with a baseball

01:08:16.071 --> 01:08:18.824
and it stopped.
That's why your chest hurts.

01:08:18.825 --> 01:08:22.244
In the exact millisecond,
your heart got hit

01:08:22.245 --> 01:08:23.578
just as it was contracting.

01:08:23.579 --> 01:08:25.998
It's like the ball reached out

01:08:25.999 --> 01:08:28.043
and sucker-punched your heart.

01:08:28.877 --> 01:08:30.502
It's a one-in-a-million chance.

01:08:30.503 --> 01:08:33.797
And as a matter of fact,
after all this,

01:08:33.798 --> 01:08:36.426
I would go buy a lottery ticket
if I were you.

01:08:37.843 --> 01:08:40.136
So... am I gonna die?

01:08:40.137 --> 01:08:43.599
You're with us now, and our job
is to keep you healthy.

01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:47.227
Okay? So just lie there
and relax.

01:08:47.812 --> 01:08:49.064
BP's 90 over 60.

01:08:49.898 --> 01:08:51.648
[Randy] Okay.
That's not a bad start.

01:08:51.649 --> 01:08:52.815
You're gonna feel
a little sting.

01:08:52.816 --> 01:08:54.525
Gonna get an IV started.

01:08:54.526 --> 01:08:56.945

01:08:57.614 --> 01:08:58.530
Okay.

01:08:59.908 --> 01:09:02.577
Now... you having
any trouble breathing?

01:09:03.453 --> 01:09:05.872
[Vicente] A little.
My chest hurts.

01:09:06.956 --> 01:09:08.623
Any pain anywhere else?

01:09:08.624 --> 01:09:10.626
No. Not really.

01:09:10.627 --> 01:09:12.543
You have any medical problems?

01:09:12.544 --> 01:09:14.922
- [Vicente] No.
- On any meds? Any allergies?

01:09:14.923 --> 01:09:16.465
- [Vicente] No.
- No? Okay.

01:09:16.466 --> 01:09:18.551
- How old are you again?
- Eleven.

01:09:19.302 --> 01:09:21.052
- [Randy] Are you married?
- What?

01:09:21.053 --> 01:09:22.846
- No.
- [Randy] I get it.

01:09:22.847 --> 01:09:25.099
You're not ready to settle.
You wanna play the field.

01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:26.684
You wanna keep
your options open.

01:09:26.685 --> 01:09:28.686
That commitment is scary.

01:09:28.687 --> 01:09:30.938
I get it. I'm with you.
Pound it.

01:09:30.939 --> 01:09:32.440
Boom. [chuckles]

01:09:33.024 --> 01:09:36.486
I'm gonna call the hospital.
You just lie there and relax.

01:09:37.236 --> 01:09:39.196
So... am I gonna die?

01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:42.659

01:09:45.704 --> 01:09:47.163

01:23:54.386 --> 01:23:55.594
So get ready for us!

01:23:55.595 --> 01:23:58.515
[dramatic, suspenseful music
playing]

01:24:02.268 --> 01:24:05.021
[ambulance siren wailing,
horn honking]

01:24:06.856 --> 01:24:08.190
- Hey, Astor?
- Yeah?

01:24:08.191 --> 01:24:09.400
- Wanna take that baby?
- Got it.

01:24:09.401 --> 01:24:10.819
Meet us inside?

01:24:11.945 --> 01:24:13.362
Medic 42. What bay?

01:24:13.363 --> 01:24:14.863
Two. But they're not happy.

01:24:14.864 --> 01:24:16.532
Serano's on the warpath.

01:24:16.533 --> 01:24:18.076
[Randy] No one is happy.

01:24:19.536 --> 01:24:21.829
No. No. No.

01:24:21.830 --> 01:24:23.747
- Stop.
- No, no, no. Doctor, listen.

01:24:23.748 --> 01:24:25.416
- This is a 30-something--
- No!

01:24:25.417 --> 01:24:27.084
- A head-on collision.
- No. No. No.

01:24:27.085 --> 01:24:28.544
The four other passengers
are DOA.

01:24:28.545 --> 01:24:30.254
She is not a Level I criteria.

01:24:30.255 --> 01:24:33.757
Do you have any idea how
expensive a Level I criteria is?

01:24:33.758 --> 01:24:35.509
Any idea, you idiot?

01:24:35.510 --> 01:24:37.428
Okay! This patient meets
all Level I criteria.

01:24:37.429 --> 01:24:39.054
She's not even intubated!

01:24:39.055 --> 01:24:41.140
You got her bagged?
What the hell is that?

01:24:41.141 --> 01:24:43.642
This patient is dying, asshole!

01:24:43.643 --> 01:24:45.310
- Now listen to my report!
- Asshole?

01:24:45.311 --> 01:24:46.937
How 'bout fuck you, asshole!

01:24:46.938 --> 01:24:49.148
- Come on! Come on!
- Shit.

01:24:49.149 --> 01:24:52.359
I will be happy to kick your ass
and put you in a bed next to her

01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:53.861
but you need to listen
to my report!

01:24:53.862 --> 01:24:56.530
How 'bout this? Instead
I call your supervisor,

01:24:56.531 --> 01:24:58.366
we settle this right now.

01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:01.369
Who the fuck do you think
you are?

01:25:05.290 --> 01:25:06.166
Excuse me?

01:25:06.833 --> 01:25:08.625
- Who are you?
- This patient just went apneic

01:25:08.626 --> 01:25:11.045
three times with no gag reflex
on the way to the hospital.

01:25:11.046 --> 01:25:12.171
She's got a skull fracture.

01:25:12.172 --> 01:25:13.756
She meets all Level I criteria.

01:25:13.757 --> 01:25:15.299
Because last time I checked,

01:25:15.300 --> 01:25:17.384
when a patient goes apneic
with no gag,

01:25:17.385 --> 01:25:20.262
their GCS goes down to three.
Right?

01:25:20.263 --> 01:25:22.639
And I just watched
this paramedic fight like hell

01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:24.975
to save this woman's life
while caring for her child

01:25:24.976 --> 01:25:27.811
and dodging incoming traffic
at the same fucking time!

01:25:27.812 --> 01:25:30.105
And all I see you doing
is standing there,

01:25:30.106 --> 01:25:32.816
like a fucking asshole,
with your dick in your hand,

01:25:32.817 --> 01:25:34.902
arguing with him
about this patient

01:25:34.903 --> 01:25:35.986
who is dying!

01:25:35.987 --> 01:25:37.781
<i>Your</i> patient!

01:25:39.908 --> 01:25:41.408
And if you refuse to treat her,

01:25:41.409 --> 01:25:43.244
you'll lose
your goddamn license.

01:25:47.290 --> 01:25:48.333
Who are you?

01:25:50.585 --> 01:25:52.796
I'm Dr. Romero.
I'm your new resident.

01:25:55.298 --> 01:25:56.591
Oh, shit.

01:25:58.927 --> 01:26:00.677
[laughs]

01:26:00.678 --> 01:26:04.015
Well, Dr. Romero...

01:26:06.184 --> 01:26:07.811
I look forward
to working with you.

01:26:09.604 --> 01:26:11.189
We're gonna have so much fun.

01:26:12.273 --> 01:26:13.774
Get the patient.

01:26:13.775 --> 01:26:15.193
[sighs]

01:26:19.072 --> 01:26:21.240
O-Okay, look. [laughs]

01:26:21.241 --> 01:26:24.244
You mean to tell me
you're a doctor?

01:26:25.912 --> 01:26:27.997
Resident, but yeah.

01:26:28.581 --> 01:26:30.499
But you told us
you were a paramedic.

01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:32.710
No, I-I didn't. You said that.

01:26:32.711 --> 01:26:34.254
I just didn't correct you.

01:26:34.879 --> 01:26:36.880
Um... I never said that.

01:26:36.881 --> 01:26:39.842
You-- That's what you said
when we first met you.

01:26:39.843 --> 01:26:42.803
No. Why would I?
I'm a doctor, not a paramedic.

01:26:42.804 --> 01:26:45.222
Hey, Dr. What's-your-face.

01:26:45.223 --> 01:26:47.517
Grab a bedpan and come with me.

01:26:49.561 --> 01:26:51.438
We're gonna have <i>so</i> much fun!

01:26:54.566 --> 01:26:57.110
- Hmm.
- Whoa.

01:26:58.486 --> 01:26:59.863
That's, uh...

01:27:01.322 --> 01:27:02.782
Huh.

01:27:09.706 --> 01:27:10.873
Hey.

01:27:10.874 --> 01:27:12.374
Good news:

01:27:12.375 --> 01:27:13.835
Patient's gonna live.

01:27:15.003 --> 01:27:16.920
I mean, usually once
we drop 'em off

01:27:16.921 --> 01:27:19.132
it's not our problem anymore.
But, um...

01:27:20.008 --> 01:27:21.884
But it's good to, um,

01:27:21.885 --> 01:27:24.054
it's good to know
she-she made it, you know?

01:27:24.721 --> 01:27:26.014
Yeah.

01:27:27.432 --> 01:27:29.267
Way to, uh, throw yourself
under the bus...

01:27:30.018 --> 01:27:31.352

01:27:31.353 --> 01:27:33.979
Serano's gonna make your life
a living hell.

01:27:33.980 --> 01:27:35.606
I know.

01:27:35.607 --> 01:27:37.859
I never wanna be
that kind of surgeon.

01:27:40.028 --> 01:27:41.613
Thanks for the coffee, doc.

- [clears throat]

01:27:57.879 --> 01:27:59.172
She should have died.

01:28:00.715 --> 01:28:02.425
She would have died in my care.

01:28:04.803 --> 01:28:07.764
Right now, I'd be telling that
family that their mom is dead.

01:28:12.894 --> 01:28:14.645
You know, I thought
I'd come out here today

01:28:14.646 --> 01:28:16.439
and I'd meet the paramedics
and...

01:28:17.357 --> 01:28:19.859
see what you do, how you work.

01:28:23.405 --> 01:28:25.073
And I know you're sick
of your job.

01:28:25.990 --> 01:28:27.282
I know you're burnt out.

01:28:27.283 --> 01:28:29.369
I know you think
you don't make a difference.

01:28:31.162 --> 01:28:32.789
But you made a difference today.

01:28:33.540 --> 01:28:35.166
- [sighs]
- You did.

01:28:36.626 --> 01:28:38.253
You saved her life.

01:28:40.672 --> 01:28:42.298
And you saved her family.

01:28:47.262 --> 01:28:49.222
You're the kind of doctor
I want to be.

01:28:52.892 --> 01:28:54.310
Not a doctor.

01:28:55.478 --> 01:28:56.563
Well...

01:28:57.856 --> 01:28:59.274
if I ever need saving...

01:29:01.443 --> 01:29:03.486

that shows up.
