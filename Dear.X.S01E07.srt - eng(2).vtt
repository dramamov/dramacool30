ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND EVENTS
IN THIS WORK ARE FICTITIOUS

00:00:55.805 --> 00:00:57.432
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
WITH GUARDIANS PRESENT

00:01:47.398 --> 00:01:48.483
Boss.

00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:52.445
That really hurts.

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:55.073
So that's what love does to people.

00:01:55.698 --> 00:01:59.160
You really got that fired up
over a few insults?

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.206
Just out of curiosity

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.127
did you really think
you could take those guys?

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.672
I just wanted to get my ass kicked.
Hard enough to knock my senses out.

00:02:11.881 --> 00:02:13.591
You're a pervert, aren't you?

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:17.220
You're totally my type.

00:02:35.947 --> 00:02:39.909
NEWSHOUND HEE-KOOK

00:02:41.452 --> 00:02:43.454
What's going on
between Ah-jin and In-gang?

00:02:43.538 --> 00:02:44.539
Did you call for a driver?

00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:49.377
They were making out.
Did he dump you for her?

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:53.173
Lena, are you there?

00:02:53.965 --> 00:02:55.175
Are you in shock?

00:03:31.628 --> 00:03:32.629
Be careful.

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:37.133
Lena's cousin, reporter Lim Hee-kook,
knows about you and In-gang.

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:58.071
EPISODE 7: THE WHEEL OF FATE

00:03:59.447 --> 00:04:02.450
Do you know how damaging
a scandal like this can be for you?

00:04:03.451 --> 00:04:07.830
I'll try to keep the press at bay,
but you need to end things with him.

00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:10.250
It's better to end it now

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:12.669
than let a messy relationship
make things awkward at work.

00:04:13.795 --> 00:04:14.796
Ms. Seo.

00:04:15.964 --> 00:04:18.633
This isn't some casual fling.

00:04:19.217 --> 00:04:21.010
We really like each other.

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:22.095
Are you joking?

00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:25.890
You're a smart girl,
so stop acting like you don't get it.

00:04:26.224 --> 00:04:28.518
This isn't the right time
for you to be dating.

00:04:29.727 --> 00:04:32.647
Did you get this photo
from Lim Hee-kook?

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:33.731
Why do you ask?

00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:35.108
I'll talk to him.

00:04:35.191 --> 00:04:37.068
He doesn't like you. You know that.

00:04:37.151 --> 00:04:39.529
If he reached out to you
before running the story

00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:41.656
he must be after something.

00:04:42.323 --> 00:04:44.867
I'd like to talk to him in person.

00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:46.494
What are you going to do?

00:04:46.577 --> 00:04:47.912
I'll hear him out

00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:50.873
and if the terms are acceptable,
I'll cut a deal.

00:05:02.427 --> 00:05:05.596
I'll see myself out
so the two of you can talk.

00:05:22.947 --> 00:05:24.324
What happened?

00:05:25.783 --> 00:05:29.370
You said yourself
you wanted nothing to do with her.

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:31.956
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

00:05:34.083 --> 00:05:35.543
I didn't expect this to happen.

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:37.378
Forget about her for a second.

00:05:37.462 --> 00:05:40.131
Do you know how bad this scandal
will make you look?

00:05:40.214 --> 00:05:42.508
You just announced
your breakup with Lena.

00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:45.720
People will call it a rebound,
and you'll get slammed for it.

00:05:45.803 --> 00:05:47.847
Things like this
don't sit well with the public.

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.724
How are you going to handle that?

00:05:50.308 --> 00:05:51.309
Mi-ri.

00:05:52.602 --> 00:05:54.145
I'm no longer afraid of that.

00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:57.190
I'm not taking this lightly either.

00:05:58.775 --> 00:06:00.068
I'll take whatever comes.

00:06:00.902 --> 00:06:02.612
- You really--
- I'd really love it

00:06:03.154 --> 00:06:05.281
if you could give us your blessing.

00:06:07.075 --> 00:06:09.077
Give us your support.

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:13.289
You'll do that, right?

00:06:31.015 --> 00:06:33.184
I heard you're good at your job

00:06:33.601 --> 00:06:35.311
so I wanted to treat you to a meal.

00:06:36.854 --> 00:06:40.274
You know how touchy folks are
about scandals these days.

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.903
He started dating you
the moment he broke up with Lena.

00:06:44.278 --> 00:06:48.699
That's the kind of thing
that can ruin a beloved actor.

00:06:50.701 --> 00:06:52.787
You're not very good
at making threats.

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:55.331
Save that speech for In-gang.

00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:58.167
I don't have much to lose
from this relationship.

00:06:58.876 --> 00:07:01.003
If anything,
it might even spark some curiosity.

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:02.130
Fine.

00:07:02.797 --> 00:07:03.881
In that case

00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:07.343
I'll release this article as well.

00:07:11.055 --> 00:07:12.515
BAEK AH-JIN BECOMES
HEO IN-GANG'S GIRL

00:07:12.598 --> 00:07:16.352
Don't you think
that headline is a little tacky?

00:07:16.727 --> 00:07:18.604
- Excuse me?
- Change the headline

00:07:18.688 --> 00:07:21.023
to "Baek Ah-jin, the woman
who captured In-gang's heart."

00:07:24.402 --> 00:07:25.486
Listen, Ms. Baek.

00:07:26.904 --> 00:07:30.199
Mr. Lim, I hear you're Lena's cousin.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.161
Cousins hang out when they're kids.

00:07:33.244 --> 00:07:35.246
And as adults,
exchange occasional texts.

00:07:35.329 --> 00:07:38.958
So why don't you leave it at that
and get friendly with me instead?

00:07:39.542 --> 00:07:40.918
I don't need friends.

00:07:41.836 --> 00:07:44.755
But I'm all ears
if you're offering something else.

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:45.840
Do you mean money?

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:53.890
You're already getting a salary,
so I don't need to pad your pockets.

00:07:54.849 --> 00:07:56.642
You know how it is.

00:07:56.726 --> 00:08:00.271
People are always curious
about celebrity relationships.

00:08:00.688 --> 00:08:03.774
Someone else's love life
is always more entertaining.

00:08:03.858 --> 00:08:07.278
I was hoping you'd be the one
to write those entertaining pieces.

00:08:07.361 --> 00:08:09.489
So? What's the catch?

00:08:09.572 --> 00:08:12.366
If you accept my offer right now

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:17.413
I'll give you the exclusive rights
to our love story.

00:08:17.914 --> 00:08:20.708
Of course, this stays between us.

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:25.421
You can use the photos
in this flash drive.

00:08:28.382 --> 00:08:31.469
Who took these photos?

00:08:31.552 --> 00:08:34.263
I'm giving them to you
so you don't have to tail me.

00:08:34.639 --> 00:08:36.516
And I'll keep them coming.

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:39.143
You won't regret this.

00:08:40.269 --> 00:08:41.771
I guarantee you

00:08:41.854 --> 00:08:45.566
that my love story will be fiery
and impossible to ignore.

00:08:46.442 --> 00:08:50.071
Rising star Baek Ah-jin
and actor Heo In-gang

00:08:50.154 --> 00:08:53.533
were spotted
on a private outing in Gangnam.

00:08:53.616 --> 00:08:57.495
As news of their blossoming romance
sweeps across the country

00:08:57.578 --> 00:08:59.872
fans appear split.

00:08:59.956 --> 00:09:03.751
Some are thrilled,
saying the two look perfect together.

00:09:03.834 --> 00:09:06.087
Others, however,
are criticizing the timing

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:09.340
accusing him of moving on too quickly
after his breakup with Lena.

00:09:09.423 --> 00:09:13.261
Whatever the truth may be,
it's a new beginning for the couple.

00:09:13.344 --> 00:09:17.139
So rather than dragging them down,
we should show them a little support.

00:09:22.687 --> 00:09:23.813
- Hyang-i.
- Yes?

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:26.816
- Are you going on a date today?
- No.

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:30.695
Come on.
It's written all over your face.

00:09:31.612 --> 00:09:32.863
Is it a blind date?

00:09:32.947 --> 00:09:34.407
Something like that.

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:35.741
What time?

00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:36.826
It's at 7 p.m.

00:09:37.451 --> 00:09:38.452
Why do you ask?

00:09:39.036 --> 00:09:40.496
I'll let the salon know.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.748
Get your hair done nicely
and have fun.

00:09:43.541 --> 00:09:45.626
Thank you so much, Ah-jin!

00:09:46.502 --> 00:09:49.005
- And don't drink too much.
- I won't.

00:09:49.088 --> 00:09:51.048
You get way too honest
when you drink.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:52.675
Okay, I promise.

00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:54.594
I'll watch my mouth.

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:58.306
Why are you so handsome?

00:09:59.807 --> 00:10:01.350
You're a manager

00:10:01.434 --> 00:10:04.103
so you must meet
a lot of good-looking celebrities.

00:10:04.186 --> 00:10:07.315
Being a manager
isn't all it's cracked up to be.

00:10:07.398 --> 00:10:10.735
You have no idea
how much dirt we have to deal with.

00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:14.739
Did you take the blame
for someone else's crime?

00:10:15.197 --> 00:10:16.407
How did you know that?

00:10:19.535 --> 00:10:21.912
No. You didn't hear it from me.

00:10:23.331 --> 00:10:24.498
Don't do that to me.

00:10:24.582 --> 00:10:26.334
I'll keep it to myself, so tell me.

00:10:26.417 --> 00:10:27.418
No.

00:10:33.549 --> 00:10:34.592
Hyang-i.

00:10:38.554 --> 00:10:41.223
Talking to someone can help you
get things off your chest.

00:10:42.141 --> 00:10:44.018
I promise I'll keep it a secret.

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:53.110
You can't tell anyone about this.

00:10:56.822 --> 00:10:59.575
A few years back...

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:31.065
- Hyang-i.
- Yes?

00:11:32.191 --> 00:11:33.401
Thanks for telling me.

00:11:34.568 --> 00:11:36.612
Don't tell anyone else.

00:11:40.908 --> 00:11:42.284
I'm supposed to take a break?

00:11:42.368 --> 00:11:44.995
- There must be scripts coming in.
- There are.

00:11:45.079 --> 00:11:49.875
But the other actors turn it down
when they find out you're the lead.

00:11:50.292 --> 00:11:51.335
You have to accept it.

00:11:51.419 --> 00:11:54.088
Who would want to work with
an actress who beat up a junior?

00:11:54.171 --> 00:11:55.339
Seriously.

00:11:55.756 --> 00:11:57.174
I slapped her once.

00:11:58.217 --> 00:11:59.218
Twice, tops.

00:11:59.844 --> 00:12:00.970
And I had my reasons.

00:12:01.303 --> 00:12:03.472
Do you know how she got back at me?

00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:05.349
You know how ruthless she is.

00:12:05.683 --> 00:12:06.892
What am I going to do with you?

00:12:07.601 --> 00:12:08.602
What's with that look?

00:12:08.936 --> 00:12:10.896
You still haven't come
to your senses.

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:13.566
Get out of here.

00:12:33.878 --> 00:12:36.046
When Lena got caught driving drunk

00:12:37.131 --> 00:12:39.842
I covered for her
and said I was the one driving.

00:12:41.093 --> 00:12:42.428
I was even interrogated

00:12:42.511 --> 00:12:45.055
for supposedly
driving under the influence.

00:12:45.473 --> 00:12:46.474
Lena.

00:12:56.525 --> 00:12:57.985
Why do you look so surprised?

00:13:08.746 --> 00:13:10.331
Well, I warned you

00:13:11.665 --> 00:13:12.792
not to mess with me.

00:13:15.252 --> 00:13:16.629
Why won't you ever listen?

00:13:20.007 --> 00:13:22.718
It kind of kills the fun
if you're already making that face.

00:13:22.802 --> 00:13:26.013
Tell me you didn't
release this video yet.

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:29.141
You didn't, right?

00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:30.643
Oh, dear.

00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:34.605
Is that what you want to know?

00:13:34.688 --> 00:13:38.442
Please, Ah-jin.
If this goes public, I'm finished.

00:13:38.526 --> 00:13:40.194
You can take everything from me.

00:13:40.486 --> 00:13:41.612
Just help me.

00:13:43.197 --> 00:13:44.490
Who says you're finished?

00:13:48.577 --> 00:13:50.830
You're not.
This is just the beginning.

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:53.290
Hell doesn't end with a single blow.

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:11.851
See?

00:14:12.351 --> 00:14:13.894
This won't be ending anytime soon.

00:14:19.525 --> 00:14:23.112
That's why you should've
listened to me.

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:28.325
I wouldn't have taken it this far
if you had left me alone.

00:14:31.203 --> 00:14:33.497
Don't ever think about
coming back to this business.

00:14:33.581 --> 00:14:35.082
And spare yourself the fantasy

00:14:35.165 --> 00:14:37.459
that you can disappear
for a few years and sneak back in.

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:39.336
Don't beg me to save you either.

00:14:40.421 --> 00:14:41.714
Because I won't.

00:14:43.007 --> 00:14:44.925
Own it, Lena.

00:14:45.759 --> 00:14:48.012
Or let yourself crumble.

00:14:53.934 --> 00:14:54.935
No.

00:14:57.897 --> 00:14:58.898
What do I do?

00:15:24.381 --> 00:15:25.716
Did you see the video?

00:15:29.136 --> 00:15:31.639
This is all because you couldn't keep
your mouth shut.

00:15:33.682 --> 00:15:35.392
I told you to watch what you say.

00:15:38.103 --> 00:15:40.022
This isn't going to work between us.

00:15:40.773 --> 00:15:44.443
How am I supposed to trust you
after what you spilled?

00:15:45.486 --> 00:15:46.487
Wouldn't you agree?

00:15:49.365 --> 00:15:50.908
Consider today your last day.

00:15:53.661 --> 00:15:54.662
Ah-jin.

00:15:57.623 --> 00:16:00.626
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

00:16:00.709 --> 00:16:03.504
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

00:16:04.588 --> 00:16:05.673
HAPPY BIRTHDAY
HONG KYUNG-SUK

00:16:07.216 --> 00:16:09.885
This is my favorite color.

00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:11.470
I'm glad you like it.

00:16:11.553 --> 00:16:12.805
Thank you, Ah-jin.

00:16:13.472 --> 00:16:16.141
All right. One, two, three.

00:16:16.433 --> 00:16:20.312
This has been such a lovely birthday.

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:32.491
WINTER SLEEP

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:01.937
How was your trip?

00:17:05.941 --> 00:17:08.110
HEO IN-GANG AND BAEK AH-JIN'S OUTFITS
AT THE AIRPORT

00:17:22.082 --> 00:17:25.044
HEO IN-GANG AND BAEK AH-JIN
ON SUMMER VACATION

00:17:50.819 --> 00:17:54.364
I'm deeply in love with her.

00:17:54.823 --> 00:17:56.658
So, I hope you guys understand.

00:17:56.742 --> 00:17:58.744
Show my Ah-jin some love.

00:17:58.827 --> 00:18:00.662
LIVE

00:18:24.353 --> 00:18:26.522
HEO IN-GANG AND BAEK AH-JIN
CAUGHT ON THE CUTEST DATE

00:18:26.605 --> 00:18:28.524
#LOVESTAGRAM #COUPLE
#BAEKGANG #COUPLEVIBES

00:18:38.117 --> 00:18:39.409
Were you writing again?

00:18:39.993 --> 00:18:41.411
I knew it.

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:45.833
You obviously skipped breakfast.
Don't tell me you also skipped lunch.

00:18:46.458 --> 00:18:48.043
I brought you lunch just in case.

00:18:48.127 --> 00:18:50.629
I'm finishing up. You can eat first.

00:18:50.712 --> 00:18:52.506
Why don't you just join me?

00:18:53.257 --> 00:18:54.842
I bought this for you.

00:19:01.473 --> 00:19:02.474
Ta-da.

00:19:03.183 --> 00:19:04.184
Here.

00:19:06.228 --> 00:19:07.479
Are you busy tonight?

00:19:07.896 --> 00:19:08.981
No. Why?

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:12.484
Let's go to the premiere
of the movie Ah-jin is in.

00:19:15.028 --> 00:19:17.823
I just want to see if she's any good.

00:19:17.906 --> 00:19:19.783
I'll laugh at her if she's bad.

00:19:21.368 --> 00:19:22.369
Eat up.

00:19:30.043 --> 00:19:31.670
Hi, I'm Baek Ah-jin.

00:19:31.753 --> 00:19:33.255
VIP SCREENING
THE WOMAN WITH A SUITCASE

00:19:33.338 --> 00:19:36.049
I played Myo-hui.

00:19:36.133 --> 00:19:38.969
We had a lot of fun
filming this movie.

00:19:39.052 --> 00:19:44.099
Watching Myo-hui spiral into madness
should give you chills.

00:19:44.183 --> 00:19:46.435
Thank you for coming.
I hope you enjoy the movie.

00:19:46.518 --> 00:19:47.519
Thank you.

00:19:58.155 --> 00:20:00.824
THE WOMAN WITH A SUITCASE

00:20:14.463 --> 00:20:17.299
Jun-seo, you'll help me, right?

00:20:22.638 --> 00:20:24.139
Don't worry, Jun-seo.

00:20:26.225 --> 00:20:28.018
I'll date him for exactly a year.

00:20:31.939 --> 00:20:33.315
That's all I need.

00:20:43.325 --> 00:20:47.120
Reporters who saw the screening
are already writing their pieces

00:20:47.204 --> 00:20:48.622
and they're pretty favorable.

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:52.668
I'm proud of you, Ah-jin.

00:21:04.096 --> 00:21:05.430
You smell nice.

00:21:06.014 --> 00:21:07.557
What cologne did you use today?

00:21:08.642 --> 00:21:10.978
I forgot to put any on.

00:21:14.481 --> 00:21:15.899
Then keep it that way.

00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:20.487
I like your natural scent
better than any cologne.

00:21:25.367 --> 00:21:26.827
I like you better than anything.

00:21:39.506 --> 00:21:43.176
Out gallivanting
instead of writing until this hour?

00:21:44.011 --> 00:21:47.723
Keep acting like a wife,
and I'll change the door code.

00:21:49.308 --> 00:21:51.935
Honey, what does "co-offender" mean?

00:21:52.019 --> 00:21:53.186
You don't need to know.

00:21:54.688 --> 00:21:55.939
I'll just look it up.

00:21:59.818 --> 00:22:02.904
"A person who, together with others,
directly carries out an act

00:22:02.988 --> 00:22:05.115
that satisfies the elements
of a criminal offense

00:22:05.198 --> 00:22:07.409
of the act itself"?

00:22:10.329 --> 00:22:12.289
Why the sudden interest in my book?

00:22:15.375 --> 00:22:17.544
I'm suddenly interested in you.

00:22:23.759 --> 00:22:26.636
Did Ah-jin call you?

00:22:27.054 --> 00:22:29.097
She doesn't call me nowadays.

00:22:32.517 --> 00:22:33.685
I guess she's happy.

00:22:39.441 --> 00:22:40.442
No.

00:22:40.901 --> 00:22:42.569
When the boss needs me

00:22:42.652 --> 00:22:45.530
it means something bad
has happened to her.

00:22:46.948 --> 00:22:48.325
So no news means good news.

00:22:49.242 --> 00:22:50.410
But...

00:22:58.668 --> 00:23:02.047
If I'm being honest,
I wish she would call me.

00:23:04.383 --> 00:23:05.467
I don't know.

00:23:09.054 --> 00:23:10.097
Want to grab a drink?

00:23:10.931 --> 00:23:11.932
No.

00:23:13.225 --> 00:23:14.393
Go home.

00:23:19.606 --> 00:23:21.817
I don't have a home.

00:23:22.275 --> 00:23:24.277
And if I leave, you'll die.

00:23:26.029 --> 00:23:27.239
Of boredom.

00:23:44.131 --> 00:23:46.049
MOM

00:23:46.925 --> 00:23:49.553
Pick up your phone. It's so loud.

00:23:50.178 --> 00:23:51.930
I'm trying to read here.

00:23:58.728 --> 00:24:00.230
Why won't you pick up?

00:24:03.191 --> 00:24:05.777
MOM

00:24:07.696 --> 00:24:08.697
Dude.

00:24:09.197 --> 00:24:10.907
You can't do that to your mother.

00:24:11.491 --> 00:24:14.161
How bad is it between you two
that you keep dodging her calls?

00:24:15.912 --> 00:24:17.372
You're a horrible son.

00:24:26.298 --> 00:24:28.341
Why aren't you answering my calls?

00:24:28.967 --> 00:24:30.927
The money you send me
is downright insulting.

00:24:36.892 --> 00:24:37.893
Jun-seo.

00:24:39.644 --> 00:24:40.937
I'll give you a week.

00:24:42.355 --> 00:24:44.274
Wire the money within a week.

00:24:56.077 --> 00:25:00.332
Don't let my mom know
about Grandpa's condition.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.669
If she comes by, just send her away.

00:25:05.337 --> 00:25:07.339
Do you get what I'm saying?

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:10.217
Yes, I do.

00:25:10.634 --> 00:25:12.052
Don't worry, Mr. Yoon.

00:25:30.487 --> 00:25:31.571
All done, ma'am.

00:25:33.281 --> 00:25:34.407
Thank you.

00:26:04.229 --> 00:26:06.147
INVESTMENT AGREEMENT

00:26:06.231 --> 00:26:07.691
LONGSTAR ENTERTAINMENT

00:26:20.495 --> 00:26:21.538
Did you put him up to it?

00:26:21.955 --> 00:26:24.082
You made him invest
in your company, didn't you?

00:26:24.958 --> 00:26:26.668
You haven't changed one bit.

00:26:27.586 --> 00:26:28.587
Doesn't it get tiring?

00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:30.755
You talked him into it.

00:26:30.839 --> 00:26:32.632
You only play the mother
because you're after

00:26:32.716 --> 00:26:34.050
your illegitimate
child's inheritance.

00:26:34.134 --> 00:26:35.677
So you have no right
to say that to me.

00:26:38.221 --> 00:26:40.140
That doesn't work on me anymore.

00:26:40.223 --> 00:26:42.392
So, you want Jun-seo to die.

00:26:43.393 --> 00:26:44.394
Don't you know

00:26:44.894 --> 00:26:48.315
how much he loves
his dad and grandpa?

00:26:49.232 --> 00:26:51.526
If he finds out
he isn't the biological son

00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:52.777
what do you think will happen?

00:26:54.404 --> 00:26:56.197
If you're set on destroying him

00:26:56.281 --> 00:26:57.949
be my guest.

00:27:01.077 --> 00:27:02.078
I'm sick of this.

00:27:10.587 --> 00:27:11.588
Hi.

00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:16.635
Thank you.

00:27:17.677 --> 00:27:19.721
- Can we get a photo?
- Just one photo.

00:27:19.804 --> 00:27:20.805
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:27:22.432 --> 00:27:23.516
One, two, three.

00:27:26.227 --> 00:27:27.354
Don't cry.

00:27:28.813 --> 00:27:30.148
It's not over yet.

00:27:33.151 --> 00:27:35.028
You all need to know
what she really is!

00:27:35.111 --> 00:27:38.156
It was all her, you fucking idiots!

00:27:50.043 --> 00:27:53.672
You really thought
you could beat me, didn't you?

00:27:54.506 --> 00:27:58.343
Thank you for making my school life
so much less boring.

00:28:04.307 --> 00:28:06.893
I'm exposing
who Baek Ah-jin really is.

00:28:08.353 --> 00:28:11.439
We were classmates in 11th grade.

00:28:11.523 --> 00:28:13.525
She was the devil.

00:28:15.402 --> 00:28:18.655
She extorted money
from the other students at school.

00:28:19.114 --> 00:28:22.325
And she framed me for theft,
so I even had to transfer schools.

00:28:24.369 --> 00:28:28.790
What kind of messed-up world
lets someone like her be a celebrity?

00:28:29.416 --> 00:28:31.000
It's absurd.

00:28:32.669 --> 00:28:34.087
None of this is a lie.

00:28:34.587 --> 00:28:37.465
I'll answer any questions
you have for me.

00:28:37.882 --> 00:28:40.009
EXTORTION, BLACKMAIL
FALSE ACCUSATION

00:28:40.093 --> 00:28:41.302
RAN A STUDENT LOAN SCHEME...

00:28:41.386 --> 00:28:42.512
STIRRED UP TROUBLE...

00:28:44.431 --> 00:28:46.433
Is this for real, guys?

00:28:46.516 --> 00:28:50.270
Baek Ah-jin's shocking past
has been brought to light.

00:28:50.353 --> 00:28:53.231
A single post
on a forum is blowing up.

00:28:53.314 --> 00:28:55.692
"I'm exposing
who Baek Ah-jin really is.

00:28:55.775 --> 00:28:58.695
We were classmates in 11th grade.

00:28:58.778 --> 00:29:00.071
She was the devil."

00:29:00.155 --> 00:29:02.782
You can tell from the first line
that this is big.

00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:04.451
But this is where...

00:29:04.534 --> 00:29:06.995
I think I know who this is.
Are you Sim Sung-hee?

00:29:07.078 --> 00:29:08.371
Wait, I think I remember her.

00:29:08.455 --> 00:29:11.916
She stole stuff and spread rumors,
so she was transferred.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.836
Everyone who grew up in Nojeong-gu
knows who she is.

00:29:14.919 --> 00:29:17.172
If you have a conscience,
delete this post.

00:29:17.255 --> 00:29:18.715
Wow, she's still at it.

00:29:18.798 --> 00:29:22.135
Sung-hee,
you're still the same crazy bitch.

00:29:23.553 --> 00:29:25.054
It's not true.

00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:27.599
You saw how it was deleted instantly.

00:29:27.682 --> 00:29:30.226
I was a model student back in school.

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:35.774
Fine. I'll take your word for it.

00:29:37.066 --> 00:29:39.861
Fortunately, it doesn't look like
the media will blow it up.

00:29:40.737 --> 00:29:43.782
We'll chalk it up to
some hater acting out.

00:29:45.408 --> 00:29:48.411
On the bright side,
I'm receiving positive comments too.

00:29:48.495 --> 00:29:49.954
I get a little shy reading them.

00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:53.750
You think this is funny?

00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:58.713
You're really stressing me out here.

00:29:58.797 --> 00:30:02.050
Things like this
could come back to bite you.

00:30:02.133 --> 00:30:04.803
And that would be a real headache.

00:30:04.886 --> 00:30:06.596
Especially the reporters.

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:09.682
Be careful around them, okay?

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:12.685
I will. Don't worry.

00:30:12.977 --> 00:30:15.855
I'm trusting you on this.

00:30:19.651 --> 00:30:21.820
Will you be okay sleeping without me?

00:30:21.903 --> 00:30:23.655
Should I ask my grandma to come over?

00:30:24.239 --> 00:30:25.532
No, it's fine.

00:30:26.157 --> 00:30:28.451
I'll get some sleep
and call you later.

00:30:30.787 --> 00:30:33.122
Okay. Sleep tight.

00:31:22.463 --> 00:31:23.548
Ah-jin.

00:31:29.637 --> 00:31:30.722
Ah-jin.

00:31:33.308 --> 00:31:34.517
Ah-jin?

00:31:40.023 --> 00:31:41.441
- Ah-jin.
- Ah-jin!

00:31:52.368 --> 00:31:53.786
Ah-jin!

00:31:57.081 --> 00:31:58.166
Ah-jin.

00:31:59.959 --> 00:32:01.044
Ah-jin?

00:32:42.377 --> 00:32:44.128
How sick are you?

00:32:45.171 --> 00:32:47.715
What brings you here?

00:32:50.635 --> 00:32:54.889
You should have told me
if you were sick.

00:32:57.266 --> 00:32:58.476
Grandma.

00:32:59.435 --> 00:33:03.815
You should've rung the doorbell.
How long were you out there?

00:33:03.898 --> 00:33:05.608
Think about yourself right now.

00:33:06.734 --> 00:33:10.113
Do I have to hear from In-gang
that you're sick?

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:13.533
It must've been cold out there.

00:33:14.993 --> 00:33:17.912
You get used to the cold
when you're old.

00:33:22.625 --> 00:33:24.877
You must've been scared, dear.

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:30.174
Being alone
when you're sick is scary.

00:33:30.258 --> 00:33:31.259
Come on.

00:33:38.474 --> 00:33:40.018
Go on. Eat up.

00:34:02.999 --> 00:34:08.337
Once you get better,
let's go get some fresh air.

00:34:49.128 --> 00:34:51.214
I fed a stray once.

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:57.220
And the next day,
she came back with her kitten.

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:01.933
She must've wanted me to help.

00:35:03.267 --> 00:35:05.728
She must've wanted me
to help her kitten.

00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:09.315
Even that tiny creature was a mother.

00:35:11.484 --> 00:35:13.402
That's just how mothers are.

00:35:16.405 --> 00:35:19.117
She's such a pretty little thing.

00:35:20.326 --> 00:35:24.205
I'll show her to you someday.

00:35:26.124 --> 00:35:27.125
Okay.

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:33.381
Ah-jin.

00:35:34.841 --> 00:35:37.844
No matter what happens,
I'm on your side.

00:35:39.971 --> 00:35:43.558
Even if everything
they wrote about you was true

00:35:44.976 --> 00:35:49.272
I know you must've had your reasons.

00:35:52.108 --> 00:35:58.364
I know how gentle and kind you are.

00:36:02.785 --> 00:36:04.162
Everyone...

00:36:07.331 --> 00:36:09.750
says I'm a bad person.

00:36:15.423 --> 00:36:17.633
What am I...

00:36:20.011 --> 00:36:21.179
to you?

00:36:29.312 --> 00:36:30.688
A gift...

00:36:32.982 --> 00:36:36.527
A gift from my daughter.

00:36:37.445 --> 00:36:39.447
Just like In-gang and In-mo

00:36:40.448 --> 00:36:42.450
you're my child.

00:37:12.313 --> 00:37:13.314
Grandma.

00:37:13.856 --> 00:37:14.857
Yes?

00:37:16.317 --> 00:37:17.693
It's 1-2-2-5.

00:37:18.402 --> 00:37:19.779
What do you mean?

00:37:21.155 --> 00:37:22.448
It's my door code.

00:37:23.866 --> 00:37:26.369
You can come in anytime next time.

00:37:26.953 --> 00:37:28.996
Don't wait in the cold
like last night.

00:37:29.538 --> 00:37:30.748
It's 1-2-2-5.

00:37:31.374 --> 00:37:33.584
That's the day Jesus was born.

00:37:33.668 --> 00:37:35.211
He's Buddha's friend.

00:38:38.149 --> 00:38:40.192
How did you even get here?

00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:43.779
I tagged along on your business trip
as a little vacation.

00:38:43.863 --> 00:38:47.908
I missed you so much, In-gang.

00:38:50.536 --> 00:38:51.537
Hey.

00:38:51.912 --> 00:38:54.206
You looked great out there today.

00:38:54.290 --> 00:38:56.876
You literally killed it.

00:38:57.460 --> 00:38:58.753
I know you better than that.

00:39:03.799 --> 00:39:05.593
Why are you really here?

00:39:09.597 --> 00:39:12.391
It's about Director Yong's new work.

00:39:13.601 --> 00:39:15.853
We need to get back to him
by the end of the week.

00:39:15.936 --> 00:39:17.980
When are you going
to give me an answer?

00:39:18.064 --> 00:39:19.607
I knew you didn't just drop by.

00:39:20.149 --> 00:39:21.317
What's the holdup?

00:39:22.068 --> 00:39:24.070
You said you liked the script.

00:39:26.322 --> 00:39:27.323
Mi-ri.

00:39:27.406 --> 00:39:28.449
Yes?

00:39:30.076 --> 00:39:32.453
I'm thinking of doing something else.

00:39:32.536 --> 00:39:35.081
Something other
than dramas and movies?

00:39:35.164 --> 00:39:37.416
Do you want to be on variety shows?

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:38.709
No, it's not that.

00:39:39.293 --> 00:39:40.294
Then what?

00:39:42.463 --> 00:39:44.340
Do you think I'm allowed to be happy?

00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:47.635
Oh, my goodness.

00:39:48.386 --> 00:39:50.429
What are you talking about?

00:39:52.014 --> 00:39:54.225
Lately,
I keep finding myself thinking

00:39:56.102 --> 00:39:57.853
"I'm happy.

00:39:59.605 --> 00:40:01.357
This is what happiness feels like."

00:40:01.774 --> 00:40:05.069
Hold on to that feeling
and stay happy at work.

00:40:05.569 --> 00:40:07.530
When I'm with Ah-jin

00:40:08.906 --> 00:40:10.282
it feels like a dream.

00:40:12.076 --> 00:40:13.869
I catch myself smiling for no reason.

00:40:15.037 --> 00:40:16.455
People say I've gone mad.

00:40:17.998 --> 00:40:19.291
But I'm happy.

00:40:20.209 --> 00:40:23.587
I'm so happy that it scares me.

00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:27.341
I'm scared that this will end.

00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:29.760
I'm afraid I'll be the one...

00:40:33.389 --> 00:40:35.099
who destroys this happiness.

00:40:44.275 --> 00:40:45.568
Don't tell me you're...

00:40:45.985 --> 00:40:48.737
No. Stop jumping to conclusions.

00:40:50.656 --> 00:40:53.826
I went to the department store
to buy Ah-jin a birthday gift

00:40:53.909 --> 00:40:55.744
and happened to see some baby shoes.

00:40:56.495 --> 00:40:57.705
They were so cute.

00:41:00.207 --> 00:41:01.625
I didn't even need them

00:41:02.501 --> 00:41:05.212
but I couldn't walk away
from these tiny shoes.

00:41:05.713 --> 00:41:06.797
So I bought them.

00:41:13.387 --> 00:41:15.931
Are you considering marrying Ah-jin?

00:41:20.686 --> 00:41:22.229
Does she want to marry you?

00:41:24.565 --> 00:41:25.566
I'm not sure.

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:29.653
I hope she does.

00:41:33.073 --> 00:41:34.492
Look how small it is.

00:41:52.718 --> 00:41:53.719
Ah-jin.

00:42:15.366 --> 00:42:16.450
You seem surprised.

00:42:18.702 --> 00:42:21.247
No, I'm glad to see you.

00:42:26.168 --> 00:42:27.670
When did you get out?

00:42:28.003 --> 00:42:29.255
Not long ago.

00:42:30.631 --> 00:42:32.383
I was released sooner than expected.

00:42:37.846 --> 00:42:39.723
You look healthy.

00:42:46.313 --> 00:42:47.815
Are you at peace now?

00:42:49.567 --> 00:42:51.986
Yes, a little.

00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:53.862
And you got what you wanted?

00:42:59.451 --> 00:43:00.869
All thanks to you.

00:43:03.664 --> 00:43:05.165
And how do you think I am?

00:43:07.459 --> 00:43:09.086
You're a good person.

00:43:11.547 --> 00:43:13.757
I'm sure you can make it
through anything.

00:43:14.675 --> 00:43:15.801
"Good person"?

00:43:18.345 --> 00:43:20.639
How long do you think
I can stay that way?

00:43:25.644 --> 00:43:26.812
Look who it is!

00:43:27.688 --> 00:43:29.064
Jung-ho, is that you?

00:43:30.107 --> 00:43:31.317
What brings you here?

00:43:31.859 --> 00:43:35.904
You told me it was a beautiful temple
and said that I should stop by.

00:43:36.196 --> 00:43:37.197
How have you been?

00:43:37.573 --> 00:43:38.991
When did you get out?

00:43:39.074 --> 00:43:40.200
A couple of weeks ago.

00:43:41.118 --> 00:43:43.537
Goodness. You went through so much.

00:43:44.455 --> 00:43:46.457
This is my grandson.

00:43:47.499 --> 00:43:51.170
And she's
my older grandson's girlfriend.

00:43:51.253 --> 00:43:53.881
Ma'am, we've already met.

00:43:53.964 --> 00:43:55.799
You two know each other?

00:43:57.134 --> 00:43:58.135
Yes.

00:43:58.218 --> 00:44:01.305
I had to make ends meet
after graduating from high school

00:44:01.388 --> 00:44:03.098
and he helped me out a lot.

00:44:03.182 --> 00:44:04.183
I see.

00:44:04.892 --> 00:44:08.020
And I worked part-time
at his café for a year.

00:44:12.191 --> 00:44:15.110
How do you know Mrs. Hong?

00:44:16.111 --> 00:44:20.991
Well, we met at a temple...

00:44:21.075 --> 00:44:22.284
She came

00:44:23.869 --> 00:44:26.038
to volunteer at the prison I was in.

00:44:29.792 --> 00:44:32.336
Ma'am, I'll see you again soon.

00:44:33.003 --> 00:44:35.297
I've always wanted to buy you a meal.

00:44:35.381 --> 00:44:37.508
I'd love that.

00:44:37.591 --> 00:44:39.385
Hold on.

00:44:40.386 --> 00:44:42.179
- Give me your number.
- Sure.

00:44:46.141 --> 00:44:47.267
Here you go.

00:44:47.351 --> 00:44:49.853
I really hope we meet again.

00:44:50.604 --> 00:44:52.856
What a small world, you and Ah-jin.

00:45:18.257 --> 00:45:19.717
He still hasn't come home?

00:45:22.886 --> 00:45:23.887
You're home.

00:45:24.471 --> 00:45:25.806
What took you so long?

00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:27.891
I missed you like crazy.

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:39.820
Who are you?

00:45:48.245 --> 00:45:49.288
Who are you?

00:45:49.371 --> 00:45:51.081
Why did you barge into
someone else's home?

00:45:51.165 --> 00:45:53.083
Exactly! What are you doing
in someone else's house?

00:45:54.293 --> 00:45:56.670
- What a pervert.
- "Pervert"?

00:45:57.045 --> 00:45:58.380
Why did you hug me?

00:45:58.464 --> 00:46:00.591
You hugged me from behind!

00:46:00.674 --> 00:46:01.800
Unbelievable.

00:46:08.974 --> 00:46:09.975
Seriously.

00:46:10.893 --> 00:46:14.438
You hide in a man's house
and hug him.

00:46:15.105 --> 00:46:17.816
Check his face first
if you're going to hug him.

00:46:18.901 --> 00:46:21.445
I don't let just anyone
touch my body.

00:46:24.448 --> 00:46:26.950
Did I steal a kiss
or take your pants off?

00:46:27.785 --> 00:46:30.078
All I did was hug you from behind.

00:46:30.162 --> 00:46:31.413
I'm the one who's offended.

00:46:31.872 --> 00:46:33.332
But I'm the victim.

00:46:36.627 --> 00:46:38.504
Jun-seo, that inconsiderate jerk.

00:46:39.004 --> 00:46:40.756
He should have warned me.

00:46:41.131 --> 00:46:43.050
Guess he doesn't
tell you much either.

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:47.805
Let me ask you something.

00:46:48.722 --> 00:46:49.973
What are you two?

00:46:53.101 --> 00:46:55.229
You know what? Never mind.

00:46:55.312 --> 00:46:56.647
I don't even have to ask.

00:46:57.147 --> 00:46:59.566
You wait for him at home and hug him.

00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:01.360
That says it all.

00:47:02.361 --> 00:47:03.362
I'm out.

00:47:03.695 --> 00:47:04.905
What's your name?

00:47:07.616 --> 00:47:08.617
Why do you ask?

00:47:08.992 --> 00:47:13.956
We may be strangers,
but we did share a hug.

00:47:14.331 --> 00:47:17.251
- Excuse me?
- I've never met his friend before.

00:47:18.544 --> 00:47:22.381
I didn't know he had any friends,
so I figured I should get your name.

00:47:22.756 --> 00:47:24.091
Ask him yourself.

00:47:30.681 --> 00:47:32.683
Haven't we met before, though?

00:47:32.975 --> 00:47:35.352
Not "we". You must've seen me.

00:47:36.061 --> 00:47:37.062
On TV.

00:47:38.313 --> 00:47:39.314
TV?

00:47:43.235 --> 00:47:44.444
Right?

00:47:44.528 --> 00:47:45.654
The celebrity!

00:47:46.071 --> 00:47:48.156
The has-been--

00:47:55.664 --> 00:47:56.665
Sorry.

00:48:13.891 --> 00:48:15.100
Hey, boss!

00:48:16.226 --> 00:48:17.394
Is it really you?

00:48:18.145 --> 00:48:20.272
It's been a while, Jae-oh.

00:48:22.024 --> 00:48:23.150
Is something wrong?

00:48:23.942 --> 00:48:26.236
No. Not yet.

00:48:28.447 --> 00:48:30.449
What is it? You can tell me.

00:48:33.201 --> 00:48:34.202
Okay.

00:48:36.079 --> 00:48:37.080
All right.

00:48:38.081 --> 00:48:40.000
Send me his info
as soon as you get it.

00:48:41.126 --> 00:48:42.127
All right.

00:48:58.477 --> 00:48:59.645
Did Ah-jin call you?

00:49:01.188 --> 00:49:02.356
How did you know?

00:49:03.148 --> 00:49:05.984
You make a certain face
when you talk to her.

00:49:06.443 --> 00:49:07.486
What face?

00:49:09.863 --> 00:49:11.531
That's a face I want to punch.

00:49:11.615 --> 00:49:12.824
Imagine how I felt.

00:49:17.788 --> 00:49:19.665
If she's calling me

00:49:21.375 --> 00:49:23.085
that means something's up.

00:49:23.669 --> 00:49:25.128
Something doesn't feel right.

00:49:25.587 --> 00:49:26.964
How did she sound?

00:49:27.464 --> 00:49:29.883
More depressed than usual.

00:49:33.387 --> 00:49:34.596
Maybe I'm mistaken.

00:49:37.933 --> 00:49:39.393
What did she want?

00:49:41.603 --> 00:49:43.522
She told me not to tell you.

00:49:48.944 --> 00:49:51.780
Also, don't go home tonight.

00:49:52.072 --> 00:49:53.240
There's a crazy girl.

00:50:18.181 --> 00:50:22.644
There's good news shaking
both the literary and film worlds.

00:50:22.728 --> 00:50:24.813
A bestselling novel
that stirred major buzz

00:50:24.896 --> 00:50:27.274
is finally headed to the big screen.

00:50:27.357 --> 00:50:30.068
Author Yoon Seok-ha,
winner of the Ennoble Literary Award

00:50:30.152 --> 00:50:32.195
has announced that his latest work,
Winter Sleep

00:50:32.279 --> 00:50:34.072
is being adapted into a film.

00:50:34.156 --> 00:50:36.533
Winter Sleep is a novel
about a man and a woman

00:50:36.616 --> 00:50:38.618
who reunite after parting ways

00:50:38.702 --> 00:50:43.874
slowly healing their past wounds
and rebuilding their love together.

00:50:43.957 --> 00:50:47.627
Meanwhile, Yoon Seok-ha was spotted
on a date with actress Lena

00:50:47.711 --> 00:50:49.254
sparking romance rumors.

00:50:49.337 --> 00:50:52.007
With Lena's name being mentioned
as the heroine of Winter Sleep

00:50:52.090 --> 00:50:54.968
the online communities
are buzzing with speculation.

00:50:56.845 --> 00:50:58.555
CEO YOON JUN-SEO

00:51:12.611 --> 00:51:15.322
You're Mr. Yoon Jun-seo, right?

00:51:16.698 --> 00:51:17.991
Do you know me?

00:51:19.826 --> 00:51:23.497
We haven't met,
but I know enough about you.

00:51:30.337 --> 00:51:32.672
It's surprising enough that you,
the author of Winter Sleep

00:51:32.756 --> 00:51:36.218
had been an anonymous investor
in Longstar for the past year.

00:51:36.676 --> 00:51:40.097
But it turns out you were
Ah-jin's secret benefactor too.

00:51:42.099 --> 00:51:43.266
Is Ah-jin doing okay?

00:51:43.809 --> 00:51:45.644
So you haven't seen her lately?

00:51:45.727 --> 00:51:48.355
Are you curious
about her and In-gang?

00:51:48.605 --> 00:51:51.108
I just want her happy.

00:51:51.483 --> 00:51:56.571
She's confident and ambitious.
And she's loaded with talent.

00:51:56.655 --> 00:51:59.282
When she wants something,
she goes straight for it.

00:51:59.366 --> 00:52:02.244
And she can be mesmerizing
when needed.

00:52:02.327 --> 00:52:04.579
Is actor Heo In-gang okay?

00:52:06.498 --> 00:52:08.708
Thanks for asking about him too.

00:52:10.085 --> 00:52:14.714
I was worried myself,
but he's happier than ever.

00:52:17.926 --> 00:52:21.221
In-gang isn't just one of our actors.

00:52:21.304 --> 00:52:23.515
He's like a brother
I deeply care about.

00:52:23.974 --> 00:52:27.769
I would never let anything
make him unhappy.

00:52:28.353 --> 00:52:30.814
I would never let anything
make Ah-jin unhappy, either.

00:52:30.897 --> 00:52:33.191
You also need to honor
the contract terms.

00:52:33.942 --> 00:52:34.943
We will.

00:52:37.154 --> 00:52:39.364
Ah-jin's burnt out,
even if she won't say it.

00:52:39.447 --> 00:52:40.866
She needs rest.

00:52:41.241 --> 00:52:43.076
She's in her mid-20s.

00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:45.370
She should be working, not resting.

00:52:46.037 --> 00:52:47.998
It's not about age.

00:52:48.415 --> 00:52:50.709
Don't tell me you're
seriously considering marrying her.

00:52:52.085 --> 00:52:54.713
She has a big future ahead of her.

00:52:55.213 --> 00:52:57.215
Don't think about tying her down.

00:52:57.841 --> 00:53:00.510
Why does it have to be her
for that show?

00:53:01.219 --> 00:53:03.263
That was the author's condition.

00:53:03.346 --> 00:53:05.849
Studios are desperate
to adapt Winter Sleep

00:53:05.932 --> 00:53:08.268
so the competition was fierce.

00:53:08.727 --> 00:53:12.480
What let our company win the bid
was exactly that condition.

00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:16.735
This is hard, In-gang.

00:53:17.777 --> 00:53:18.778
Let's talk later.

00:53:30.457 --> 00:53:31.541
Author Yoon Seok-ha?

00:53:32.584 --> 00:53:33.585
What about him?

00:53:34.169 --> 00:53:35.170
You didn't see the news?

00:53:36.129 --> 00:53:37.672
They say he's dating Lena.

00:53:37.756 --> 00:53:39.549
Really? Good for them.

00:53:42.219 --> 00:53:47.265
He's insisting that you star
in the drama adaptation of his work.

00:53:49.351 --> 00:53:51.353
That was his condition
for investing in our company.

00:53:53.271 --> 00:53:54.272
I heard.

00:53:56.358 --> 00:53:57.359
You knew?

00:53:57.692 --> 00:53:59.402
The script was decent.

00:53:59.986 --> 00:54:02.113
So I told him
I'd discuss it with you.

00:54:02.864 --> 00:54:05.867
It seems that Ms. Seo
really wants me to do it.

00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:07.869
What do you think?

00:54:09.913 --> 00:54:13.458
Let's think it over for one week.

00:54:14.125 --> 00:54:15.126
Okay.

00:54:44.364 --> 00:54:45.365
You're late.

00:54:49.077 --> 00:54:50.120
You're the one who's late.

00:54:51.037 --> 00:54:52.706
It's been over a year.

00:54:53.206 --> 00:54:56.543
You promised you'd come back.

00:54:59.838 --> 00:55:01.881
Congratulations, you pulled it off.

00:55:04.718 --> 00:55:07.929
You blackmailed Ms. Seo with money,
poked at In-gang

00:55:08.013 --> 00:55:09.639
and made me come to you.

00:55:11.808 --> 00:55:12.809
I'm impressed.

00:55:13.268 --> 00:55:15.395
You're the one making me this way.

00:55:18.273 --> 00:55:19.649
Ms. Seo told me.

00:55:21.901 --> 00:55:22.944
Why?

00:55:24.696 --> 00:55:25.864
I wanted to help you.

00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:29.034
That's my duty, isn't it?

00:55:31.161 --> 00:55:32.162
It always has been.

00:55:32.245 --> 00:55:35.206
- What do you want me to do?
- That's my question.

00:55:36.583 --> 00:55:38.918
Isn't it time to end it with In-gang?

00:55:39.961 --> 00:55:40.962
Why?

00:55:42.756 --> 00:55:44.466
Did you actually
fall in love with him?

00:55:53.892 --> 00:55:54.893
What about you?

00:55:56.102 --> 00:55:59.022
I heard you were dating Lena.

00:55:59.439 --> 00:56:00.440
Yes.

00:56:01.316 --> 00:56:02.317
Why?

00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:05.528
- Does it bother you?
- She used to torment me.

00:56:06.279 --> 00:56:07.947
You don't know what she'll pull.

00:56:08.031 --> 00:56:09.991
All the more reason
to keep her close.

00:56:10.075 --> 00:56:12.660
So I can stop her
from getting to you.

00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:19.959
Something's different

00:56:21.252 --> 00:56:22.253
about you.

00:56:23.505 --> 00:56:24.589
People...

00:56:29.302 --> 00:56:30.387
change.

00:56:45.527 --> 00:56:46.653
You didn't eat, right?

00:56:52.909 --> 00:56:54.119
Hi, Lena.

00:56:56.162 --> 00:56:57.247
Why are you here?

00:56:59.290 --> 00:57:00.458
Explain.

00:57:00.542 --> 00:57:02.877
- We were talking.
- "Talking"?

00:57:02.961 --> 00:57:05.547
Then, do it outside, not here.

00:57:06.089 --> 00:57:09.592
Does In-gang know you're here?

00:57:10.468 --> 00:57:11.469
Actually...

00:57:11.970 --> 00:57:15.014
Can you two
even make your relationship public?

00:57:18.143 --> 00:57:19.227
Do as you please.

00:57:19.853 --> 00:57:20.854
Hey.

00:57:20.937 --> 00:57:22.939
You think I won't?

00:57:23.022 --> 00:57:25.316
Let go! This is so wrong!

00:57:30.822 --> 00:57:32.240
I tailed him for a few days.

00:57:32.323 --> 00:57:35.034
He went to pay respects to your dad.
He cried and apologized.

00:57:35.785 --> 00:57:36.995
He still hasn't changed.

00:57:37.662 --> 00:57:38.663
Is that all?

00:57:38.746 --> 00:57:41.583
He usually does volunteer work
in the afternoon and goes home.

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:44.043
He doesn't drink or meet his friends.

00:57:44.127 --> 00:57:46.671
When there's no volunteer work,
he goes to the gym

00:57:47.255 --> 00:57:48.673
or reads at a café.

00:57:49.716 --> 00:57:51.050
I don't think you need to worry.

00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:53.261
Okay.

00:57:59.142 --> 00:58:00.226
Is dating fun?

00:58:01.603 --> 00:58:02.604
Why do you ask?

00:58:05.064 --> 00:58:06.065
Because it looks like it.

00:58:06.858 --> 00:58:08.067
You don't call me

00:58:09.861 --> 00:58:11.029
because you're doing well.

00:58:12.363 --> 00:58:15.200
Yes, I'm doing well. I'm happy.

00:58:27.378 --> 00:58:28.963
Did you look into
that exposé about Ah-jin?

00:58:29.255 --> 00:58:30.256
How did it go?

00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:32.967
It was deleted
an hour after it was posted.

00:58:33.051 --> 00:58:34.677
And the source is unverified.

00:58:35.011 --> 00:58:36.471
"Can't and won't."

00:58:37.639 --> 00:58:39.641
You think I pay you to hear that?

00:58:40.016 --> 00:58:42.352
When did I ever say
that I can't or won't?

00:58:43.228 --> 00:58:45.313
Give me some time. I'm still digging.

00:58:47.482 --> 00:58:48.483
Dong-gyu, it's me.

00:58:49.192 --> 00:58:50.193
Lena.

00:58:50.944 --> 00:58:53.905
Do you know
where In-gang is right now?

00:59:01.913 --> 00:59:02.914
Where are we going?

00:59:04.123 --> 00:59:06.626
You'll see. It'll be fun.

00:59:24.269 --> 00:59:25.770
Happy birthday, Ah-jin.

00:59:26.312 --> 00:59:27.313
Thanks.

00:59:44.372 --> 00:59:47.166
This might be cringe

00:59:48.167 --> 00:59:49.836
so please don't laugh.

00:59:50.962 --> 00:59:52.046
What's it about?

00:59:53.172 --> 00:59:54.173
Go on.

01:00:00.179 --> 01:00:01.723
I'm so grateful

01:00:03.308 --> 01:00:04.559
you were born

01:00:05.643 --> 01:00:07.562
and that you came into my life.

01:00:11.357 --> 01:00:14.694
It's been a year,
and when I'm with you

01:00:16.529 --> 01:00:17.614
my heart still races.

01:00:18.781 --> 01:00:24.454
This might be sudden,
but I hope you won't say no.

01:00:28.750 --> 01:00:31.586
They must have told me
the wrong floor.

01:00:35.882 --> 01:00:36.883
In-gang.

01:00:38.134 --> 01:00:40.845
What are you doing here with Ah-jin?

01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:46.309
- Can't you tell?
- A date?

01:00:46.392 --> 01:00:47.894
Oh, it's your birthday.

01:00:49.604 --> 01:00:51.189
Happy birthday.

01:00:53.608 --> 01:00:55.526
I'm also here on a date.

01:00:56.110 --> 01:00:58.529
Since we're all here,
why don't we celebrate together?

01:00:59.906 --> 01:01:01.616
Is that okay, Jun-seo?

01:01:06.204 --> 01:01:07.664
Mind if I sit?

01:01:08.498 --> 01:01:09.707
Take a seat, Jun-seo.

01:01:27.225 --> 01:01:31.854
That's right. I heard you two
used to be classmates.

01:01:33.022 --> 01:01:34.774
We live in such a small world.

01:01:35.817 --> 01:01:37.110
What a coincidence.

01:01:39.612 --> 01:01:40.613
Classmates?

01:01:42.532 --> 01:01:43.908
Technically

01:01:44.992 --> 01:01:46.285
we were siblings.

01:01:46.369 --> 01:01:49.288
Our parents remarried
when we were young.

01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:56.379
It's not exactly my favorite memory.

01:01:57.755 --> 01:01:58.756
Yeah?

01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:00.341
Why?

01:02:01.509 --> 01:02:06.556
My mother didn't treat her
so well back then.

01:02:08.057 --> 01:02:09.642
Because of that

01:02:10.810 --> 01:02:13.604
I still feel guilty

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:17.024
and am willing to do
anything for her.

01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:19.068
You don't have to.

01:02:19.819 --> 01:02:21.154
I've gotten over it.

01:02:24.615 --> 01:02:25.616
I'm fine.

01:02:27.118 --> 01:02:28.119
You're right.

01:02:30.455 --> 01:02:32.457
You look fine. I'm happy for you.

01:02:34.584 --> 01:02:35.668
Happy birthday.

01:02:43.676 --> 01:02:45.762
I should congratulate
you two as well.

01:02:45.845 --> 01:02:47.263
We're just friends.

01:02:51.309 --> 01:02:52.310
He's right.

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:56.063
We're only using each other.

01:02:59.358 --> 01:03:03.237
By the way, why did you come
to Jun-seo's place the other night?

01:03:03.821 --> 01:03:05.281
It was so late at night.

01:03:05.865 --> 01:03:07.408
You really scared me.

01:03:08.117 --> 01:03:09.202
That was

01:03:10.828 --> 01:03:12.121
because

01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:16.959
I wanted to politely turn down
Winter Sleep.

01:03:20.546 --> 01:03:21.547
What's wrong?

01:03:22.715 --> 01:03:25.259
How do you tell such a blatant lie
with a smile on your face?

01:03:26.219 --> 01:03:29.514
That was not the vibe
I picked up from them.

01:03:32.225 --> 01:03:33.726
It's her birthday.

01:03:34.769 --> 01:03:37.146
Take it down a notch.
We're here to celebrate.

01:03:41.776 --> 01:03:43.110
You'll have to excuse us.

01:03:59.836 --> 01:04:02.088
I want you to be straight with me.

01:04:03.214 --> 01:04:04.382
Is it me or Ah-jin?

01:04:05.299 --> 01:04:06.843
Do you even want to help me?

01:04:07.426 --> 01:04:08.845
Whatever you do

01:04:09.929 --> 01:04:12.306
- In-gang won't go back to you.
- I know that.

01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:13.975
You think I'm doing this
to win him back?

01:04:14.517 --> 01:04:18.062
Why her, though,
out of all the women?

01:04:19.063 --> 01:04:20.439
There's something wrong with her.

01:04:21.023 --> 01:04:23.109
Didn't you see how brazen she was

01:04:23.192 --> 01:04:25.444
when her relationship
with you was exposed?

01:04:25.778 --> 01:04:28.698
She's a really bad person.

01:04:28.781 --> 01:04:30.449
Do you really not see it?

01:04:30.533 --> 01:04:33.703
Why does no one see it but me?

01:04:58.394 --> 01:04:59.896
Oh, dear.

01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:36.766
Are you two really siblings?

01:05:37.934 --> 01:05:38.935
Yes.

01:05:39.685 --> 01:05:40.686
We were.

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:42.772
Why didn't you tell me?

01:05:46.859 --> 01:05:49.654
I didn't tell you
because you never asked.

01:05:50.738 --> 01:05:52.573
You can ask me anything.

01:05:53.115 --> 01:05:54.241
I'll answer.

01:06:00.164 --> 01:06:01.415
Just siblings?

01:06:02.375 --> 01:06:03.542
Not anymore.

01:06:05.127 --> 01:06:07.296
Our parents got divorced.

01:06:08.881 --> 01:06:09.882
I'm sorry.

01:06:12.343 --> 01:06:13.594
For what?

01:06:15.763 --> 01:06:16.764
One second.

01:06:19.266 --> 01:06:20.851
Hey, In-mo. What's up?

01:06:25.022 --> 01:06:26.023
What?

01:06:27.316 --> 01:06:28.401
She found it?

01:06:30.069 --> 01:06:31.070
What is it?

01:06:31.529 --> 01:06:33.739
My grandma found the notebook
she lost last year.

01:06:36.325 --> 01:06:37.410
She did?

01:06:38.452 --> 01:06:39.453
Okay.

01:06:40.287 --> 01:06:41.288
All right.

01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:46.085
The notebook?

01:06:46.752 --> 01:06:50.673
She used to write in it like a diary,
but she lost it last year.

01:06:51.257 --> 01:06:52.258
She found that.

01:06:53.801 --> 01:06:56.512
She went to your place
to cook a birthday meal for you

01:06:56.595 --> 01:06:59.807
but now she's lying down
and hasn't eaten anything.

01:07:00.474 --> 01:07:04.437
In-mo's out of town, so she's alone.
And I have to catch a flight tonight.

01:07:08.357 --> 01:07:09.358
Ah-jin.

01:07:10.568 --> 01:07:12.028
Can you check on her for me?

01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:23.998
It feels like we crashed
your birthday party.

01:07:26.333 --> 01:07:27.334
Ah-jin.

01:07:29.086 --> 01:07:30.421
Happy birthday.

01:07:31.505 --> 01:07:34.050
We'll head out. Have a great time.

01:08:06.248 --> 01:08:07.583
It's 1-2-2-5.

01:08:08.417 --> 01:08:10.753
You can come in anytime next time.

01:08:56.841 --> 01:08:57.925
Wait out here.

01:10:02.531 --> 01:10:03.532
You're here.

01:10:26.055 --> 01:10:27.056
How did it go?

01:10:27.806 --> 01:10:28.807
Nothing yet.

01:10:45.616 --> 01:10:46.617
Ah-jin.

01:12:08.907 --> 01:12:13.329
DEAR X

01:14:32.843 --> 01:14:34.845
