[Adapted from the novel "My Queen" by Xie Lounan]

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.980
[Episode 14]

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.900
The realm's foundation

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.410
lies with a worthy heir.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.380
The peace of the four corners

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.100
rests on his rightful line.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.460
I rule all under heaven,

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.770
bearing the enduring mandate of the divinities,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.340
and the weight of all my people.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.330
Yet I am laid low by illness

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.900
and my health has not returned.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.900
Remnant rebels still lurk,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.570
the Central Plains are racked by war,

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.180
and the great affairs of war and state

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.740
demand careful counsel and decision.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.290
Thus I appoint Prince of Yuzhang, Xiao Qianqing,

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.820
granting him power over rewards and punishments,

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.220
and entrusting him with all military and state affairs.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.730
By this decree, he shall act as Regent.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.410
We'll do all we can to assist Your Highness.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.450
I second that.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.170
His Majesty has spoken.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.220
I will serve as Regent for now.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.690
Ministers,

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.610
do you have any matters to report?

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.380
Your Highness,

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:49.690
some time ago,

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.100
the Empress fell ill

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.220
and went to the imperial retreat to recover.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.260
But now,

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.500
His Majesty is unwell as well.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.940
Ever since Her Majesty was enthroned,

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.980
misfortunes have plagued the palace.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.780
I worry that when their birth dates were matched,

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.170
something may have gone wrong.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.340
You mean

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.260
their birth charts don't match?

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.610
Utter nonsense!

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.970
His Majesty only fell ill

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.980
from all these recent disasters and troubles.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.820
It has nothing to do with the Empress.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.290
Minister Xing is deliberately finding fault with Her Majesty.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.260
Such behavior is disrespectful!

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.340
Please judge fairly, Your Highness.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.980
In matters this serious,

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.060
it's not my place to decide.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.610
Grand Tutor Ling, why don't you ask His Majesty

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.100
and look in on the Empress as well?

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.290
Enough.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.660
This kind of talk

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.940
ends here.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.690
I ask you all not to gossip idly about the Emperor and Empress.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.340
Let us focus our minds on state affairs.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.540
Kumor's siege of Jiangzhou

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.890
has yet to be broken.

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:11.780
Grand Tutor Ling,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.940
what do you think?

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.610
I agree.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.020
Your Highness is absolutely right.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.170
The crisis in Jiangzhou concerns the very foundation of our state.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.490
As for the second batch of grain for Jiangzhou,

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.930
I urge Your Highness to send it out as soon as possible.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.370
- Yes. - Indeed.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.930
How is the disaster situation in Xuzhou?

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.290
I have received word

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.580
that the locust plague in Xuzhou is growing ever worse,

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.810
and the relief grain is but a drop in the bucket.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.050
The supplies we sent earlier are nearly gone.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.980
Both Jiangzhou and Xuzhou

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.370
are crying out for grain.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.170
What are we to do?

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.810
They are all subjects of Great Qi.

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.930
I am truly troubled by this.

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:19.410
Eunuch Feng,

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.660
my head aches terribly.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.290
Let us adjourn court for today.

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.100
We will discuss this another day.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.980
Yes, of course.

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:36.730
We respectfully see Your Highness out.

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.940
[Ling Manor]

[Brush and Ink]

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.100
It's one thing

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.810
for Prince of Yuzhang to throw his weight around,

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.100
but what was he playing at

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.140
in court today?

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.900
He wouldn't even release the grain for Jiangzhou,

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.730
yet he deliberately steered things to the locust plague in Xuzhou.

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.460
The grain in the state granary

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:20.700
was clearly raised by the Grand Tutor himself

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.980
from the grain merchants!

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.170
Exactly.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.370
The military situation in Jiangzhou is urgent.

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:28.850
The border war concerns the very foundation of the realm.

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:31.370
The locust plague in Xuzhou is an internal trouble at best.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:32.700
What matters most now

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:35.850
is to secure supplies for the border troops.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:36.980
Given how things stand,

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.410
we might as well go straight to His Majesty

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:40.780
and lodge a complaint against Prince of Yuzhang!

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:42.220
- Yes! - Exactly!

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.020
Enough.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.280
As for the grain,

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.930
I know what to do.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.660
It's getting late.

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:54.700
Sirs,

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:55.980
you may all retire.

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:12.170
My Lord.

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:16.340
You will depart for Xuzhou at once.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.460
Tell the Governor of Xuzhou

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:21.750
that I've backed him every step of the way to where he is now,

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:23.900
and it's about time

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.190
he repaid the favor.

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:27.880
Yes, My Lord.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.610
I don't care what the disaster in Xuzhou is really like.

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:37.930
The report that comes back to the Capital

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:39.020
must say...

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:41.850
the locust plague has passed.

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:46.140
Send this to the Governor of Xuzhou as well.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:50.980
At once, My Lord.

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.140
A child playing at power?

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.910
Xiao Qianqing,

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:03.730
since you insist on hearing about Xuzhou's disaster,

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.170
I'll make sure you get an answer

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.480
that you'll be pleased with.

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:14.900
When you presided over court as Regent today,

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:17.020
did Ling Xuefeng give you a hard time?

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.370
He wouldn't dare.

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:20.900
I'm not as mild-tempered as my brother.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.850
If that old man ever tries to push me,

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:23.460
I'll...

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:25.370
I'll drive him mad.

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:30.220
I never expected Xiao Huan

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:32.770
to make a move like this.

00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:35.100
Making you Regent

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:38.940
might be to pit you against Ling Xuefeng.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.250
Don't let yourself

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:43.820
be used as someone else's blade.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:46.850
He...

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:49.460
really is seriously ill?

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:52.700
When I saw him last night,

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.580
he looked in terrible shape,

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:56.100
like he might not make it.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.730
His retreat is sealed up tight.

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:01.940
I can't get any of my people in at all.

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:04.820
I truly don't know what game he's playing.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.460
Now he's dumped this mess on you.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.370
Is he hoping you'll stumble

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:13.370
so he can send you back to Southern Chu?

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:16.100
Then we'll see if he really has that ability.

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:18.490
My brother

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:20.530
has always been deeply scheming.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.420
Every step he takes,

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:25.130
he's already planned three moves ahead.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:26.820
It even exhausts me just watching him.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.850
But this time, I won't let him lead me by the nose.

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:31.870
All right, Mother,

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:32.940
let's not talk about him.

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:35.980
How has Ying been lately?

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:38.180
Get out!

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:39.490
I told you I'm not eating!

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:40.530
Stop bothering me!

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:44.890
Li Hongqing!

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:47.770
You're here.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.180
Your Highness.

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:54.010
What took you so long?

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.890
Come with me.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.980
Look what I've prepared for you.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.820
I studied all kinds of venomous snakes myself

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.610
to make this jar of powder that wards off every snake.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:20.610
Here, take it.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.250
Impressive, right?

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.650
So Guard Wang Xiong

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.730
almost lost his life

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.460
because of this "research" of yours?

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:34.650
He really was bitten by a venomous snake.

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:36.820
How long will you keep making trouble like this?

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:40.250
Being a princess doesn't mean you can do whatever you want

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:41.610
and ignore other people's lives!

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:45.890
I didn't.

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:48.060
Have you forgotten?

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.300
You ordered people

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.490
to lock him in with those snakes.

00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:51.730
He nearly died!

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:55.460
But...

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:57.300
he told me

00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:58.980
he grew up in the south

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.580
and wasn't afraid of snakes.

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:02.940
And besides,

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:05.420
I even gave him protection.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:07.940
I never meant to harm him.

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:09.890
I didn't...

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.220
I never wanted to hurt him.

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:16.580
I never wanted to hurt him.

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:18.460
It's you,

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:19.820
all of you...

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:21.850
You're the ones trying to hurt me,

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:24.340
every last one of you!

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.130
Only when you stand firm at court

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:32.250
will Ying and I really have support.

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:35.650
If we can get rid of Ling Xuefeng while you're still Regent,

00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:37.250
even better.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.820
We have to seize this chance.

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:42.300
The more serious the disaster becomes,

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.100
the more it works in our favor.

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:45.010
However,

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.060
we have to know where to draw the line.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.010
Your Majesty,

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.650
Eunuch Feng is waiting outside,

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:58.060
urging His Highness to review today's memorials.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:02.980
Understood.

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:06.530
Mother,

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:07.850
I'll take my leave.

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:25.660
[Xuanguang Gate]

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:26.820
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:28.530
Your Highness,

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:30.300
it's getting late.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.980
Should we move to Wuying Hall now?

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.130
What's the rush?

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.060
These memorials will never run out.

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:38.370
Let's just

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:39.130
wait a little longer.

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:40.300
Your Highness,

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:41.420
how about this?

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:42.650
If there's anything you need done,

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:44.460
I can handle it for you.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:45.770
Oh?

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:47.850
I'm going to visit my sister.

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:49.060
Can you do that in my place as well?

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:50.940
I wouldn't dare.

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:52.060
But...

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.820
Just give me a moment.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.130
Once I've checked on my sister,

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:56.770
I'll dutifully go through the memorials.

00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:57.530
All right?

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.850
Why not find someone to haul me back?

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:02.580
Your Highness.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.460
Listen, Your Highness...

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.130
Qianqing!

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:35.370
These are all new poisons I cooked up in secret.

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:36.580
When you have time,

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:38.650
try them out on Xiao Huan!

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:44.420
Ying,

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:46.580
you need to behave.

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:47.850
Promise me,

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.700
don't hurt people with poison anymore,

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:51.580
all right?

00:13:58.870 --> 00:13:59.850
Why?

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:06.680
Do you all think

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:08.730
I'll end up killing someone?

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:11.850
I never meant to hurt anyone.

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:13.980
Except Xiao Huan,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.370
I've never wanted to hurt anyone else.

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:18.890
You have to believe me.

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:19.650
I do.

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:21.100
Of course I believe you.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.130
You're so kind.

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:25.060
How could you possibly want to hurt anyone?

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:26.850
Guard Wang was poisoned by that snake.

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:28.220
It clearly wasn't my fault,

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:31.530
yet Li Hongqing is still angry.

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:33.250
He blames me,

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:34.700
and I'm not happy about it.

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:37.060
Then,

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.010
let's drag Li Hongqing over here

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:39.890
and teach him a lesson.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:41.780
Better not.

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:43.480
I won't lower myself to his level.

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:55.850
You like him?

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:01.730
Then if we drag Li Hongqing over

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:02.890
and make him my brother-in-law,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:03.890
that wouldn't be so bad.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.420
I don't like him at all.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:08.610
How about this?

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:10.460
I'll bring him here

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:11.530
and make him apologize to you.

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:12.340
What do you think?

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:15.300
Really?

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:17.730
When have I ever lied to you?

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:41.850
If you could stay this simple and happy

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:43.700
and keep living in your own little world,

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:45.610
it might be a blessing in its own way.

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:48.180
Without facing people's tangled schemes,

00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:50.850
you wouldn't be hurt even more.

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:57.130
Your Highness,

00:15:57.390 --> 00:15:58.460
time's up.

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:00.530
You need to go back and review the memorials.

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:06.770
Ying,

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:09.820
time's almost up.

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.340
I have to go.

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:12.940
I'll come see you next time.

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:17.590
Qianqing.

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:22.730
Could you give me some silver?

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.130
What do you need silver for?

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:26.220
I need it.

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:29.250
For something very important!

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:53.730
Your Majesty,

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:55.610
did you sleep well?

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:00.940
I prepared this especially for you.

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:02.610
Have a taste.

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:08.010
I stole your grain,

00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:10.180
yet now you are letting bygones be bygones

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:13.290
and treating me like an honored guest?

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:15.900
That's a separate matter.

00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:18.180
You robbed my grain,

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.250
and I almost used you as an offering to rally my troops.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.620
The supplies are already on their way.

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:27.220
You won't so much as shake me.

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:42.140
Your Majesty,

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:43.620
please.

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.530
Then I won't stand on ceremony.

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:00.770
Please enjoy, Your Majesty.

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:02.940
I told you, I'm not the Empress.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.860
You're not the Empress?

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:10.010
Then who are you?

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:11.290
My surname is Lin,

00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:11.940
L-i-n.

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:12.770
I'm Lin Cangcang.

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:15.490
Then how do you explain...

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:20.290
this Phoenix Seal?

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.380
I stole it.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:36.810
You stole it?

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:43.570
The Phoenix Seal belongs to the Empress.

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:46.220
It's kept safe deep in the palace.

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:47.770
How did you steal it?

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:50.180
With my skills,

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.860
stealing it was child's play.

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.090
What's so strange about that?

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:55.900
But, of all the things you could steal,

00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:58.090
why steal the Phoenix Seal?

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:02.290
Well,

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:04.810
that's a long story.

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:05.860
No rush.

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:08.660
I've got

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:10.220
plenty of time.

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:18.810
Have you heard of the Lingbi Sect?

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:19.730
Heard of it.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.700
It's pretty famous.

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.860
They say the Lingbi Sect leader's token

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:26.180
ended up in the Emperor's hands.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:27.700
That's actually what I went in to steal.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:28.980
But somehow,

00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:31.050
I ended up with this thing instead.

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:34.700
Then why did you join the army?

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:37.140
Pure coincidence.

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:38.620
I left the palace in armor,

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:39.940
ran into the reinforcements heading west,

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:41.140
and they brought me out of the city.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.730
You really took the long way around.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.420
And you just slipped into the reinforcements like that?

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:49.330
Is it impossible?

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:51.090
Sure, it's possible.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.810
But from the Capital to Jiangzhou is a long road.

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:57.010
Why didn't you run off on the way?

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:58.380
Why would I run?

00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:59.460
There's food in the army,

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:00.420
and the marching isn't hard.

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:01.660
Besides,

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.700
once I got here, I even earned merit.

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:05.530
So why not wait till I get my pay?

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:07.220
Sure,

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:09.570
keep spinning your story.

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:12.220
You really think I would believe

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.420
that pack of nonsense?

00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:23.380
Suit yourself,

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:25.330
believe it or don't.

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:36.290
Kuminjia,

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.530
for a dignified princess to use such dirty tricks to catch me

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:40.980
is hardly an honorable win.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.530
You robbed my grain first.

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:44.140
If we're talking dirty tricks,

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:45.530
I can't hold a candle to you.

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:47.570
And now you're trying to goad me?

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:48.860
I'm not falling for it.

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:50.460
Fine by me,

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:51.900
saves me the trouble.

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:54.460
I've lived rough as a wandering thief.

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.770
Being kept here with good food

00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:58.050
isn't such a bad deal.

00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:01.660
Your Majesty, you really do know how to joke.

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:03.420
I told you, I'm not the Empress.

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:04.420
What,

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:05.940
does the great commander of Xijiang

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.900
really have to use the Empress to threaten Great Qi?

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:12.980
You've been besieging Jiangzhou City

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.900
for over a month already

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:16.180
and still haven't taken it.

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:19.580
No wonder you're turning to shady tricks.

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:22.060
Your Majesty,

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:23.780
provoking me like that

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:25.650
won't work at all.

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:28.900
I'm just stating the facts.

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.300
You stay calm even in danger,

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:37.650
truly impressive.

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:41.450
Ling Jueding just sent word:

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:43.010
in five days,

00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:45.900
Great Qi's envoys will come to make peace with me.

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:48.380
Who you really are

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.780
will be clear soon enough.

00:21:58.840 --> 00:21:59.620
All right then.

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:17.170
You really are quite something.

00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:19.250
What a pity.

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:21.540
A pity about what?

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:23.780
Pity you're a woman.

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:25.100
Otherwise,

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:28.010
I might have taken pity on your looks,

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:29.450
begged my brother to spare your life,

00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:30.780
and kept you for my own amusement.

00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:35.730
You should come to Great Qi instead.

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:37.970
Great Qi is vast and rich.

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.250
If there's one thing we never lack,

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:41.780
it's fine men everywhere.

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:43.780
You'd love it there.

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:46.300
Quit trying to fool me.

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:47.730
Just sit tight and behave!

00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:59.730
Everyone,

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:02.380
let's rest up while we can

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:04.100
and be ready to move at any time.

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:04.970
Yes, Sir!

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:16.340
Greetings, Madam.

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:18.860
May I ask why you summoned me,

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:19.820
Madam?

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.210
General Lu Qi,

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:24.860
at the Qingyu Guard's marching speed,

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:27.620
how long until we reach Jiangzhou?

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:29.410
Madam,

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:33.010
this time our escort is under a hundred riders,

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:34.690
mostly light cavalry.

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:36.780
If we push day and night,

00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:39.410
we can be in Jiangzhou in three days.

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.820
Then please pass the order:

00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:49.060
rest tomorrow

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:50.930
and depart the day after tomorrow at midmorning.

00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:53.250
Madam,

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:54.780
why is that?

00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:56.380
The enemy's momentum hits hardest the first time,

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:58.210
weaker the second,

00:23:58.600 --> 00:23:59.620
gone the third.

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:02.170
The more we rush,

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:05.010
the more we play right into Kumor's hands.

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.250
Let him wait.

00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:10.580
Wear down his edge.

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:15.250
He'll calm down and make peace with Great Qi.

00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:17.060
But...

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:18.860
I've heard one of our men

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:20.380
has been taken hostage by Kumor.

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:21.340
That man

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:22.580
is vital to us.

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:23.820
Precisely because of that,

00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:26.170
this is what we must do.

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:31.970
Trust me, General Lu.

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:36.380
His Majesty personally chose the Qingyu Guard

00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:37.540
to escort you.

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:41.010
We'll naturally follow your lead.

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:51.060
Ling Cangcang,

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:52.730
don't blame me for being ruthless.

00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:55.300
Everything I do is for Great Qi.

00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:59.170
Since Kumor is betting that you're the Empress of Great Qi,

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:01.210
if I arrive a few days late,

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:03.580
he still won't dare lay a finger on you.

00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:40.380
Your Highness.

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:12.340
Your Highness,

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:14.060
it's time for you

00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:15.650
to review the memorials now.

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:17.820
Aren't I reading them right now?

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:18.860
Why in such a hurry?

00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:19.930
Still, Your Highness,

00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:22.490
you're holding that memorial upside down.

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:31.170
What are you laughing at, Your Highness?

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:34.540
At how unlikeable my imperial brother's face is.

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:37.100
The ministers are all hoping he'll die soon.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:38.170
Your Highness,

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:40.450
you can't say such treasonous things

00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:42.210
so carelessly.

00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:43.010
Look at this one:

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:45.580
the prefect specially memorializes the throne,

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:48.210
saying it's been warm with little rain,

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:50.380
so this year's lychees will be a bumper crop

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:51.450
and delicious, too.

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:54.010
And this one:

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:56.340
"I am asking after Your Majesty's health."

00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:59.380
All these pointless memorials

00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:01.730
are enough to work my poor brother to death.

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:02.580
Your Highness,

00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:05.210
that's their way of showing loyalty.

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:07.820
Being emperor

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:10.100
really isn't a job for any normal person.

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:11.820
I see that now.

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:14.170
My imperial brother dumped the burden on me

00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:16.340
just to make me do all the hard labor for him.

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:17.900
Your Highness,

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:21.380
please watch your tongue!

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:23.010
All right,

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:24.650
drop the act.

00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:27.100
When my brother comes back,

00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:29.650
your old bones will be worn out from kneeling.

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:31.000
[Local locust control is already showing results.]

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:31.800
[No grain shortages or unrest are reported.]

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:32.900
[The Locust plague is expected to be resolved soon.]

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:37.340
Your Highness,

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:38.820
why are you laughing again?

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:41.010
The Governor of Xuzhou reports

00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:43.330
that the authorities acted in time,

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:44.780
the locust plague is no longer a real threat,

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:46.970
and the people are not short of grain.

00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:50.730
Looks like our Grand Tutor Ling

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:52.250
is quite efficient.

00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:54.340
All right.

00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:55.410
I'm tired.

00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:58.140
I'm going to the hot spring retreat to relax.

00:27:58.270 --> 00:27:59.780
Tell Li Hongqing:

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:01.970
If you want me to keep reviewing memorials,

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:03.620
he'll have to come invite me himself.

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:04.620
Your Highness,

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:05.970
oh...

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:08.380
Your Highness...

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:52.250
Carry on with your patrol.

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:54.210
Commander Li!

00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:55.690
Commander Li!

00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.210
Please wait, Commander Li.

00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:01.340
What can I do for you, Eunuch Feng?

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:02.250
Commander Li,

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:04.300
I'd like to ask you a favor.

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:06.730
- I'm not going to the cold palace again. - No...

00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:08.250
Commander Li,

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:09.010
this time,

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:10.860
it's not to see Princess Ying.

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:14.450
This time we need you to fetch Prince of Yuzhang.

00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:16.580
Prince of Yuzhang?

00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:17.620
Yes.

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:18.780
Prince of Yuzhang

00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:20.300
is off soaking in hot springs,

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:21.580
with a pile of memorials

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:24.140
still waiting for his review.

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:25.620
Then get someone to drag him back.

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:26.620
Why come to me?

00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:28.300
Commander Li,

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:30.410
who is Prince of Yuzhang?

00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:32.930
He's not someone just anyone can summon.

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:34.580
He already said

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:36.450
that if we want him back at the palace,

00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:39.210
Commander Li

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:41.060
must go in person.

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:42.970
Please, do a good deed today

00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:45.100
and save this old servant.

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:50.210
Those siblings really are troublesome.

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:52.210
Tell me about it.

00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:54.580
Commander Li, thank you for this!

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:23.930
Who...

00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:24.730
who's there?

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:30.490
You're here.

00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:32.340
In the middle of the night,

00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:34.210
you called me here just to watch you bathe?

00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:37.100
Naturally, I have serious business.

00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:40.490
Right now, for me,

00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:42.780
only Cangcang's whereabouts count as serious business.

00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:44.730
If it's not about her,

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:45.860
we're done talking.

00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:47.540
Zhong Lin,

00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:49.780
you're breaking our deal.

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:52.970
Your Highness, that's not fair!

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:55.300
I've been pretending to be Song Lanxi for so long.

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:56.580
I've done plenty for you!

00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:59.170
Now, on the surface, Cangcang is said to be at the retreat,

00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:00.100
but in truth,

00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:01.210
no one knows where she is!

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:02.970
There has to be more to it.

00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:04.820
Miss Zhong,

00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:07.340
help me one more time,

00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:08.250
and I promise...

00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:10.060
Your promises are worthless.

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:46.020
Your Highness.

00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:49.410
Down...

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:50.490
Get down!

00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:51.140
Down!

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:51.780
Quick!

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:02.650
Your Highness,

00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:05.300
I was sent by Eunuch Feng

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:06.380
to bring you back to the palace.

00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:08.860
What's the rush?

00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:10.170
Wait outside.

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:12.100
Once I've had my fill of soaking,

00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:13.250
I'll go out on my own.

00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:24.010
Then I'll stand right here

00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:25.060
until you do, Your Highness.

00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:25.970
Insolent!

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:27.580
How am I supposed to get out

00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:31.820
with you standing there?

00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:33.340
Just... turn around.

00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:34.820
Yes, Your Highness.

00:32:59.230 --> 00:33:00.140
Commander Li,

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:02.140
are you really going to stand there and watch?

00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:16.170
You...

00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:18.450
you actually slapped me in the face!

00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:19.650
And I meant every slap.

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:21.860
Shameless!

00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:26.190
- Miss Zhong. - Let go!

00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:27.450
- Miss Zhong. - Let go of me!

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:00.860
I'm leaving.

00:34:01.670 --> 00:34:02.580
Wait!

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:03.410
Miss...

00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:05.340
Miss Zhong...

00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:08.050
Vice Sect Leader Zhong...

00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:09.820
Sect Leader Zhong!

00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:12.900
I'm begging you.

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:16.010
Please go to Xuzhou in my place.

00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:16.660
Not going!

00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:20.010
The locust plague in Xuzhou

00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:21.490
is getting worse by the day.

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:23.490
Grand Tutor Ling and the Governor of Xuzhou

00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:25.740
have joined hands to hide the truth there.

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:28.490
They are forcing me to send grain to Jiangzhou.

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:32.660
What does that have to do with me?

00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:35.110
I came to the Capital to look for Cangcang.

00:34:35.150 --> 00:34:36.490
Now she's vanished without a trace.

00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:37.930
Why would I run off to Xuzhou?

00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:42.180
What's happening in Xuzhou

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:44.180
affects Ling Cangcang's safety.

00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:45.450
What do you mean?

00:34:46.630 --> 00:34:48.180
Fine, I'll be honest with you.

00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:51.090
Ling Cangcang is in Jiangzhou,

00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:53.050
and Xiao Huan has already gone after her.

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:54.740
So Ling Cangcang's safety

00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:57.010
isn't yours to worry about.

00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:58.860
But the disaster in Xuzhou

00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:00.660
is tied to Jiangzhou's crisis.

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:02.380
Only by easing Xuzhou's troubles

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:04.220
can we save Jiangzhou.

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:07.570
What kind of nonsense is that?

00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:09.820
Are you telling bedtime stories to kids now?

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:10.260
I...

00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:11.930
what do I gain by lying to you?

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:14.410
Who knows.

00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:16.490
Miss Zhong...

00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:17.780
Zhong Lin!

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:20.570
You really don't care about the people of Xuzhou?

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:22.700
Why did you found the Fenglai Pavilion?

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:25.700
All that talk about justice

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:26.930
and punishing evil,

00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:28.340
just empty talk?

00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:42.220
Say it.

00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:43.300
What do you want me to do?

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:46.180
Go to Xuzhou

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:48.340
and get a written confession from the Governor there.

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:01.340
It's a deal.

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:04.660
Wait!

00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:05.860
Now what?

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:08.050
Put this on.

00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:09.450
Do it quickly.

00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:11.050
My life and everything I have

00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:12.860
are in your hands now.

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:25.050
Your Highness,

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:28.930
will you return to the palace with me now?

00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:31.220
No rush.

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:33.860
Lately,

00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:35.930
I've had an annoying matter,

00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:37.610
and I'm in no mood at all.

00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:39.340
When I'm in a mood like this,

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:40.820
I simply can't review memorials.

00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:42.700
I wonder

00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:44.570
if you can help ease my mind.

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:46.130
Please speak.

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:50.340
I went to see Ying.

00:36:51.110 --> 00:36:53.090
She was heartbroken.

00:36:53.950 --> 00:36:55.410
After asking around,

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:56.700
I learned

00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:58.740
that it had something to do with you.

00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:03.660
What would you have me do?

00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:06.300
Ying may not be in her right mind

00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:07.610
and sometimes seems unhinged,

00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:09.700
but deep down

00:37:10.070 --> 00:37:12.010
she's kinder and more innocent

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:13.930
than anyone else in the harem.

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:16.410
So whatever happens,

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:19.340
I will always believe her without question.

00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:21.900
She would never harm the innocent.

00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:26.900
Then I misjudged the Princess.

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:32.860
Ying approaches feelings differently

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:34.610
from most people.

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:36.450
The purer she is,

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.780
the more easily she's hurt by those she cares about.

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:41.740
As her brother,

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:45.450
I don't want to see her in pain.

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:50.820
You started this.

00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:53.130
There's a way

00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:55.450
for you to make it up to her.

00:37:57.030 --> 00:37:58.010
Go find her

00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:01.130
and do whatever it takes to cheer her up.

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:05.410
If you succeed, I might just force myself to finish the memorials.

00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:08.220
What do you say?

00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:11.090
It was my fault

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:13.010
for misunderstanding the Princess.

00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:15.010
I should apologize.

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:20.380
When will you go?

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:23.220
I'll go right now.

00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:17.860
Li Hongqing!

00:39:24.110 --> 00:39:24.900
You're here.

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:27.570
Your Highness, I'm sorry.

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:29.010
I misunderstood you before.

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:32.660
This is for you.

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:35.660
Your Highness,

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:37.820
what do you mean by this?

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:42.010
Please give it to Guard Wang for me.

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:44.860
He may have lied to me first,

00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:47.530
but he was poisoned because of me.

00:39:47.550 --> 00:39:48.900
So, I ought to make it up to him.

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:53.450
This silver

00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:55.010
is from my brother.

00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:57.340
He didn't bring much that day.

00:39:58.030 --> 00:39:59.180
And this,

00:39:59.550 --> 00:40:00.340
also this...

00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:03.780
These are all my favorite things.

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:08.450
On Guard Wang's behalf,

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:10.130
thank you, Your Highness.

00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:12.050
Think nothing of it.

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:27.490
Then can you stop being mad at me from now on?

00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:30.860
If you want me to do something

00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:32.220
or not do something,

00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:34.010
you can just tell me directly.

00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:35.700
I'll listen to you.

00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:38.780
You don't have to listen to anyone.

00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:40.860
Just follow your own heart.

00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:46.220
There are rights and wrongs

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:48.570
I can't always tell apart.

00:40:51.110 --> 00:40:52.450
But I trust you.

00:40:53.110 --> 00:40:54.490
You'll know the difference.

00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:55.930
Your Highness,

00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:58.220
why do you trust me so much?

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:06.260
You think I don't remember?

00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:09.130
Back when the Crown Prince's Hall caught fire,

00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:10.660
you saved me.

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:12.340
You used this arm

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:14.610
to shield me from a falling burning beam.

00:41:16.070 --> 00:41:18.410
I thought Your Highness had long forgotten.

00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:19.820
Of course I remember!

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:21.780
Before that imperial physician took me away,

00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:23.220
I bit you hard on the arm,

00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:25.860
so I could find you again one day.

00:41:30.070 --> 00:41:31.180
Then

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:32.570
when did you realize

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:34.220
I was the guard who saved you?

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:39.570
I'm not telling you.

00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:42.410
But since I've found you,

00:41:42.430 --> 00:41:44.090
I'll definitely treat you well.

00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:47.010
It's simply our duty as the Imperial Guard.

00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:48.700
Don't trouble yourself over it.

00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:50.820
I don't care.

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:53.220
If I say I'll treat you well,

00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:55.820
then I'll treat you well.

00:42:08.850 --> 00:42:11.780
Since the disaster in Xuzhou is under control,

00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:13.620
I ask Your Highness

00:42:14.370 --> 00:42:16.660
to release the grain for Jiangzhou as soon as possible.

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:19.490
Once the Ministry of Revenue finishes counting the grain

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:21.340
and I've checked it,

00:42:22.070 --> 00:42:23.180
I'll naturally issue it.

00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:24.570
The war is pressing.

00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:26.570
We must not deliberately delay.

00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:28.900
I hope Your Highness will give the order today.

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:33.380
Deliberately?

00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:35.090
That's quite the crime

00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:36.380
you're pinning on me.

00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:38.220
Why don't you go ask His Majesty himself

00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:39.780
how he plans to punish me?

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:40.780
Your Highness...

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:46.460
Then may I ask,

00:42:47.110 --> 00:42:48.690
how many more days do you expect

00:42:49.230 --> 00:42:50.690
this grain counting to take?

00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:53.060
Seven or eight days at least.

00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:54.940
Rest easy, Grand Tutor Ling.

00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:56.690
When Preceptor Du left the Capital,

00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:58.250
she took plenty of grain with her.

00:42:58.750 --> 00:43:00.900
That will ease Jiangzhou's immediate crisis.

00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:03.090
That only buys us time!

00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:04.540
I sincerely beg Your Highness

00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:06.820
to release the second batch as soon as possible.

00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:10.940
Jiangzhou is a key fortress,
