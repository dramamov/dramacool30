00:01:14.455 --> 00:01:15.975
small red dates small red dates

00:01:16.532 --> 00:01:17.871
Have you seen the little red dates?

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.610
Have you seen the little red dates?

00:01:19.635 --> 00:01:21.021
What happened? What happened?

00:01:21.046 --> 00:01:22.206
Have you seen the red dates?

00:01:23.594 --> 00:01:24.540
No red dates

00:01:25.267 --> 00:01:26.158
what happened

00:01:26.305 --> 00:01:27.474
I took her to buy meat buns

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:28.527
After paying, turn around

00:01:28.552 --> 00:01:29.661
She disappeared

00:01:29.686 --> 00:01:30.377
Too bad

00:01:30.982 --> 00:01:32.252
She couldn't have been abducted, right?

00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:33.843
This...hey

00:01:34.408 --> 00:01:35.105
Jingyuan

00:01:40.381 --> 00:01:41.386
This little guy

00:01:41.411 --> 00:01:43.130
He's a good money maker

00:01:44.551 --> 00:01:45.761
I broke her legs

00:01:45.858 --> 00:01:46.938
You blinded her eyes

00:01:47.014 --> 00:01:47.629
Be quick

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:48.701
Um

00:01:52.846 --> 00:01:53.515
who

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.333
Doctor of Shenxing Division

00:02:05.462 --> 00:02:06.321
Jingyuan

00:02:07.153 --> 00:02:08.110
doctor

00:02:08.446 --> 00:02:09.861
You don’t go to the doctor and get medicine

00:02:09.886 --> 00:02:10.886
What are you doing here?

00:02:11.132 --> 00:02:12.412
Mind your own business

00:02:12.884 --> 00:02:13.661
Get out of here

00:02:15.795 --> 00:02:18.152
I heard that there is a kind of flower girl among the people.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.211
Specially maiming children for begging

00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:23.624
If you really want to make this money

00:02:23.883 --> 00:02:25.643
Why not cripple yourself

00:02:27.157 --> 00:02:28.868
If you can't do it

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:31.127
let me help you

00:02:32.138 --> 00:02:33.533
Kill him together

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:01.260
Found it found it

00:03:01.285 --> 00:03:02.249
Little red dates were found

00:03:04.336 --> 00:03:05.496
elder sister

00:03:06.547 --> 00:03:08.755
Little Hongzao, why are you like this?

00:03:09.104 --> 00:03:10.077
Not hurt?

00:03:11.041 --> 00:03:12.002
Promise sister next time

00:03:12.027 --> 00:03:13.146
Stop running around

00:03:13.411 --> 00:03:14.490
Worried to death

00:03:14.515 --> 00:03:15.365
small red dates

00:03:16.711 --> 00:03:17.704
father

00:03:17.911 --> 00:03:18.893
You debt collector

00:03:18.918 --> 00:03:20.074
Scared dad to death

00:03:20.261 --> 00:03:21.543
If the benefactor hadn't been there

00:03:21.568 --> 00:03:22.049
gentlemen

00:03:22.547 --> 00:03:24.152
He was abducted by Paihuazi just now

00:03:25.051 --> 00:03:26.058
As long as the child is fine

00:03:26.348 --> 00:03:28.187
But you, a businessman, are taking such a young child out with you?

00:03:28.212 --> 00:03:29.196
Must be more careful

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:30.417
small red dates

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:32.208
Kneel down and kowtow to your benefactor

00:03:32.665 --> 00:03:33.665
There is no need to perform such a big gift

00:03:33.905 --> 00:03:34.670
A little effort

00:03:35.581 --> 00:03:37.408
It's you who were kind to us first

00:03:37.491 --> 00:03:38.380
You're welcome

00:03:39.398 --> 00:03:40.483
It'll be good if the child comes back

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:41.660
It's okay

00:03:42.004 --> 00:03:42.655
Um

00:03:56.425 --> 00:03:58.025
Who told me yesterday

00:03:59.296 --> 00:04:00.880
This world is false

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.043
Everyone's destiny is determined

00:04:06.044 --> 00:04:06.727
Then why are you

00:04:06.752 --> 00:04:08.546
So anxious to save Xiaohongzao

00:04:10.023 --> 00:04:10.858
this kind of thing

00:04:11.465 --> 00:04:12.415
How can you not be in a hurry?

00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:15.933
Besides, I showed up there

00:04:16.373 --> 00:04:17.853
Maybe it's God's arrangement

00:04:17.878 --> 00:04:18.878
Let me save her

00:04:20.352 --> 00:04:21.152
careful

00:04:29.818 --> 00:04:31.383
Maybe I enter the storybook

00:04:32.022 --> 00:04:33.222
come to you

00:04:35.017 --> 00:04:36.386
It's also fate's arrangement

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.671
every year

00:04:44.352 --> 00:04:45.543
What do you want to say

00:04:48.462 --> 00:04:50.611
I would say instead of feeling sorry for yourself

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.561
Better to accept it calmly

00:04:55.679 --> 00:04:57.393
What is this fate?

00:05:00.246 --> 00:05:01.847
Why don't we take a walk together?

00:05:10.181 --> 00:05:10.918
you forgot

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:13.610
what is my fate

00:05:15.094 --> 00:05:16.243
It's all arranged by you

00:05:39.447 --> 00:05:40.183
every year

00:05:43.381 --> 00:05:44.915
I just want to confirm one thing

00:05:46.394 --> 00:05:47.677
Your relationship with me

00:05:49.603 --> 00:05:51.577
The friendship you made me feel

00:05:53.788 --> 00:05:55.069
Are these things true?

00:05:57.875 --> 00:05:59.555
It really exists in my heart

00:06:01.498 --> 00:06:02.857
Or is it fate?

00:06:05.496 --> 00:06:07.199
Or is it just my wishful thinking?

00:06:51.105 --> 00:06:52.345
Finally found it

00:06:52.952 --> 00:06:54.193
This should be Ziwei’s house

00:06:54.218 --> 00:06:54.649
Um

00:06:57.968 --> 00:06:58.874
Is anyone there?

00:07:02.217 --> 00:07:03.152
golden lock

00:07:10.392 --> 00:07:11.255
It seems here

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.874
It must have been uninhabited for a long time

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:16.043
This golden lock

00:07:16.068 --> 00:07:17.499
She is not in the capital

00:07:17.524 --> 00:07:18.844
Not in my hometown in Jinan

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:20.900
So where can she go?

00:07:22.516 --> 00:07:23.805
When I just entered the city

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:24.943
I paid careful attention

00:07:25.312 --> 00:07:26.031
Jinan City

00:07:26.056 --> 00:07:26.977
Not posted yet

00:07:27.002 --> 00:07:28.520
Wanted poster for Ziwei and Xiaoyanzi

00:07:28.716 --> 00:07:29.680
That is to say

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:31.599
Things in the capital haven't reached here yet

00:07:31.666 --> 00:07:32.666
we still have a chance

00:07:32.871 --> 00:07:33.371
Um

00:07:33.625 --> 00:07:35.949
Anyway, Jinsuo and Ziwei grew up here.

00:07:36.626 --> 00:07:37.868
It'll be dawn in a while

00:07:37.893 --> 00:07:39.280
Let's go ask around

00:07:39.471 --> 00:07:41.136
There must be someone here who knows Jinsuo

00:07:41.256 --> 00:07:43.277
We will definitely get the news about Jinsuo

00:07:43.527 --> 00:07:44.136
good

00:07:45.106 --> 00:07:45.883
Ziwei

00:07:45.908 --> 00:07:46.674
I remember

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:48.340
There is this maid who is always following her

00:07:48.365 --> 00:07:49.021
Um

00:07:49.599 --> 00:07:50.624
Then...then what?

00:07:51.318 --> 00:07:52.299
crape myrtle

00:07:52.324 --> 00:07:53.302
What

00:07:53.849 --> 00:07:55.250
golden lock

00:07:55.403 --> 00:07:56.403
What

00:07:56.529 --> 00:07:57.743
golden lock

00:07:57.768 --> 00:07:59.271
door unlocked

00:07:59.296 --> 00:08:01.930
No matter what you say, I can’t hear you

00:08:02.459 --> 00:08:05.071
I'm talking about the maid

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:06.290
gold

00:08:06.337 --> 00:08:07.158
Lock

00:08:07.911 --> 00:08:09.386
It turns out her name is Jinsuo

00:08:09.411 --> 00:08:10.080
Right, right, right

00:08:10.105 --> 00:08:10.828
Do you remember

00:08:10.983 --> 00:08:12.599
Oh, I don’t know

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:18.250
I don't know you "Oh" what?

00:08:18.466 --> 00:08:19.280
laugh

00:08:25.688 --> 00:08:26.946
I guess this Xia Yuhe

00:08:26.971 --> 00:08:28.611
Didn't wait for the emperor's reply

00:08:29.349 --> 00:08:30.689
Only in this small place

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:31.969
Living with my tail between my legs

00:08:33.446 --> 00:08:34.446
What do you think?

00:08:34.893 --> 00:08:35.990
Even her uncle and aunt

00:08:36.015 --> 00:08:37.193
Don't even want to talk to her

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:38.918
Not to mention other people

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.754
I want to find the golden lock

00:08:44.808 --> 00:08:45.543
Disaster

00:08:47.416 --> 00:08:47.986
Lin'er

00:08:48.745 --> 00:08:49.745
i found

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.383
Your judgment on certain things

00:08:52.408 --> 00:08:53.488
beyond my imagination

00:08:53.865 --> 00:08:55.105
Women of your world

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:56.524
Are they all as smart as you?

00:08:57.671 --> 00:08:58.549
Don't forget

00:08:59.379 --> 00:09:02.060
There is a gap of more than two hundred years between us.

00:09:02.909 --> 00:09:04.908
Humanity is constantly making progress

00:09:04.933 --> 00:09:05.933
That is to say

00:09:06.438 --> 00:09:07.077
Lin'er

00:09:07.226 --> 00:09:09.263
She is the smartest woman in my world

00:09:09.288 --> 00:09:09.761
Is it right

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:14.690
Oh yo yo yo

00:09:15.591 --> 00:09:18.755
This is the first time Master Jing has praised slave.

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:19.993
not easy

00:09:20.358 --> 00:09:21.427
not easy

00:09:21.452 --> 00:09:23.527
If you behaved so well every day

00:09:23.745 --> 00:09:25.618
I praise you like this every day

00:09:26.389 --> 00:09:28.027
If I were really that smart

00:09:28.052 --> 00:09:29.821
I have found this golden lock a long time ago

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:31.021
It doesn't matter

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:33.405
It’s not like we didn’t gain anything today.

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:34.533
Although we didn't find her

00:09:34.558 --> 00:09:36.278
But we know for sure that this person exists

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.480
And it’s confirmed

00:09:38.511 --> 00:09:41.130
She grew up with Ziwei

00:10:14.429 --> 00:10:15.089
ah

00:10:15.481 --> 00:10:16.881
Only one room left

00:10:17.813 --> 00:10:19.449
Didn’t you just say

00:10:19.672 --> 00:10:20.911
You two as a couple

00:10:20.936 --> 00:10:22.377
Are you coming to Jinan City to find relatives?

00:10:22.726 --> 00:10:24.008
Since they are a couple

00:10:24.094 --> 00:10:25.133
One room is enough

00:10:25.499 --> 00:10:26.499
Is there any problem?

00:10:29.274 --> 00:10:29.940
right

00:10:30.752 --> 00:10:31.752
no problem

00:10:32.114 --> 00:10:32.930
Xianggong

00:10:33.361 --> 00:10:34.680
We are tired of traveling

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:36.749
It’s time to rest early

00:10:37.296 --> 00:10:38.071
Lead the way

00:10:38.096 --> 00:10:39.608
The waiter will send you two upstairs

00:10:39.869 --> 00:10:40.533
OK

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:41.596
guest officer

00:10:41.621 --> 00:10:42.371
Please upstairs

00:10:47.672 --> 00:10:48.455
tonight

00:10:50.154 --> 00:10:51.068
how to sleep

00:10:51.364 --> 00:10:52.068
Easy to handle

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:54.846
I sleep underground

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:56.465
You sleep on the bed

00:10:57.038 --> 00:10:58.038
Us

00:10:59.114 --> 00:11:00.474
Well water does not offend river water

00:11:01.547 --> 00:11:03.199
What if the well water wants to invade the river water?

00:11:10.563 --> 00:11:11.536
There's someone at the door

00:11:14.028 --> 00:11:15.239
It's over, it's over, it's over

00:11:15.477 --> 00:11:16.715
Is it the innkeeper?

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:17.483
discover our

00:11:18.124 --> 00:11:18.861
Identity

00:11:18.886 --> 00:11:19.605
possible

00:11:21.383 --> 00:11:22.618
Sit down quickly

00:11:22.965 --> 00:11:24.540
Then what else can we do?

00:11:24.565 --> 00:11:25.946
Looking for a golden lock

00:11:27.095 --> 00:11:28.455
So we only have

00:11:28.955 --> 00:11:30.402
Acting for real

00:11:30.644 --> 00:11:33.199
Let him believe that we are a real couple

00:11:34.082 --> 00:11:35.274
fake show

00:11:35.884 --> 00:11:37.065
Really do it

00:12:30.709 --> 00:12:31.965
Are you leaving?

00:12:33.899 --> 00:12:34.726
Gone

00:12:38.243 --> 00:12:39.390
let me tell you a secret

00:12:39.926 --> 00:12:40.674
Um

00:12:42.145 --> 00:12:43.464
I just lied to you

00:12:48.157 --> 00:12:49.797
Good on you, a doctor from the Department of Punishment

00:12:50.549 --> 00:12:51.586
You also learn now

00:12:51.611 --> 00:12:53.108
You're lying, right?

00:12:53.622 --> 00:12:54.662
Department of Precautionary Punishment

00:12:55.714 --> 00:12:57.368
These are not the only ways to induce confessions.

00:12:58.154 --> 00:12:59.195
It's easy to deceive people

00:13:01.354 --> 00:13:03.327
I thought of a way

00:13:03.956 --> 00:13:05.795
Can find golden lock

00:13:06.943 --> 00:13:07.830
What can be done

00:13:08.918 --> 00:13:12.717
wait and see

00:13:21.016 --> 00:13:23.186
This is the busiest street in Jinan City

00:13:23.506 --> 00:13:25.571
We'll use one hundred taels of silver to find Ziwei

00:13:25.687 --> 00:13:27.127
As long as Jinsuo is in Jinan

00:13:27.152 --> 00:13:28.143
She heard the news

00:13:28.168 --> 00:13:29.405
She will definitely come to us

00:13:29.699 --> 00:13:31.300
What a waiter

00:13:31.475 --> 00:13:32.718
But if someone comes

00:13:32.743 --> 00:13:33.646
It's not a golden lock

00:13:34.821 --> 00:13:36.986
Even if the person coming is not Jinsuo

00:13:37.248 --> 00:13:39.630
That must be someone who is very familiar with Ziwei.

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:41.761
As long as he is familiar with Ziwei

00:13:42.047 --> 00:13:44.130
Then you must know the clues to the golden lock

00:13:45.749 --> 00:13:47.646
Just prepare one hundred taels of silver.

00:13:54.962 --> 00:13:56.041
One hundred taels

00:13:57.707 --> 00:13:59.327
Xia Ziwei

00:14:00.636 --> 00:14:02.215
This one hundred taels will definitely not be a loss

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.599
Who is Xia Ziwei?

00:14:03.624 --> 00:14:04.743
No matter who she is

00:14:04.768 --> 00:14:06.315
But one hundred taels

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:07.118
One hundred taels

00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:08.618
I'll go home and ask

00:14:08.643 --> 00:14:09.843
Who knows this Xia Ziwei?

00:14:14.589 --> 00:14:15.571
Xia Ziwei

00:14:15.596 --> 00:14:17.835
Miss Xia by the Daming Lake

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:18.836
I know him

00:14:22.379 --> 00:14:23.221
old man

00:14:23.246 --> 00:14:24.136
Do you know her?

00:14:25.194 --> 00:14:25.883
Um

00:14:26.778 --> 00:14:27.877
Then you remember

00:14:28.016 --> 00:14:29.940
She has a personal maid

00:14:29.965 --> 00:14:31.045
Is it called Jinsuo?

00:14:31.291 --> 00:14:32.602
Golden lock?

00:14:33.228 --> 00:14:35.029
Aren’t you the golden lock?

00:14:35.622 --> 00:14:38.093
I used to treat Miss Xia

00:14:38.188 --> 00:14:41.077
You pay first and then get the medicine
