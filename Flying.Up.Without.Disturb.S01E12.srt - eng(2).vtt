(Fengyi)

00:01:46.398 --> 00:01:47.398
Huan Zong, look!

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:50.719
Why does she have so much energy?

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:51.638
Never feel tired.

00:01:53.118 --> 00:01:53.918
Young Master.

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:56.159
What was that phoenix symbol

00:01:56.278 --> 00:01:57.159
emerged when Kong Hou

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:58.118
underwent tribulation?

00:02:00.998 --> 00:02:01.918
Probably some charm

00:02:01.918 --> 00:02:02.879
her master set up

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:04.558
to shield her from thunder strikes.

00:02:04.758 --> 00:02:05.959
Thunder strikes?

00:02:06.198 --> 00:02:07.519
It was really powerful.

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:09.279
My whole back still hurts
from getting hit.

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:10.638
To block dark cultivators

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:12.439
and even us now.

00:02:12.638 --> 00:02:14.078
So ungrateful!

00:02:14.758 --> 00:02:16.958
Huan Zong, Lin Hu, hurry up!

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:17.758
Let's go.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.836
(Haoqing Temple)

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:25.758
This is our Liuguang Sect's

00:02:25.758 --> 00:02:26.999
branch in Fengyi.

00:02:27.238 --> 00:02:28.719
The message about Cloudseeker Twig

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:30.198
came from them.

00:02:30.798 --> 00:02:31.319
Elder.

00:02:34.518 --> 00:02:35.758
Greetings, Elder.

00:02:35.918 --> 00:02:37.238
Greetings, Senior Lin Hu.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.198
This must be

00:02:38.198 --> 00:02:38.839
the new prodigy

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:39.839
Elder recently took in.

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:41.478
How could I possibly be

00:02:41.478 --> 00:02:42.719
Huan Zong's disciple?

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:45.039
We're good friends!

00:02:45.238 --> 00:02:46.478
- Friends?
- Greetings, Elder Kong Hou.

00:02:46.918 --> 00:02:48.478
I'm an Elder too!

00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:51.518
Come on.

00:02:52.478 --> 00:02:53.599
Take these.

00:02:54.758 --> 00:02:56.119
Thank you, Elder Kong Hou.

00:02:56.719 --> 00:02:58.198
Keep working hard.

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:02.879
Huan Zong, let's go!

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:08.518
Do you know the exact location?

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.518
A beggar

00:03:09.518 --> 00:03:10.599
said that Cloudseeker Twig

00:03:10.758 --> 00:03:11.918
is in Fengyi.

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:13.039
But he didn't specify

00:03:13.279 --> 00:03:14.078
where it is.

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:16.358
You believed a beggar's words?

00:03:16.478 --> 00:03:17.599
He's no ordinary beggar.

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:19.358
He's famous among rogue cultivators.

00:03:19.478 --> 00:03:20.599
Hating

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:21.358
constraints,

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:23.319
he wanders around the streets

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:24.238
with beggars,

00:03:24.478 --> 00:03:26.159
calling himself "Old Beggar".

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:27.439
If you call him by his name,

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:28.279
he gets mad.

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:29.358
Where is he now?

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:31.678
Haven't seen him

00:03:31.798 --> 00:03:32.879
since that one meeting.

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:35.678
Did you infiltrate the beggar groups

00:03:35.678 --> 00:03:36.559
to gather information?

00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:37.478
Lady Kong Hou.

00:03:38.976 --> 00:03:39.904
No, Elder Kong Hou.

00:03:40.198 --> 00:03:41.159
You might not know.

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:43.039
Beggars in Fengyi are complicated.

00:03:43.198 --> 00:03:44.559
Though an official sect,

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:45.758
they are very united.

00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.399
It split into East

00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:48.119
and West factions.

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:49.518
We orthodox sects

00:03:49.758 --> 00:03:50.518
can't infiltrate

00:03:50.518 --> 00:03:51.559
either group.

00:03:54.518 --> 00:03:55.439
- Here.
- Thank you.

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:56.839
Do you know anything

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:58.198
about the Cloudseeker Twig?

00:03:58.399 --> 00:03:59.238
No.

00:04:02.518 --> 00:04:03.039
That's okay.

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:04.238
What are you doing?

00:04:04.678 --> 00:04:05.478
Just some questions.

00:04:09.198 --> 00:04:09.999
Stop running!

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:11.439
Just a few questions!

00:04:11.798 --> 00:04:12.439
Go away!

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:14.119
- Get out!
- Hurry!

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.879
- Go!
- Go!

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:19.358
Young Master.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.438
I've talked to several.

00:04:21.438 --> 00:04:22.399
Either they didn't know

00:04:22.478 --> 00:04:23.678
or they ran immediately.

00:04:23.878 --> 00:04:24.079
Could

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:25.599
the information be mistaken?

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:28.238
Liuguang Sect disciples

00:04:28.238 --> 00:04:29.519
always act prudently.

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:30.199
It couldn't.

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:31.678
Stop!

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:32.719
I earned the chicken leg

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:33.599
fair and square!

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:34.639
I won't give it!

00:04:34.878 --> 00:04:36.478
This is West Faction territory.

00:04:36.478 --> 00:04:37.998
You crossed borders!

00:04:38.079 --> 00:04:40.039
- Catch him!
- Stop!

00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:41.079
Stop!

00:04:42.519 --> 00:04:43.118
Senior...

00:04:43.118 --> 00:04:43.839
Stop it.

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:53.678
- You little brat!
- After him!

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:54.599
Get him!

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:46.998
Kong Hou's storage pouch?

00:05:48.998 --> 00:05:49.918
How could she leave

00:05:49.918 --> 00:05:50.839
something so important?

00:06:04.519 --> 00:06:05.399
Senior!

00:06:06.079 --> 00:06:06.839
It's been months.

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:07.998
I missed you so much!

00:06:09.918 --> 00:06:10.478
Senior.

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:12.918
I brought you delicious roast chicken.

00:06:14.238 --> 00:06:15.199
Roast chicken?

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:17.079
You're so sweet.

00:06:17.238 --> 00:06:18.399
Grateful girl.

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:19.238
Try it.

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:21.839
Is it good?

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:22.839
I haven't eaten

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:24.118
such good roast chicken in ages.

00:06:24.839 --> 00:06:26.798
Slow down, Senior.

00:06:26.959 --> 00:06:28.159
Don't rush.

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:29.998
Let me wipe your mouth.

00:06:31.238 --> 00:06:33.438
You're getting it everywhere.

00:06:34.878 --> 00:06:35.456
Who's there?

00:06:40.519 --> 00:06:42.358
Huan Zong? Why are you here?

00:06:42.519 --> 00:06:44.039
I was about to ask you.

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:45.399
It's midnight.

00:06:45.399 --> 00:06:46.199
What are you doing?

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:47.159
Meeting

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:47.998
a beggar in secret?

00:06:48.519 --> 00:06:49.678
Who are you calling a beggar?

00:06:50.079 --> 00:06:51.159
I'm her Senior!

00:06:52.798 --> 00:06:54.438
So you're that Young Master?

00:06:54.719 --> 00:06:55.998
I knew you were suspicious.

00:06:56.159 --> 00:06:57.519
Are you eyeing Kong Hou?

00:06:58.318 --> 00:06:59.199
No!

00:06:59.279 --> 00:07:00.719
Senior, it's not what you think.

00:07:01.798 --> 00:07:02.599
Let me explain

00:07:02.599 --> 00:07:04.159
when we get back.

00:07:05.438 --> 00:07:06.199
Senior.

00:07:06.519 --> 00:07:07.358
I'll find you a place

00:07:07.438 --> 00:07:08.798
to clean up properly.

00:07:09.118 --> 00:07:10.039
Here's my room.

00:07:12.039 --> 00:07:13.599
Alright, we're here.

00:07:13.918 --> 00:07:14.558
You can go now.

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:15.998
We have matters to discuss.

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:18.759
I also have matters with her.

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:19.678
You...

00:07:19.798 --> 00:07:20.478
Senior.

00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:22.358
Just let him in.

00:07:22.438 --> 00:07:22.878
Besides,

00:07:22.959 --> 00:07:24.438
we're on Liuguang Sect's territory.

00:07:28.399 --> 00:07:29.039
Alright.

00:07:29.039 --> 00:07:29.959
Come with me.

00:07:30.719 --> 00:07:31.199
Let's go.

00:07:34.918 --> 00:07:36.918
I found it in your front room.
Keep it safe.

00:07:38.159 --> 00:07:39.678
So you picked it up.

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:40.639
No wonder

00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:41.798
I couldn't find it anywhere.

00:07:41.959 --> 00:07:42.959
Be careful.

00:07:43.039 --> 00:07:43.872
Don't lose it again.

00:07:44.918 --> 00:07:45.878
Understood.

00:07:46.079 --> 00:07:46.678
Today

00:07:46.798 --> 00:07:48.599
I was too careless.

00:07:48.839 --> 00:07:50.079
Thank you, Huan Zong.

00:07:52.358 --> 00:07:53.318
What did you say?

00:07:53.558 --> 00:07:54.438
You're an outsider.

00:07:54.438 --> 00:07:55.079
Don't lecture

00:07:55.079 --> 00:07:55.998
my junior!

00:07:57.399 --> 00:07:58.159
And you.

00:07:58.358 --> 00:07:59.358
A young girl

00:07:59.558 --> 00:08:00.238
being so close

00:08:00.238 --> 00:08:00.959
with a stranger?

00:08:01.079 --> 00:08:01.678
Improper.

00:08:01.839 --> 00:08:02.839
Senior.

00:08:03.118 --> 00:08:05.318
Huan Zong isn't a stranger.

00:08:05.519 --> 00:08:06.878
He's one of us.

00:08:08.079 --> 00:08:08.639
Huan Zong,

00:08:09.519 --> 00:08:10.678
this is Tan Feng,

00:08:10.839 --> 00:08:11.719
my Senior.

00:08:13.118 --> 00:08:13.918
Hi, Senior Tan Feng.

00:08:13.998 --> 00:08:14.959
I'm not your senior.

00:08:16.519 --> 00:08:17.478
Senior,

00:08:17.639 --> 00:08:19.238
Huan Zong means no harm.

00:08:19.399 --> 00:08:20.448
You're too naive.

00:08:20.576 --> 00:08:22.528
You don't realize
what intentions he harbors.

00:08:22.528 --> 00:08:24.928
He starts sending you message talismans
before you left.

00:08:24.928 --> 00:08:25.678
He clearly knew...

00:08:27.558 --> 00:08:29.318
So you're saying

00:08:29.399 --> 00:08:31.639
my messenger talismans from Huan Zong

00:08:31.798 --> 00:08:34.759
were hidden by you?

00:08:35.519 --> 00:08:35.718
No.

00:08:36.879 --> 00:08:37.239
No.

00:08:37.999 --> 00:08:38.558
It wasn't me.

00:08:38.999 --> 00:08:39.718
It was Master.

00:08:39.759 --> 00:08:40.999
He feared you'd be deceived

00:08:40.999 --> 00:08:42.198
so he hid the talismans.

00:08:42.239 --> 00:08:43.438
But this guy didn't give up,

00:08:43.558 --> 00:08:44.359
even sent people.

00:08:44.479 --> 00:08:45.078
Master and I

00:08:45.078 --> 00:08:46.438
barely drove him off.

00:08:46.598 --> 00:08:47.999
And now he's stuck to you

00:08:47.999 --> 00:08:48.718
like glue!

00:08:50.918 --> 00:08:51.639
Huan Zong.

00:08:51.838 --> 00:08:53.039
You even sent someone

00:08:53.279 --> 00:08:55.239
down the mountain to find me?

00:08:55.718 --> 00:08:56.438
Yes.

00:08:58.399 --> 00:08:59.999
Huan Zong, you're so nice.

00:09:01.279 --> 00:09:02.479
Kong Hou.

00:09:02.558 --> 00:09:03.639
Don't be fooled by him!

00:09:03.838 --> 00:09:05.119
Senior.

00:09:05.279 --> 00:09:06.198
Do you know

00:09:06.359 --> 00:09:08.159
if Huan Zong hadn't protected me

00:09:08.159 --> 00:09:09.239
all this way,

00:09:09.438 --> 00:09:11.718
you wouldn't even see me now.

00:09:12.279 --> 00:09:12.999
Senior.

00:09:13.759 --> 00:09:14.718
Senior.

00:09:15.318 --> 00:09:16.198
If you keep this up,

00:09:16.598 --> 00:09:17.598
I won't talk to you.

00:09:18.879 --> 00:09:19.798
It's for your own good.

00:09:22.918 --> 00:09:24.239
I understand.

00:09:24.798 --> 00:09:26.039
By the way,

00:09:26.119 --> 00:09:27.399
why are you here?

00:09:29.798 --> 00:09:30.558
Speaking of this,

00:09:30.598 --> 00:09:31.279
it's because

00:09:31.318 --> 00:09:32.558
of the message you sent back.

00:09:33.039 --> 00:09:34.639
We suspect that Yuanji Sect is connected

00:09:34.639 --> 00:09:35.479
to those exploding

00:09:35.479 --> 00:09:36.838
grey-robed cultivators

00:09:36.838 --> 00:09:37.558
in Qiu City.

00:09:37.639 --> 00:09:38.119
So the sect

00:09:38.119 --> 00:09:39.399
sent people to investigate.

00:09:40.479 --> 00:09:41.759
Masters.

00:09:42.279 --> 00:09:43.119
By investigation,

00:09:43.759 --> 00:09:44.239
I discovered

00:09:44.239 --> 00:09:45.039
that the cultivator

00:09:45.039 --> 00:09:46.399
was originally a beggar in Fengyi.

00:09:46.558 --> 00:09:47.359
He was fed

00:09:47.359 --> 00:09:48.239
by dark cultivators

00:09:48.239 --> 00:09:49.318
to reach Nascent Soul

00:09:49.519 --> 00:09:50.519
and sent to cause chaos.

00:09:51.399 --> 00:09:52.318
If that's the case,

00:09:52.558 --> 00:09:53.958
you'll have

00:09:54.159 --> 00:09:55.318
to go to Fengyi

00:09:55.318 --> 00:09:57.359
and investigate further.

00:09:57.598 --> 00:09:59.438
I won't fail.

00:09:59.678 --> 00:10:00.399
Wait.

00:10:01.359 --> 00:10:02.239
Those beggars

00:10:02.279 --> 00:10:04.159
stick together

00:10:04.359 --> 00:10:05.798
and distrust outsiders.

00:10:05.999 --> 00:10:07.039
To investigate,

00:10:08.759 --> 00:10:10.598
you'll need to join their ranks.

00:10:12.438 --> 00:10:13.239
Wait.

00:10:13.479 --> 00:10:14.198
If the sect

00:10:14.198 --> 00:10:16.239
assigned Senior Wu Chuan,

00:10:16.598 --> 00:10:18.119
why are you here instead?

00:10:20.598 --> 00:10:21.479
Look at Wu Chuan.

00:10:21.479 --> 00:10:23.039
With his dignified bearing,

00:10:23.198 --> 00:10:24.239
he looks nothing

00:10:24.318 --> 00:10:26.598
like a beggar.

00:10:26.759 --> 00:10:27.359
Exactly.

00:10:27.359 --> 00:10:28.078
Nothing like.

00:10:28.119 --> 00:10:28.718
Absolutely.

00:10:28.879 --> 00:10:29.718
If he goes begging,

00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:30.838
he'll starve to death.

00:10:32.639 --> 00:10:35.039
We need someone convincing.

00:10:35.359 --> 00:10:37.598
Yes. Find someone who looks the part.

00:10:47.999 --> 00:10:48.999
Me?

00:10:49.359 --> 00:10:50.958
Masters

00:10:50.999 --> 00:10:51.678
really have

00:10:51.678 --> 00:10:53.479
sharp eyes.

00:10:53.759 --> 00:10:55.759
Who else but you could play a beggar?

00:10:55.918 --> 00:10:56.678
I'm telling you.

00:10:56.678 --> 00:10:57.318
When I saw you

00:10:57.318 --> 00:10:58.678
in this disguise,

00:10:58.678 --> 00:10:59.879
I almost thought you'd

00:10:59.879 --> 00:11:00.838
really become a beggar.

00:11:02.039 --> 00:11:03.359
This is called scouting,

00:11:03.519 --> 00:11:04.279
okay?

00:11:04.918 --> 00:11:06.039
You little brat.

00:11:06.039 --> 00:11:07.519
Dare mock me after just days apart?

00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.359
- Senior! Never again.
- Stop there.

00:11:09.759 --> 00:11:10.119
Stop!

00:11:10.119 --> 00:11:10.759
Senior. Don't!

00:11:10.879 --> 00:11:11.279
Stop!

00:11:11.279 --> 00:11:12.279
Huan Zong! Help!

00:11:12.798 --> 00:11:13.279
Stop there.

00:11:13.359 --> 00:11:13.918
Huan Zong!

00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:14.678
Senior Tan Feng.

00:11:16.239 --> 00:11:17.639
We still have our mission.

00:11:17.999 --> 00:11:19.119
Sit down. We need a plan.

00:11:21.399 --> 00:11:22.399
Senior,

00:11:22.598 --> 00:11:24.239
you're truly remarkable.

00:11:24.399 --> 00:11:25.958
We need to figure out

00:11:26.119 --> 00:11:27.838
how to help you

00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.999
drop the beggar disguise.

00:11:30.318 --> 00:11:32.159
There is one solution.

00:11:32.678 --> 00:11:34.078
But it requires

00:11:34.119 --> 00:11:35.198
team work.

00:11:38.359 --> 00:11:39.879
Here, take a look.

00:11:40.838 --> 00:11:42.399
This is a tracking talisman.

00:11:42.639 --> 00:11:44.479
If we discreetly place it

00:11:44.479 --> 00:11:45.918
on those beggars,

00:11:46.718 --> 00:11:47.279
we can

00:11:47.438 --> 00:11:48.399
track down whoever

00:11:48.598 --> 00:11:49.558
is behind all this.

00:11:49.558 --> 00:11:51.159
Incredible.

00:11:51.159 --> 00:11:52.598
You're truly brilliant.

00:11:52.678 --> 00:11:53.639
Of course.

00:11:54.039 --> 00:11:55.519
The phrase "wise and mighty"

00:11:55.598 --> 00:11:57.239
were invented for me.

00:12:03.598 --> 00:12:05.958
I heard Liuguang Sect disciples
are all strong.

00:12:08.159 --> 00:12:09.078
Help me draw talismans.

00:12:10.798 --> 00:12:11.718
That won't do.

00:12:12.279 --> 00:12:13.558
Huan Zong isn't well.

00:12:13.639 --> 00:12:14.838
He can't overexert himself.

00:12:15.558 --> 00:12:16.359
I'll draw for you.

00:12:17.078 --> 00:12:18.078
You worry about him

00:12:18.119 --> 00:12:19.399
but not me tiring out?

00:12:19.519 --> 00:12:21.558
He's injured.

00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:26.838
Look.

00:12:26.918 --> 00:12:27.918
Coming out at night,

00:12:27.918 --> 00:12:28.999
you may get cold.

00:12:29.039 --> 00:12:30.078
Let me walk you home.

00:12:31.399 --> 00:12:31.759
Come on.

00:12:32.519 --> 00:12:33.759
Lin Hu, draw for him.

00:12:33.759 --> 00:12:34.279
Kong Hou.

00:12:36.119 --> 00:12:37.119
Kong Hou!

00:12:37.119 --> 00:12:38.759
I'll draw for you. Come on.

00:12:42.159 --> 00:12:43.159
I'm feeling unwell.

00:12:43.999 --> 00:12:44.639
Is your injury

00:12:44.639 --> 00:12:45.999
acting up again?

00:12:46.519 --> 00:12:48.198
You shouldn't have come out tonight.

00:12:48.639 --> 00:12:50.479
I'm fine. Don't worry.

00:12:57.239 --> 00:12:58.159
Get some rest.

00:12:58.359 --> 00:13:00.519
By the way,
where will Tan Feng sleep tonight?

00:13:00.879 --> 00:13:01.999
He...

00:13:02.359 --> 00:13:03.558
He can share my room.

00:13:03.639 --> 00:13:03.999
What?

00:13:05.239 --> 00:13:06.639
Outside my door.

00:13:06.798 --> 00:13:07.838
When I was little,

00:13:07.918 --> 00:13:09.119
I feared sleeping alone.

00:13:09.359 --> 00:13:11.039
Senior often slept outside my door.

00:13:11.198 --> 00:13:12.678
Now that we're traveling,

00:13:12.678 --> 00:13:14.438
he'll worry about me too.

00:13:14.639 --> 00:13:15.239
So

00:13:15.239 --> 00:13:16.078
he'll sleep

00:13:16.078 --> 00:13:17.078
outside my door.

00:13:18.359 --> 00:13:19.279
But you're grown now.

00:13:19.479 --> 00:13:20.718
Letting him sleep outside

00:13:20.718 --> 00:13:21.759
isn't appropriate.

00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.039
That's true.

00:13:23.438 --> 00:13:24.678
Can he share a room

00:13:24.678 --> 00:13:25.759
with Lin Hu?

00:13:25.999 --> 00:13:26.479
That works.

00:13:27.359 --> 00:13:28.718
Then sleep earlier.

00:13:28.918 --> 00:13:30.678
I'll go help him with talismans.

00:13:31.159 --> 00:13:31.558
Wait.

00:13:34.159 --> 00:13:34.798
Does

00:13:36.039 --> 00:13:37.078
your sect

00:13:37.279 --> 00:13:38.039
have any talismans

00:13:38.039 --> 00:13:39.718
for insomnia?

00:13:42.438 --> 00:13:43.318
No, actually.

00:13:43.399 --> 00:13:43.999
What's wrong?

00:13:44.399 --> 00:13:46.558
I feel

00:13:46.798 --> 00:13:47.718
a little dizzy

00:13:47.718 --> 00:13:48.879
yet not sleepy.

00:13:50.879 --> 00:13:52.039
I have an idea.

00:13:52.519 --> 00:13:53.479
When I was young,

00:13:53.598 --> 00:13:55.039
I used to have trouble sleeping too.

00:13:55.239 --> 00:13:56.039
Back then,

00:13:56.039 --> 00:13:57.718
seniors would tell me stories.

00:13:57.759 --> 00:13:58.279
Perhaps

00:13:58.318 --> 00:13:59.918
I can tell you one.

00:14:00.159 --> 00:14:01.479
This doesn't feel right.

00:14:01.479 --> 00:14:02.438
You're already weary.

00:14:02.838 --> 00:14:04.279
Just a few hours of being awake.

00:14:04.479 --> 00:14:05.039
It's okay.

00:14:05.318 --> 00:14:06.519
That won't do.

00:14:06.519 --> 00:14:07.438
Being unable to sleep

00:14:07.519 --> 00:14:08.718
is painful.

00:14:08.918 --> 00:14:09.479
Well,

00:14:09.798 --> 00:14:10.838
let me tell you

00:14:10.999 --> 00:14:12.078
a short tale.

00:14:12.359 --> 00:14:12.678
Okay.

00:14:12.798 --> 00:14:13.519
In the past...

00:14:17.078 --> 00:14:18.279
Why aren't you drawing?

00:14:19.318 --> 00:14:20.639
I'm not here for this.

00:14:23.198 --> 00:14:23.958
Then why come?

00:14:24.918 --> 00:14:25.718
To supervise you.

00:14:26.119 --> 00:14:26.999
Supervising me?

00:14:28.159 --> 00:14:28.918
Do you know

00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:29.879
I am

00:14:30.078 --> 00:14:31.639
one of the top disguise masters

00:14:31.759 --> 00:14:32.598
in the Lingyou Realm.

00:14:33.078 --> 00:14:34.318
Supervising me?

00:14:34.519 --> 00:14:35.438
Such bold words.

00:14:37.639 --> 00:14:38.558
All right.

00:14:39.078 --> 00:14:40.198
Don't you believe me?

00:14:40.438 --> 00:14:41.159
I'm telling you.

00:14:41.359 --> 00:14:42.198
These days,

00:14:42.399 --> 00:14:43.318
there was another guy

00:14:43.519 --> 00:14:44.598
disguised as a beggar.

00:14:45.119 --> 00:14:48.239
He's the renowned chief disciple

00:14:48.239 --> 00:14:51.198
of Zhaohan Sect,

00:14:52.359 --> 00:14:52.958
Chang De.

00:14:53.639 --> 00:14:54.759
Chang De of Zhaohan Sect?

00:14:54.879 --> 00:14:55.879
Yes.

00:14:57.119 --> 00:14:58.198
These past two years,

00:14:58.399 --> 00:15:00.119
he's been making waves.

00:15:00.318 --> 00:15:01.318
Everyone knows his name.

00:15:01.519 --> 00:15:02.838
But so what?

00:15:03.039 --> 00:15:04.759
He still got caught by the beggars,

00:15:04.798 --> 00:15:06.318
shoved into a blanket and kicked out

00:15:06.399 --> 00:15:07.039
like trash.

00:15:07.359 --> 00:15:08.239
But I

00:15:08.438 --> 00:15:09.438
infiltrated them.

00:15:10.039 --> 00:15:11.318
If you hadn't shown up,

00:15:11.479 --> 00:15:13.198
I'd have become a leader soon.

00:15:13.879 --> 00:15:15.279
(Chang De came here too?)

00:15:15.999 --> 00:15:17.558
(What about Ling Bo?)

00:15:19.239 --> 00:15:20.598
Did you see his junior,

00:15:20.678 --> 00:15:21.438
Ling Bo?

00:15:21.798 --> 00:15:22.239
No.

00:15:23.198 --> 00:15:24.384
Maybe I didn't recognize her.

00:15:25.318 --> 00:15:26.318
Alright, that's it.

00:15:26.598 --> 00:15:27.479
You got this.

00:15:27.519 --> 00:15:28.558
I'm off to find Kong Hou.

00:15:28.759 --> 00:15:29.519
Wait, wait!

00:15:30.759 --> 00:15:31.639
Senior Tan Feng.

00:15:32.279 --> 00:15:33.438
You're skilled at this,

00:15:33.598 --> 00:15:35.159
but I'm not.

00:15:35.359 --> 00:15:36.119
You must teach me.

00:15:36.318 --> 00:15:37.198
I'm already exhausted.

00:15:37.239 --> 00:15:38.039
I can't draw.

00:15:38.039 --> 00:15:38.598
Besides,

00:15:38.639 --> 00:15:39.798
I have more urgent matters.

00:15:39.838 --> 00:15:40.359
I need to go

00:15:40.359 --> 00:15:41.639
find that brat Huan Zong.

00:15:42.999 --> 00:15:43.999
Senior Tan Feng.

00:15:44.479 --> 00:15:46.359
Young Master just recovered.

00:15:46.519 --> 00:15:47.399
He's resting.

00:15:47.399 --> 00:15:48.119
Must be asleep.

00:15:48.279 --> 00:15:49.119
You're such a master

00:15:49.119 --> 00:15:50.759
in Lingyou Realm.

00:15:50.999 --> 00:15:51.798
It's rare

00:15:51.999 --> 00:15:53.318
I get to learn from you.

00:15:53.438 --> 00:15:53.918
Please

00:15:53.918 --> 00:15:55.198
show your technique

00:15:55.279 --> 00:15:56.359
and let me admire.

00:16:00.279 --> 00:16:00.879
Well-mannered.

00:16:01.198 --> 00:16:01.718
Come on.

00:16:02.519 --> 00:16:03.879
I'll show you once.

00:16:16.598 --> 00:16:17.918
Leaving?

00:16:20.159 --> 00:16:22.119
I thought you were asleep.

00:16:22.798 --> 00:16:23.438
It's fine.

00:16:24.279 --> 00:16:25.198
Go find your senior.

00:16:25.399 --> 00:16:26.279
He must be waiting.

00:16:26.598 --> 00:16:28.438
Can you sleep now?

00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:30.078
No worries.

00:16:30.598 --> 00:16:31.598
If I can't sleep,

00:16:32.918 --> 00:16:33.759
I'll just meditate.

00:16:33.759 --> 00:16:34.678
Meditate, now.

00:16:36.359 --> 00:16:37.239
Huan Zong.

00:16:37.519 --> 00:16:38.519
I've told you

00:16:38.519 --> 00:16:39.639
so many stories.

00:16:39.838 --> 00:16:41.479
Why are you still not sleepy?

00:16:42.598 --> 00:16:43.479
I don't know.

00:16:44.119 --> 00:16:44.879
It doesn't matter.

00:16:44.918 --> 00:16:45.639
Don't worry.

00:16:45.838 --> 00:16:47.119
A day or two won't kill me.

00:16:47.119 --> 00:16:47.558
It's okay.

00:16:48.399 --> 00:16:49.359
No. Wait.

00:16:50.039 --> 00:16:52.359
I've still got plenty of stories.

00:16:52.598 --> 00:16:54.519
Let me think of another.

00:16:54.519 --> 00:16:54.999
Alright.

00:16:55.639 --> 00:16:56.318
Let me think.

00:16:57.958 --> 00:16:59.239
Got one.

00:16:59.239 --> 00:17:00.039
I guarantee

00:17:00.039 --> 00:17:01.359
you've never heard it.

00:17:01.798 --> 00:17:04.479
Once upon a time,
there were two families

00:17:04.679 --> 00:17:06.118
locked in generational hatred.

00:17:06.679 --> 00:17:07.638
But

00:17:07.838 --> 00:17:09.039
their son and daughter

00:17:09.239 --> 00:17:10.398
fell in love.

00:17:10.719 --> 00:17:12.158
The parents...

00:17:17.158 --> 00:17:18.479
I'm not sleepy.

(came to the sect,)

00:18:02.318 --> 00:18:03.719
(I feared sleeping alone at night.)

00:18:03.959 --> 00:18:04.719

it was your senior watched over you.

No pushing!

00:18:23.798 --> 00:18:24.838
Enough for everyone.

00:18:24.999 --> 00:18:25.999
No need to rush.

00:18:25.999 --> 00:18:26.999

- Thanks.

00:18:32.558 --> 00:18:33.158
Take this.

00:18:35.398 --> 00:18:36.118
- Mine.
- Mine.

00:18:37.318 --> 00:18:38.199
Careful.

00:18:38.279 --> 00:18:38.759
Thank you.

00:18:39.078 --> 00:18:39.638
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

00:18:39.638 --> 00:18:40.279
Here.

00:18:40.519 --> 00:18:41.999
Take and leave!

00:18:43.118 --> 00:18:43.638
Line up!

00:18:43.638 --> 00:18:44.479
Stop grabbing!

00:18:46.118 --> 00:18:46.598
Stop!

00:18:46.598 --> 00:18:47.078
Stop it!

00:18:47.078 --> 00:18:48.759
This is West Faction's territory!

00:18:48.759 --> 00:18:49.759
Why are you pushing me?

00:18:49.999 --> 00:18:50.679
Nonsense!

00:18:50.679 --> 00:18:51.558
Look at the city gate.

00:18:51.679 --> 00:18:52.398
It's clearly

00:18:52.479 --> 00:18:53.199
our

00:18:53.199 --> 00:18:54.158
East Faction's domain!

00:18:54.199 --> 00:18:54.719
Pah!

00:18:54.878 --> 00:18:55.638
West Faction!

00:18:55.719 --> 00:18:56.439
East Faction!

00:18:56.519 --> 00:18:57.118
West Faction!

00:18:57.118 --> 00:18:58.199
East Faction!

00:18:58.798 --> 00:18:59.679
West! West!

00:19:03.838 --> 00:19:04.719
Stop yelling!

00:19:04.878 --> 00:19:06.479
Stop!

00:19:06.558 --> 00:19:08.279
Whether East Faction or West Faction,

00:19:08.479 --> 00:19:10.039
everyone gets one roast chicken.

00:19:10.039 --> 00:19:11.199
No grabbing. Form a line!

00:19:11.519 --> 00:19:12.199
No way!

00:19:12.398 --> 00:19:13.398
Ever since their East man

00:19:13.398 --> 00:19:14.959
broke off the engagement with our girl,

00:19:15.118 --> 00:19:15.759
we West Faction

00:19:15.838 --> 00:19:17.078
swore to never forgive them!

00:19:17.279 --> 00:19:19.318
We people choose partners freely.

00:19:19.519 --> 00:19:21.999
Unless marriage is finalized,
it's not breaking an engagement!

00:19:22.239 --> 00:19:23.039
Pah!

00:19:42.719 --> 00:19:44.358
Chicken's not even passed out.

00:19:44.558 --> 00:19:45.919
Huan Zong, what should we do?

00:19:46.078 --> 00:19:46.999
There's another way.

00:19:48.078 --> 00:19:48.759
Go.

00:19:50.358 --> 00:19:51.239
Stop fighting! Stop!

00:19:58.039 --> 00:19:59.199
Lin Hu's impressive.

00:19:59.398 --> 00:20:00.959
He's got real skills.

00:20:07.999 --> 00:20:09.118
All of you, stop fighting!

00:20:10.318 --> 00:20:11.199
Stop it!

00:20:30.358 --> 00:20:31.158
If this continues,

00:20:31.158 --> 00:20:32.199
it'll get worse.

00:20:32.638 --> 00:20:33.798
We must stop them.

00:20:34.558 --> 00:20:35.318
Huan Zong.

00:20:35.439 --> 00:20:35.919
Remember

00:20:35.919 --> 00:20:37.039
the story I told you?

00:20:37.959 --> 00:20:38.598
Which one?

00:20:39.759 --> 00:20:40.239
Follow me.

00:20:42.679 --> 00:20:43.838
Stop!

00:20:46.838 --> 00:20:48.598
Huan Zong, act in a play with me.

00:20:48.719 --> 00:20:49.519
The one

00:20:49.519 --> 00:20:51.039
I told you yesterday.

00:20:51.279 --> 00:20:52.279
There were two families

00:20:52.279 --> 00:20:53.318
in generational feud.

00:20:53.398 --> 00:20:54.759
But their son and daughter

00:20:54.759 --> 00:20:55.558
fell in love.

00:20:55.919 --> 00:20:58.759
They planned to die together

00:20:58.759 --> 00:21:00.558
to end the families' hatred.

00:21:03.078 --> 00:21:03.919
Acting?

00:21:03.959 --> 00:21:04.759
I don't know how.

00:21:04.959 --> 00:21:05.598
No worries.

00:21:05.838 --> 00:21:06.838
Just follow my lead.

00:21:08.959 --> 00:21:10.959
Someone's going
to jump off the city gate!

00:21:11.118 --> 00:21:12.558
Help!

00:21:12.638 --> 00:21:14.679
A jumper at the city gate!

00:21:16.039 --> 00:21:16.759
This...

00:21:18.078 --> 00:21:18.878
Who is it?

00:21:18.999 --> 00:21:20.358
Why are they jumping?

00:21:23.318 --> 00:21:24.118
Watch carefully.

00:21:26.519 --> 00:21:27.798
Everyone!

00:21:27.959 --> 00:21:29.358
Everyone!

00:21:29.999 --> 00:21:31.959
Huan Zong and I, Kong Hou,

00:21:32.199 --> 00:21:33.838
we truly love each other.

00:21:34.078 --> 00:21:34.999
What?

00:21:35.239 --> 00:21:36.158
Love each other.

00:21:36.239 --> 00:21:37.519
What? Love each other?

00:21:37.638 --> 00:21:37.959
You...

00:21:37.959 --> 00:21:38.439
Don't.

00:21:38.919 --> 00:21:39.878
It's an act!

00:21:40.039 --> 00:21:41.838
An act, got it?

00:21:41.999 --> 00:21:45.878
We love each other!

00:21:47.759 --> 00:21:48.759
Love?

00:21:48.999 --> 00:21:50.239
Quiet, quiet.

00:21:51.479 --> 00:21:52.798
This is true love!

00:21:54.239 --> 00:21:55.118
Now,

00:21:55.358 --> 00:21:57.838
if we can't be together in this life,

00:21:58.199 --> 00:21:59.439
we'll jump

00:21:59.439 --> 00:22:00.398
from this city gate.

00:22:01.199 --> 00:22:03.598
We'll stay together

00:22:04.039 --> 00:22:05.878
even in the underworld!

00:22:07.638 --> 00:22:08.558
This won't do.

00:22:08.608 --> 00:22:10.208
The East and West are feuding factions.

00:22:10.439 --> 00:22:11.199
Quick!

00:22:11.519 --> 00:22:13.878
Hug me!

00:22:15.118 --> 00:22:16.479
Like this?

00:22:16.719 --> 00:22:17.679
Tighter.

00:22:18.999 --> 00:22:21.039
They're still acting. It's fine.

00:22:21.039 --> 00:22:21.479
Like this?

00:22:23.519 --> 00:22:24.999
Now caress my...

00:22:25.158 --> 00:22:25.878
Caress my hair.

00:22:27.439 --> 00:22:29.078
Why are you so stiff?

00:22:29.318 --> 00:22:30.679
Can't you be gentler?

00:22:30.919 --> 00:22:32.558
Passion. Got it?

00:22:38.279 --> 00:22:39.759
Weren't you going to jump?

00:22:39.838 --> 00:22:40.759
Why aren't you jumping?

00:22:40.999 --> 00:22:43.158
- Yeah! Jump!
- Jump!

00:22:43.239 --> 00:22:44.039
Jump!

00:22:44.239 --> 00:22:46.279
Why this reaction?

00:22:46.558 --> 00:22:48.519
Why aren't they moved at all?

00:22:49.279 --> 00:22:51.279
Our acting must be unconvincing.

00:22:52.479 --> 00:22:53.638
Everyone!

00:22:53.759 --> 00:22:54.999
Please listen.

00:22:55.598 --> 00:22:56.999
Huan Zong and I, Kong Hou,

00:22:57.158 --> 00:22:58.598
we truly love each other.

00:22:59.118 --> 00:23:00.878
We have but one wish.

00:23:01.158 --> 00:23:02.158
To

00:23:03.638 --> 00:23:04.638
get married!

00:23:05.878 --> 00:23:06.598
Get married?

00:23:06.759 --> 00:23:07.999
She...

00:23:08.078 --> 00:23:09.039
It's an act.

00:23:09.878 --> 00:23:11.199
Everyone present here

00:23:11.439 --> 00:23:13.039
is our witness.

00:23:13.239 --> 00:23:15.999
We wouldn't be separated.

00:23:16.318 --> 00:23:18.838
Huan Zong, will you marry me?

00:23:23.878 --> 00:23:25.679
Will you?

00:23:27.519 --> 00:23:28.160
Yes, I will.

00:23:29.959 --> 00:23:30.638
Everyone!

00:23:31.158 --> 00:23:32.679
He agreed!

00:23:32.919 --> 00:23:35.118
He agreed to marry me!

00:23:36.398 --> 00:23:38.199
(She wants me to play along.)

00:23:38.358 --> 00:23:39.558
(But they... Well...)

00:23:39.558 --> 00:23:41.479
Right! We shouldn't...

00:23:41.479 --> 00:23:42.398
We can't keep

00:23:42.398 --> 00:23:43.439
the feud going.

00:23:43.638 --> 00:23:43.959
Exactly!

00:23:43.959 --> 00:23:45.759
Don't let lovers die for the feud.

00:23:46.039 --> 00:23:47.679
East and West factions

00:23:47.878 --> 00:23:49.519
must end this enmity.

00:23:49.519 --> 00:23:50.078
We must!

00:23:50.078 --> 00:23:51.959
If they die because of this,

00:23:52.199 --> 00:23:53.999
we're all guilty!

00:23:54.239 --> 00:23:57.039
- Exactly!
- This must stop!

00:23:59.199 --> 00:24:00.558
We can't watch lovers

00:24:00.798 --> 00:24:01.999
jump before our eyes.

00:24:04.439 --> 00:24:05.199
This girl...

00:24:05.279 --> 00:24:06.479
I think I saw her earlier.

00:24:06.679 --> 00:24:07.959
Yes! I saw her too!

00:24:08.199 --> 00:24:08.558
Me too!

00:24:08.558 --> 00:24:09.519
Are they lying?

00:24:10.078 --> 00:24:11.558
Huan Zong, what should we do?

00:24:11.798 --> 00:24:12.479
Now

00:24:12.479 --> 00:24:13.878
they doubt us again.

00:24:14.039 --> 00:24:15.118
No choice.

00:24:24.638 --> 00:24:25.558
They kissed!

00:24:28.679 --> 00:24:29.719
He really kissed her!

00:24:32.798 --> 00:24:33.398
Come down now.

00:24:33.638 --> 00:24:34.439
Come down!

00:24:34.959 --> 00:24:36.078
We'll stop fighting.

00:24:39.199 --> 00:24:39.919
Senior Tan Feng!

00:24:40.118 --> 00:24:41.158
Wake up, Senior Tan Feng!

00:24:41.719 --> 00:24:42.358
You're awake.

00:24:42.598 --> 00:24:43.519
What are you doing?

00:24:43.519 --> 00:24:44.239
I am...

00:24:46.279 --> 00:24:47.078
Look, roast chicken.

00:24:50.479 --> 00:24:50.878
What now?

00:24:50.878 --> 00:24:51.398
Help me up.

00:24:51.398 --> 00:24:52.199
Hurry!

00:24:53.759 --> 00:24:56.558
Really delicious!

00:24:57.078 --> 00:24:57.999
What now?

00:24:58.239 --> 00:24:58.959
Where's Kong Hou?

00:24:58.999 --> 00:25:00.039
How would I know?

00:25:00.318 --> 00:25:01.118
I have to go.

00:25:01.199 --> 00:25:02.078
Search yourself.

00:25:04.558 --> 00:25:05.479
Where's Kong Hou?

00:25:06.199 --> 00:25:06.999
Kong Hou!

00:25:09.999 --> 00:25:10.759
Admit fault or not?

00:25:11.158 --> 00:25:12.398
Senior,

00:25:12.638 --> 00:25:13.479
Huan Zong and I

00:25:13.479 --> 00:25:15.118
are truly just

00:25:15.118 --> 00:25:16.039
close friends.

00:25:16.199 --> 00:25:17.638
Nothing like what you think.

00:25:17.638 --> 00:25:18.358
Can good friends

00:25:18.358 --> 00:25:19.318
hug and kiss casually?

00:25:19.798 --> 00:25:20.759
You don't know it,

00:25:20.798 --> 00:25:21.878
and he didn't refuse!

00:25:22.358 --> 00:25:23.358
I already told you.

00:25:23.358 --> 00:25:24.199
He's not a good man.

00:25:24.479 --> 00:25:25.199
Kong Hou.

00:25:25.358 --> 00:25:26.558
Listen to me.

00:25:26.598 --> 00:25:27.479
Stay away from him,

00:25:27.479 --> 00:25:28.558
okay?

00:25:28.719 --> 00:25:30.398
It wasn't his fault.

00:25:30.638 --> 00:25:31.878
I forced him to act this out.

00:25:31.919 --> 00:25:32.519
Senior,

00:25:32.759 --> 00:25:34.239
please don't blame him.

00:25:34.358 --> 00:25:36.078
You're still defending him?

00:25:36.118 --> 00:25:37.479
You're completely under his spell.

00:25:37.558 --> 00:25:38.838
I'll knock some sense into you.

00:25:42.479 --> 00:25:43.039
Huan Zong.

00:25:43.999 --> 00:25:44.798
Senior Tan Feng.

00:25:45.358 --> 00:25:46.878
It's all my fault today,

00:25:47.118 --> 00:25:48.199
not hers.

00:25:48.919 --> 00:25:50.158
This is our sect business.

00:25:50.358 --> 00:25:51.638
You have no right to interfere.

00:25:53.158 --> 00:25:53.638
Let go!

00:26:00.798 --> 00:26:01.318
Huan Zong.

00:26:01.598 --> 00:26:03.558
Let go. I'm fine.

00:26:04.919 --> 00:26:06.039
Forgive me.

00:26:08.039 --> 00:26:08.439
You...

00:26:09.199 --> 00:26:09.959
Senior Tan Feng.

00:26:10.239 --> 00:26:11.039
Don't be mad.

00:26:11.838 --> 00:26:12.919
If you're angry,

00:26:13.039 --> 00:26:14.039
just take it out on me.

00:26:14.239 --> 00:26:15.878
But I want to make something clear.

00:26:16.638 --> 00:26:17.959
Regarding today's events,

00:26:18.239 --> 00:26:19.479
Kong Hou wasn't wrong at all.

00:26:19.719 --> 00:26:20.878
She actually deserves credit.

00:26:21.439 --> 00:26:22.078
Credit?

00:26:25.199 --> 00:26:26.999
She used the food distribution

00:26:27.078 --> 00:26:28.358
to send tracking talismans.

00:26:28.679 --> 00:26:29.679
That's the first merit.

00:26:29.838 --> 00:26:32.039
Second, during the chaos,

00:26:32.279 --> 00:26:33.679
she improvised a whole act

00:26:33.679 --> 00:26:34.838
to distract everyone.

00:26:35.358 --> 00:26:36.759
Third, the disputes

00:26:36.798 --> 00:26:38.919
between East and West factions

00:26:39.318 --> 00:26:40.439
are completely resolved.

00:26:41.598 --> 00:26:42.719
Even if she did good,

00:26:42.838 --> 00:26:44.118
she must keep propriety.

00:26:44.519 --> 00:26:45.118
Listen.

00:26:45.558 --> 00:26:46.919
Stay away from her from now on.

00:26:46.919 --> 00:26:48.039
Don't want to see you again.

00:26:48.039 --> 00:26:49.838
That's impossible.

00:26:50.118 --> 00:26:50.919
What did you say?

00:26:52.959 --> 00:26:53.519
Because

00:26:53.878 --> 00:26:55.318
I want to see her.

00:26:56.759 --> 00:26:57.999
Who do you think you are?

00:26:57.999 --> 00:26:59.199
You want to see her?

00:27:00.239 --> 00:27:00.838
I...

00:27:02.679 --> 00:27:04.118
I suppose I'm her friend.

00:27:05.519 --> 00:27:06.158
Senior Tan Feng.

00:27:06.719 --> 00:27:07.838
I know you care for her.

00:27:08.398 --> 00:27:09.039
But Kong Hou

00:27:09.039 --> 00:27:10.318
has now grown up.

00:27:10.719 --> 00:27:12.039
She can make her own choices.

00:27:12.959 --> 00:27:14.398
So I won't stay away from her.

00:27:14.679 --> 00:27:15.878
I'll continue accompanying her

00:27:16.118 --> 00:27:16.878
on her journey.

00:27:18.719 --> 00:27:19.638
Show me your hand.

00:27:23.558 --> 00:27:24.239
It hurts.

00:27:25.638 --> 00:27:27.318
Let's go get you medicated.

00:27:31.919 --> 00:27:33.878
This will sting. Hold still.

00:27:34.078 --> 00:27:34.999
It's fine.

00:27:35.158 --> 00:27:35.759
You

00:27:35.759 --> 00:27:37.199
took a hit for me.

00:27:37.279 --> 00:27:38.679
Besides, Senior Tan Feng

00:27:38.679 --> 00:27:39.919
wouldn't hit me seriously.

00:27:42.598 --> 00:27:43.838
Why does it hurt so much?

00:27:45.078 --> 00:27:45.719
Stay still.

00:27:47.838 --> 00:27:48.358
Huan Zong.

00:27:48.638 --> 00:27:49.798
I remember

00:27:49.798 --> 00:27:51.039
in the Forbidden Forest,

00:27:51.598 --> 00:27:52.479
you were injured too.

00:27:52.479 --> 00:27:54.118
Then you just

00:27:54.118 --> 00:27:54.878
waved your hand

00:27:54.878 --> 00:27:56.199
and then, your wounds healed.

00:27:56.398 --> 00:27:58.039
Can't you do that for me too?

00:27:58.158 --> 00:27:58.719
Alright?

00:27:59.118 --> 00:27:59.519
The ruler

00:27:59.519 --> 00:28:00.798
is specifically for punishment.

00:28:01.279 --> 00:28:02.638
The wounds caused are different

00:28:02.719 --> 00:28:04.199
from cuts or scrapes.

00:28:04.679 --> 00:28:06.199
Not so easy

00:28:06.598 --> 00:28:07.479
to heal.

00:28:07.999 --> 00:28:09.398
You must apply medicine properly.

00:28:09.679 --> 00:28:10.318
Endure it.

00:28:10.838 --> 00:28:11.638
I've never

00:28:11.679 --> 00:28:13.598
been struck with a ruler before.

00:28:14.158 --> 00:28:15.638
But Huan Zong,

00:28:15.959 --> 00:28:17.838
how do you know so much about this?

00:28:18.519 --> 00:28:20.158
Were also a naughty kid before

00:28:20.279 --> 00:28:21.638
and often got beaten

00:28:21.679 --> 00:28:23.838
with a discipline ruler?

00:28:23.959 --> 00:28:25.039
Not at all.

00:28:25.798 --> 00:28:26.959
I know this because

00:28:27.439 --> 00:28:28.919
when disciples of Luanfeng Peak

00:28:28.919 --> 00:28:29.679
disobey orders,

00:28:29.679 --> 00:28:31.158
I'd hit them with ruler.

00:28:31.878 --> 00:28:33.479
You hit them?

00:28:36.078 --> 00:28:37.039
Ouch!

00:28:42.439 --> 00:28:44.039
If it hurts too much,

00:28:44.759 --> 00:28:45.318
hold onto me.

00:28:46.158 --> 00:28:47.439
Harder, it's fine.

00:28:49.878 --> 00:28:50.519
Huan Zong.

00:28:50.959 --> 00:28:52.199
You're so nice to me.

00:28:56.158 --> 00:28:57.239
Back on the tower,

00:28:57.239 --> 00:28:58.479
you cooperated so well.

00:28:59.158 --> 00:29:01.598
If you hadn't kissed me right then,

00:29:01.598 --> 00:29:02.358
nobody

00:29:02.398 --> 00:29:03.919
would've believed us.

00:29:04.199 --> 00:29:05.358
You're so good at acting.

00:29:09.838 --> 00:29:10.519
What if

00:29:13.078 --> 00:29:14.519
it's not an act?

00:29:17.638 --> 00:29:18.759
Not an act?

00:29:20.398 --> 00:29:21.519
Then what was it?

00:29:22.679 --> 00:29:23.296
Never mind.

00:29:24.239 --> 00:29:25.439
You'll understand later.

00:29:28.398 --> 00:29:30.199
This is so great.

00:29:30.199 --> 00:29:31.039
Indeed.

00:29:35.199 --> 00:29:35.638
Sis,

00:29:35.919 --> 00:29:36.558
tell me.

00:29:36.838 --> 00:29:38.158
Why aren't you staying

00:29:38.199 --> 00:29:39.398
in that broken temple tonight?

00:29:43.558 --> 00:29:44.158
Here.

00:29:45.838 --> 00:29:46.759
Haven't you heard?

00:29:47.239 --> 00:29:49.158
That temple's haunted.

00:29:49.798 --> 00:29:50.759
No way.

00:29:50.959 --> 00:29:53.039
An old widower from the east city

00:29:53.158 --> 00:29:54.439
has been living there.

00:29:54.679 --> 00:29:55.598
Days ago,

00:29:55.598 --> 00:29:56.959
he came back late

00:29:57.199 --> 00:29:58.158
from begging

00:29:58.439 --> 00:29:59.679
and saw a haunting.

00:29:59.919 --> 00:30:00.759
It scared him

00:30:01.358 --> 00:30:02.959
half-mad.

00:30:04.878 --> 00:30:05.999
Maybe he's just

00:30:05.999 --> 00:30:06.878
making up stories.

00:30:06.999 --> 00:30:07.759
Anyway, I won't

00:30:07.759 --> 00:30:08.558
go back there.

00:30:08.638 --> 00:30:09.398
If you dare,

00:30:09.759 --> 00:30:10.558
go with them.

00:30:14.519 --> 00:30:15.279
Haunted?

00:30:16.519 --> 00:30:18.199
Maybe it's dark cultivators.

00:30:18.479 --> 00:30:19.199
I need to check.

00:30:20.598 --> 00:30:21.439
Y-You...

00:30:23.439 --> 00:30:24.439
Let me see.

00:30:25.479 --> 00:30:27.398
It really is you, Lady Ling Bo!

00:30:27.679 --> 00:30:29.078
What happened to you?

00:30:29.959 --> 00:30:30.759
To be honest,

00:30:30.959 --> 00:30:31.919
this beggar look

00:30:32.039 --> 00:30:33.279
suits your temperament.

00:30:33.358 --> 00:30:34.598
Stop talking nonsense.

00:30:34.598 --> 00:30:35.318
Or I'll rip off

00:30:35.318 --> 00:30:36.239
your fox tail.

00:30:36.598 --> 00:30:37.999
Why are you dressed this way?

00:30:38.199 --> 00:30:39.439
I'm investigating clues.

00:30:39.439 --> 00:30:40.638
No room for vanity here.

00:30:40.679 --> 00:30:41.838
Investigating?

00:30:42.039 --> 00:30:44.558
Lady Ling Bo of Zhaohan Sect

00:30:44.759 --> 00:30:45.798
plays beggar

00:30:45.798 --> 00:30:47.479
for merit?

00:30:48.838 --> 00:30:50.759
You always call me a stinky fox.

00:30:50.759 --> 00:30:52.279
Which of us smells worse now?

00:30:52.959 --> 00:30:53.358
You...

00:30:53.479 --> 00:30:54.118
Alright.

00:30:54.199 --> 00:30:54.959
Stay back.

00:30:55.358 --> 00:30:56.199
What's the status?

00:30:56.798 --> 00:30:57.798
If you hadn't shown up,

00:30:57.798 --> 00:30:59.078
I would've finished already.

00:30:59.279 --> 00:31:00.558
What's that supposed to mean?

00:31:00.598 --> 00:31:01.638
Too many people there,

00:31:01.838 --> 00:31:02.638
I couldn't talk.

00:31:02.638 --> 00:31:03.878
Or I won't come here!

00:31:04.519 --> 00:31:05.919
Just get to the point.

00:31:06.439 --> 00:31:07.759
Those beggars

00:31:07.759 --> 00:31:08.759
are suspicious.

00:31:08.798 --> 00:31:09.598
Be careful

00:31:09.598 --> 00:31:10.598
while you're with them.

00:31:10.798 --> 00:31:12.118
I don't need your warnings.

00:31:13.239 --> 00:31:15.279
Let's exchange messenger talismans.

00:31:15.279 --> 00:31:16.638
Contact me if you need help.

00:31:17.519 --> 00:31:18.638
Think I can't handle it?

00:31:18.878 --> 00:31:19.999
I mean

00:31:19.999 --> 00:31:21.239
you gave the roast chicken

00:31:21.279 --> 00:31:22.336
with tracking talismans.

00:31:22.336 --> 00:31:24.224
No tracking talismans,
no messenger talismans.

00:31:24.224 --> 00:31:25.638
If danger comes, what can you do?

00:31:25.759 --> 00:31:27.158
Tracking talismans?

00:31:29.239 --> 00:31:30.959
So it was you all along.

00:31:30.959 --> 00:31:31.919
Handing out chicken

00:31:32.078 --> 00:31:33.078
and tracking talismans.

00:31:33.078 --> 00:31:34.638
What are you acting?

00:31:34.999 --> 00:31:35.679
To monitor

00:31:35.679 --> 00:31:36.919
their movements!

00:31:38.919 --> 00:31:39.759
Alright.

00:31:39.999 --> 00:31:40.679
Take it.

00:31:40.959 --> 00:31:41.838
If anything happens,

00:31:41.838 --> 00:31:42.919
contact me immediately.

00:31:43.638 --> 00:31:44.959
Alright, I'm leaving.

00:31:45.479 --> 00:31:46.239
Keep it safe.

00:31:46.279 --> 00:31:47.519
Remember to message me.

00:31:47.519 --> 00:31:48.798
Be careful!

00:31:50.679 --> 00:31:51.158
Well,

00:31:51.798 --> 00:31:52.519
still charming.

00:32:10.479 --> 00:32:12.158
It's an act.

00:32:12.798 --> 00:32:13.679
An act.

00:32:22.638 --> 00:32:23.439
Then...

00:32:24.519 --> 00:32:25.959
What if it's not an act?

00:32:27.719 --> 00:32:29.078
Not an act?

00:32:29.878 --> 00:32:30.719
Then what is it?

00:32:40.558 --> 00:32:41.279
Kong Hou.

00:32:41.638 --> 00:32:42.959
Listen to me.

00:32:42.959 --> 00:32:43.919
Stay away

00:32:43.919 --> 00:32:44.919
from him.

00:32:45.318 --> 00:32:46.279
Senior Tan Feng.

00:32:46.558 --> 00:32:47.439
Huan Zong and I

00:32:47.519 --> 00:32:49.158
are truly just

00:32:49.158 --> 00:32:50.158
close friends.

00:32:50.279 --> 00:32:52.078
Nothing like what you think.

00:33:39.398 --> 00:33:40.439
(He's been gone so long,)

00:33:40.439 --> 00:33:41.318
(still not back yet.)

00:33:41.759 --> 00:33:43.318
(Has something happened to him?)

00:33:59.798 --> 00:34:01.358
Senior, eat some fish.

00:34:02.759 --> 00:34:03.558
No.

00:34:06.318 --> 00:34:08.078
Senior, try this bun.

00:34:08.359 --> 00:34:09.399
No.

00:34:13.839 --> 00:34:15.598
Eat this chicken leg.

00:34:15.919 --> 00:34:16.718
No.

00:34:17.919 --> 00:34:18.758
Senior Tan Feng.

00:34:18.959 --> 00:34:20.039
I remember

00:34:20.039 --> 00:34:21.238
that's your favorite.

00:34:21.479 --> 00:34:22.558
Why aren't you eating?

00:34:23.678 --> 00:34:25.479
You don't have

00:34:25.479 --> 00:34:26.319
to remember that.

00:34:26.479 --> 00:34:28.078
I'm just your senior,

00:34:28.839 --> 00:34:29.919
not your

00:34:29.919 --> 00:34:33.039
"close friend".

00:34:38.718 --> 00:34:39.678
Senior.

00:34:39.959 --> 00:34:41.238
I was wrong.

00:34:41.359 --> 00:34:43.479
I'm apologizing.

00:34:45.078 --> 00:34:46.399
Senior Tan Feng.

00:34:46.638 --> 00:34:48.198
Kong Hou's apologized.

00:34:48.359 --> 00:34:49.319
Your words yesterday

00:34:49.359 --> 00:34:50.359
worked wonders.

00:34:50.439 --> 00:34:52.039
You should be happy. Why be angry?

00:34:52.278 --> 00:34:53.319
Don't want chicken leg?

00:34:53.319 --> 00:34:53.839
Here,

00:34:54.479 --> 00:34:55.359
try a duck leg.

00:34:55.678 --> 00:34:56.118
Here.

00:34:56.879 --> 00:34:57.439
What?

00:34:58.439 --> 00:34:59.238
Okay, fine.

00:34:59.558 --> 00:35:00.678
We're talking.

00:35:00.718 --> 00:35:01.479
Why you bother?

00:35:02.519 --> 00:35:03.439
Senior Tan Feng.

00:35:03.799 --> 00:35:05.238
What exactly

00:35:05.238 --> 00:35:06.238
do you want us to do?

00:35:06.999 --> 00:35:07.999
"Us"?

00:35:08.278 --> 00:35:09.399
Are you saying

00:35:09.399 --> 00:35:10.758
"us"?

00:35:10.919 --> 00:35:11.799
Now am I

00:35:11.799 --> 00:35:12.879
the outsider?

00:35:12.879 --> 00:35:13.638
I-I...

00:35:13.959 --> 00:35:15.758
That's not what I meant.

00:35:15.758 --> 00:35:16.359
Don't explain.

00:35:16.758 --> 00:35:17.359
Even if

00:35:17.359 --> 00:35:18.598
Master's here today,

00:35:18.718 --> 00:35:19.839
he can't compare with them!

00:35:24.399 --> 00:35:26.078
Senior!

00:35:26.758 --> 00:35:28.319
Tears won't help.

00:35:28.999 --> 00:35:30.359
When you were making mistakes,

00:35:30.359 --> 00:35:31.238
I couldn't stop it.

00:35:32.238 --> 00:35:34.758
I'm better off letting go.

00:35:41.678 --> 00:35:42.519
Senior.

00:35:43.278 --> 00:35:44.359
I'm sorry.

00:35:44.879 --> 00:35:45.959
From now on,

00:35:46.078 --> 00:35:47.198
I won't bother you anymore.

00:35:50.158 --> 00:35:51.118
Where are you going?

00:35:56.078 --> 00:35:57.118
Stubborn girl!

00:35:57.319 --> 00:35:58.198
Fine, just go!

00:36:00.598 --> 00:36:01.598
But

00:36:02.558 --> 00:36:04.118
Kong Hou's new here.

00:36:04.319 --> 00:36:05.399
She may run into danger.

00:36:05.999 --> 00:36:08.158
She said you're close.

00:36:08.439 --> 00:36:09.799
Maybe

00:36:10.519 --> 00:36:11.278
the deeper

00:36:12.399 --> 00:36:14.718
the affection, the harsher the scolding.

00:36:19.479 --> 00:36:20.558
I've lost my appetite.

00:36:22.399 --> 00:36:23.399
There's been talk

00:36:23.399 --> 00:36:25.439
of dark cultivators in Fengyi.

00:36:25.638 --> 00:36:27.399
Well, I'd better go check.

00:36:27.439 --> 00:36:28.118
Dark cultivators?

00:36:31.039 --> 00:36:31.558
Young Master.

00:36:34.278 --> 00:36:35.479
Quite the performance.

00:36:35.519 --> 00:36:36.598
The world down mountains

00:36:36.638 --> 00:36:37.879
really rubs off on people.

00:36:37.999 --> 00:36:39.238
Even you've learned to act.

00:36:40.799 --> 00:36:41.439
Kong Hou!

00:36:42.839 --> 00:36:43.519
Kong Hou!

00:36:43.799 --> 00:36:44.439
- Young Master.
- Kong Hou.

00:36:44.439 --> 00:36:46.319
Lady Kong Hou

00:36:46.319 --> 00:36:47.839
is still a young girl.

00:36:47.919 --> 00:36:49.238
Girls are sensitive

00:36:49.319 --> 00:36:50.598
and prone to overthinking.

00:36:50.638 --> 00:36:51.479
Overthinking

00:36:51.479 --> 00:36:52.598
leads to rash decisions.

00:36:52.638 --> 00:36:54.118
What if she encounters

00:36:54.158 --> 00:36:55.399
dark cultivators?

00:36:55.399 --> 00:36:56.198
What should we do?

00:36:56.238 --> 00:36:56.558
Stop

00:36:56.638 --> 00:36:57.519
such ominous words!

00:36:57.598 --> 00:36:58.839
Danger? Dark cultivators?

00:36:59.039 --> 00:37:00.158
I'm her Senior!

00:37:00.278 --> 00:37:01.638
I know she's sharp.

00:37:02.198 --> 00:37:03.118
Fine.

00:37:03.638 --> 00:37:04.839
Don't worry.

00:37:04.919 --> 00:37:05.558
By our presence,

00:37:05.558 --> 00:37:06.479
Kong Hou will be fine.

00:37:06.558 --> 00:37:06.999
Right.

00:37:07.919 --> 00:37:08.519
Go search her.

00:37:08.959 --> 00:37:10.158
Or you have to pay.

00:37:10.638 --> 00:37:11.758
Have to pay.

00:37:12.319 --> 00:37:12.919
Let's go.

00:37:13.879 --> 00:37:14.758
Kong Hou!

00:37:14.758 --> 00:37:15.519
Where's she?

00:37:15.519 --> 00:37:16.718
Will she be okay?

00:37:16.718 --> 00:37:18.278
- Kong Hou!
- Where are you?

00:37:18.278 --> 00:37:18.919
Louder!

00:37:19.319 --> 00:37:20.319
- Kong Hou!
- Kong Hou!

00:37:20.519 --> 00:37:20.919
Tan Feng.

00:37:21.278 --> 00:37:22.238
Kong Hou.

00:37:24.718 --> 00:37:26.158
Are you okay? Where did you go?

00:37:26.439 --> 00:37:27.959
I may have been harsh,

00:37:28.198 --> 00:37:29.439
but you can't be so reckless.

00:37:29.598 --> 00:37:30.919
I was worried sick!

00:37:32.638 --> 00:37:34.399
Kong Hou, are you alright?

00:37:34.919 --> 00:37:35.718
I'm fine.

00:37:35.879 --> 00:37:37.078
Good.

00:37:37.118 --> 00:37:38.198
After you left,

00:37:38.198 --> 00:37:39.158
Senior Tan Feng

00:37:39.158 --> 00:37:40.319
almost lost his mind.

00:37:42.118 --> 00:37:43.399
I-I didn't.

00:37:43.598 --> 00:37:44.558
Not at all.

00:37:44.839 --> 00:37:46.959
You don't seem happy.

00:37:47.198 --> 00:37:47.879
I know

00:37:47.879 --> 00:37:49.479
undercover work

00:37:49.479 --> 00:37:51.198
has you tired and hungry.

00:37:51.519 --> 00:37:53.118
Back at Yunhua Sect,

00:37:53.118 --> 00:37:54.519
whenever you were upset,

00:37:54.519 --> 00:37:55.799
you'd get constipated.

00:37:56.078 --> 00:37:56.999
So I figured

00:37:57.078 --> 00:37:59.078
this time was no different.

00:37:59.158 --> 00:38:01.078
That's why you were being difficult.

00:38:01.078 --> 00:38:01.638
I bought

00:38:01.638 --> 00:38:02.479
some laxative

00:38:02.479 --> 00:38:03.598
spiritual fruits.

00:38:03.919 --> 00:38:04.319
Here.

00:38:05.519 --> 00:38:06.359
Interesting.

00:38:06.678 --> 00:38:07.558
In the same sect,

00:38:07.598 --> 00:38:09.248
one constipated, and one with diarrhea.

00:38:10.678 --> 00:38:11.439
Tan Feng.

00:38:11.758 --> 00:38:13.439
Don't be mad.

00:38:13.479 --> 00:38:15.359
Your chest is glowing.

00:38:15.959 --> 00:38:18.238
Are you going to explode?

00:38:18.238 --> 00:38:19.359
Exploding?

00:38:19.399 --> 00:38:20.758
This is a tracking jade pendant.

00:38:20.879 --> 00:38:22.118
It glows if a tracking talisman

00:38:22.118 --> 00:38:22.999
is activated.

00:38:24.039 --> 00:38:24.519
