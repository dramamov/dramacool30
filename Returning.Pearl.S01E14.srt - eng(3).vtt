WEBVTT

00:01:16.504 --> 00:01:18.224
What kind of person are you?

00:01:22.269 --> 00:01:23.714
You are so strange

00:01:28.438 --> 00:01:29.599
You are so unreal

00:01:30.454 --> 00:01:31.770
but i am real

00:01:34.757 --> 00:01:35.910
can you believe me

00:01:36.698 --> 00:01:37.523
Adult Kei

00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:43.239
You saved my life

00:01:45.311 --> 00:01:47.092
Why don't I believe you?

00:02:07.791 --> 00:02:08.413
I

00:02:08.643 --> 00:02:11.154
From a future more than two hundred years in the future

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:12.379
Back in time

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.330
When I first came here

00:02:14.355 --> 00:02:16.420
I was thinking about how I should go back

00:02:17.735 --> 00:02:18.735
so

00:02:19.461 --> 00:02:21.741
That's why I often use you

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:26.376
What a future more than two hundred years from now

00:02:29.206 --> 00:02:30.107
because of it

00:02:30.826 --> 00:02:34.306
gave birth to something that fascinates me so much

00:02:36.284 --> 00:02:37.483
Lin Suisui

00:02:45.838 --> 00:02:47.118
This is you

00:02:49.013 --> 00:02:50.023
Jingyuan

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.367
Although you are a paper person

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.005
But you make me feel bad

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:03.389
It also makes me excited

00:03:07.836 --> 00:03:09.617
I can't bear to part with you

00:03:11.908 --> 00:03:13.869
I can't bear to leave here

00:03:16.681 --> 00:03:18.192
Can't bear to leave you

00:04:41.166 --> 00:04:41.806
Jingyuan

00:04:42.092 --> 00:04:44.207
Why is your neck always crooked?

00:04:45.476 --> 00:04:46.373
I

00:04:47.324 --> 00:04:48.245
last night

00:04:48.333 --> 00:04:49.413
A little stiff

00:04:50.055 --> 00:04:50.904
oh

00:04:51.187 --> 00:04:52.187
What did I say?

00:04:52.611 --> 00:04:54.482
Why does the magpie keep calling this morning?

00:04:54.767 --> 00:04:57.128
It turns out that someone used their neck to draw a magpie bridge.

00:04:59.007 --> 00:04:59.795
Lin'er

00:05:00.838 --> 00:05:01.542
What's wrong

00:05:02.208 --> 00:05:03.489
Why are you so weird?

00:05:04.314 --> 00:05:05.115
What are you laughing at?

00:05:05.311 --> 00:05:05.951
I

00:05:06.711 --> 00:05:07.711
did i laugh

00:05:08.002 --> 00:05:09.442
Are you smiling?

00:05:12.007 --> 00:05:13.651
candied haws

00:05:13.676 --> 00:05:14.760
Do you eat candied haws?

00:05:15.107 --> 00:05:16.167
candied haws

00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:16.773
Um

00:05:16.874 --> 00:05:17.745
Do you want to eat it?

00:05:18.093 --> 00:05:19.014
Do you want to eat little swallows?

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:19.598
Yes, I want to eat

00:05:19.623 --> 00:05:20.410
Do you want to eat candied haws?

00:05:20.435 --> 00:05:21.223
I'm going to buy it now

00:05:21.826 --> 00:05:22.506
Jingyuan

00:05:22.923 --> 00:05:25.289
This candied haws on a stick comes from our capital city

00:05:25.396 --> 00:05:26.656
What do you eat when you come to Yangzhou?

00:05:27.282 --> 00:05:28.917
Beijing has the taste of Beijing

00:05:28.942 --> 00:05:29.663
And what about Yangzhou?

00:05:29.688 --> 00:05:30.792
It has the taste of Yangzhou

00:05:30.817 --> 00:05:31.817
different mood

00:05:31.842 --> 00:05:33.117
The taste is naturally different

00:05:34.454 --> 00:05:35.467
oh

00:05:35.492 --> 00:05:36.310
Gotta try it

00:05:37.163 --> 00:05:38.101
Gotta try it

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:39.979
wait for me

00:05:43.477 --> 00:05:46.236
The drunkard's intention is not to drink.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.120
What kind of wine did you say?

00:05:50.166 --> 00:05:50.898
Is it tasty

00:05:52.734 --> 00:05:53.839
This candied haws on a stick is quite delicious.

00:05:53.864 --> 00:05:54.907
Well, you won’t eat it

00:06:01.666 --> 00:06:03.786
I specially left the biggest one for you.

00:06:14.458 --> 00:06:15.607
Lakeside at night

00:06:15.805 --> 00:06:16.692
See you or leave

00:06:16.924 --> 00:06:17.632
Um

00:06:19.304 --> 00:06:20.151
little swallow

00:06:20.176 --> 00:06:20.898
Let's go

00:06:20.962 --> 00:06:22.139
Ziwei is in front

00:06:27.528 --> 00:06:29.637
This candied haws hasn’t even entered my mouth yet.

00:06:30.001 --> 00:06:31.045
You smile so sweetly

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:35.017
It looks sweet to me

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:36.029
feel happy

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:02.898
Jingyuan

00:07:07.636 --> 00:07:08.636
You can't sleep either

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:11.217
emperor

00:07:11.915 --> 00:07:12.976
Greet the emperor

00:07:13.118 --> 00:07:14.070
Um

00:07:15.108 --> 00:07:17.157
Look, the night is beautiful

00:07:17.182 --> 00:07:19.703
I can't help but want to recite a poem

00:07:22.448 --> 00:07:24.867
Where should the pan-moon be?

00:07:25.654 --> 00:07:28.460
Villa view latest

00:07:37.743 --> 00:07:38.743
one

00:07:45.524 --> 00:07:46.524
one

00:07:49.633 --> 00:07:52.089
Xiaxiao is refreshing

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:54.795
The water is flowing brightly

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:55.923
How about it

00:07:56.191 --> 00:07:56.895
good poem

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.142
The emperor has profound knowledge

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:02.869
Tonight, poetry is booming

00:08:02.894 --> 00:08:04.320
I want to compose another poem

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:06.854
Let’s enjoy the bright moon with His Majesty

00:08:07.326 --> 00:08:09.406
I am lucky in my three lives

00:08:09.721 --> 00:08:11.192
It's just that it's too late today

00:08:11.636 --> 00:08:13.325
Please take care of your dragon body, Your Majesty

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:14.879
Just go to bed early

00:08:19.709 --> 00:08:21.092
How many nights without moon

00:08:21.549 --> 00:08:23.392
There is no bamboo or cypress anywhere

00:08:24.052 --> 00:08:25.420
But few idlers

00:08:25.584 --> 00:08:27.667
Like the two of us

00:08:28.233 --> 00:08:29.585
But I think

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:34.014
This Su University scholar should be less of a kind of idler.

00:08:36.003 --> 00:08:37.482
Please make it clear, Your Majesty

00:08:38.488 --> 00:08:40.287
The idler who climbed over the wall

00:08:40.597 --> 00:08:41.442
emperor

00:08:44.335 --> 00:08:45.126
Get up quickly

00:08:45.151 --> 00:08:46.698
Don't ruin this great feeling

00:08:46.723 --> 00:08:47.479
Go get busy

00:08:48.147 --> 00:08:48.914
yes

00:08:56.361 --> 00:08:57.070
Where are you going?

00:09:00.771 --> 00:09:01.412
I

00:09:01.437 --> 00:09:03.873
What are you kid doing?

00:09:03.898 --> 00:09:07.570
Didn't I just say it's too late today?

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:13.742
I'm tired

00:09:17.516 --> 00:09:18.429
Thank you, Your Majesty

00:09:26.606 --> 00:09:27.263
every year

00:09:30.703 --> 00:09:31.395
every year

00:09:39.644 --> 00:09:40.725
I'm late

00:09:41.649 --> 00:09:42.967
She won't be angry anymore, right?

00:09:43.753 --> 00:09:45.513
How do I tell her about this?

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:13.388
surprise

00:10:14.269 --> 00:10:14.976
What are you thinking about?

00:10:15.485 --> 00:10:16.526
I'm just thinking

00:10:17.207 --> 00:10:18.366
someone in the air

00:10:18.817 --> 00:10:21.191
I must have never seen so many fireflies

00:10:21.361 --> 00:10:23.095
I just wanted to give you a surprise

00:10:23.434 --> 00:10:24.129
Awesome

00:10:24.229 --> 00:10:25.320
who knows

00:10:25.345 --> 00:10:27.663
It's someone who is so late

00:10:28.102 --> 00:10:30.223
I got bitten by mosquitoes a lot

00:10:30.763 --> 00:10:31.924
Let me see, let me see

00:10:35.914 --> 00:10:37.113
In fact, I should have arrived a long time ago

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.426
It was just a coincidence that the emperor became very popular in poetry.

00:10:39.451 --> 00:10:41.520
I had to listen to him reciting poems and composing poems

00:10:41.724 --> 00:10:43.207
So there was some delay on the way

00:10:43.232 --> 00:10:45.185
It turns out that I really love writing poetry so much.

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:47.249
I thought it was made up by unofficial historians.

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:49.885
The Holy Father is busy with state affairs on weekdays

00:10:49.968 --> 00:10:50.762
Taking care of everything

00:10:50.803 --> 00:10:52.004
It's rare to relax

00:10:52.608 --> 00:10:53.579
as a subject

00:10:53.604 --> 00:10:55.382
Being able to be by his side at this moment

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:56.960
It's also my honor

00:10:59.456 --> 00:11:01.056
When you mention the emperor

00:11:01.278 --> 00:11:03.013
Your eyes are shining

00:11:03.722 --> 00:11:04.582
Adult Kei

00:11:05.163 --> 00:11:06.523
You admire him very much, right?

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:10.057
every year

00:11:13.551 --> 00:11:14.751
After returning to Beijing this time

00:11:14.964 --> 00:11:15.673
Um

00:11:16.163 --> 00:11:18.642
I plan to ask the emperor for marriage

00:11:20.166 --> 00:11:21.607
With the emperor's blessing

00:11:21.805 --> 00:11:23.760
Presumably the Queen will not object too much

00:11:27.554 --> 00:11:28.835
two of us

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.164
Even if there is no objection from the queen

00:11:35.431 --> 00:11:36.623
The road ahead

00:11:37.674 --> 00:11:39.113
It will also be very difficult

00:11:40.573 --> 00:11:41.557
It's difficult

00:11:42.784 --> 00:11:44.901
What hasn't been difficult for you and me since we met?

00:11:45.544 --> 00:11:46.863
But haven’t we all done it?

00:11:49.852 --> 00:11:51.173
But in my opinion

00:11:51.876 --> 00:11:54.116
You do have one thing left unfinished

00:11:55.771 --> 00:11:56.411
rest assured

00:11:56.683 --> 00:11:57.883
Wait until we get engaged

00:11:58.797 --> 00:12:00.445
I'll accompany you back to your hometown to see

00:12:00.812 --> 00:12:02.935
Chaoyang District, Beijing

00:12:03.459 --> 00:12:04.245
I remember it all

00:12:08.946 --> 00:12:11.704
If the plot keeps developing like this smoothly

00:12:12.444 --> 00:12:14.843
Will I eventually return to the real world?

00:12:16.267 --> 00:12:17.598
What should Jing Yuan do?
