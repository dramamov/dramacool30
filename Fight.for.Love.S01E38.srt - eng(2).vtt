Great news.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.200
Consort of Mei is with child.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:49.430
She's with child?

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.040
Changming,

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:58.790
you're carrying my child.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:00.630
Tell me.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.080
Am I dreaming?

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.430
Of course not.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.230
Child...

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.510
I didn't expect this either.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.070
Good. Good.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.040
Whatever medicine you need,

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.230
just let me know.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.110
I'll spare no expense.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.510
As long as you make her

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:21.350
have a safe delivery,

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:22.390
you'll be rewarded.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.640
Thanks, Your Majesty.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.920
I'll go prepare the medicine

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.160
for Her Grace.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.060
Your Highness.

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.220
Are you sure she's pregnant?

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.780
If your diagnosis is wrong,

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:35.700
I will not spare you.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.380
Your Highness,

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.940
I'm sure about that.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.380
Her Grace has difficulty conceiving.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.260
This is truly a heaven-sent gift.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.260
But her constitution is rather weak.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.500
She must be very cautious.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.140
She won't be out of danger

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:51.940
until her pregnancy is more stable.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.220
You cannot keep the child.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:02.620
Why?

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.220
You wouldn't have said such a thing

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.900
if it were Noble Consort Chen's child.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.300
Because I am not from North Qi.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.260
So, the child I'm carrying

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:18.420
is illegitimate.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.900
It can't live.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.060
I don't think of it like that.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.460
Mother, after you gave birth to me,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.980
I was called "illegitimate child".

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.540
Now, I'm the King of North Qi.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.780
How could I let my child

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.340
suffer the same thing?

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:52.540
From now on,

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.860
you and the child

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.140
are my everything.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.260
If it's a boy,

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.460
he will be the Crown Prince.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.020
If it's a girl,

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.500
she will be

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:04.540
the happiest princess.

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:06.580
Changming,

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.980
whatever you want,

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:09.500
I will grant it.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.020
How dare you!

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.580
Who's breaking in here?

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:17.800
Don't let that noise

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:18.660
disturb her.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.940
(Bright and Virtuous)

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:33.820
Without my permission,

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.660
how could anyone break in?

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.380
Kill that assassin.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.200
- Yes.
- Stop.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.260
Yue,

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.100
do you really not know who is out there?

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:51.860
Her Highness fainted.

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.700
As the envoy,

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.540
can't I come to see her?

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.140
You know it's Chu Yu,

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.100
the envoy from Great Sui.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:04.900
No matter what your reason is,

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.780
as long as she dies in our palace,

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.180
it won't do good to our nation.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.300
What if she were to die outside?

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.220
That assassin impersonated an envoy

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.140
to sabotage the peace talks.

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.060
She must have evil intentions.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:21.260
Kill her.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.020
What are you waiting for?

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.620
You must kill her

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:26.660
at whatever cost!

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.100
Yes.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.940
You...

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:30.500
Do you really not want

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.420
your throne anymore?

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.460
Sorry, but I must attend to my consort

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:38.580
and your grandchild.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.620
I won't be seeing you out, Mother.

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.980
You...

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:13.980
Kill!

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:26.260
You want to kill me here

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:27.100
for no reason.

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:28.700
Zhao Yue,

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:30.500
you will not get what you want.

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:44.660
In the middle of the night,

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:46.940
you hunt our envoys.

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:48.620
You have some nerve.

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:50.380
Count me in.

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.100
I'll kill you all.

00:07:58.180 --> 00:07:59.020
Don't fight.

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:00.900
Her Highness ordered

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.100
the delegation be protected.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.340
Nobody is allowed to fight here.

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.580
(Queen Mother's Order)

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:10.480
- Let's go.
- Go.

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:19.020
Why are you two here?

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:21.340
We heard there was an assassin.

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:22.460
We thought Zhao Yue

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:23.300
would kill you.

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:24.740
So, we came out for you.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:26.660
Luckily, we found you here.

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:30.220
Ms. Chu,

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:32.180
you're way too charming.

00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:34.220
Your pursuer

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:35.460
came all the way here for you.

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:37.140
He's quite determined.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:41.540
Shut up.

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:43.980
Let's go back there.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:54.540
Come on.

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:01.180
That was a fierce fight.

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:03.260
I didn't make a move.

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:05.230
- Let's go.
- Alright.

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:16.020
Don't look at me.

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:17.140
I don't know why he came.

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:23.500
Yun,

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:25.220
weren't you confined
in the Arsenal Bureau?

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:27.100
Why are you here?

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.420
I had my means.

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:39.940
Zhao Yue is cunning.

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:44.140
This journey must be full of dangers.

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:46.540
A big shot like you has come here.

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:48.820
Wouldn't it be more dangerous?

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:51.980
The locals have only heard of my name.

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:53.780
Few of them have seen me.

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:55.620
Even if they have my portrait,

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:56.980
they might not recognize me.

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:58.140
Fine, then.

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:00.220
So, Yun,

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:01.700
you're back on the team.

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:03.500
Gongsun Lan helped me sneak in.

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:06.260
So, Gongsun Lan

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:08.180
is your agent in North Qi.

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:12.380
- He's one of us?
- He's one of us?

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:15.740
As the deputy commander

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:16.980
of the Arsenal Bureau,

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:18.260
it's time that you knew

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:20.140
the exact location

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:21.500
of the long-hidden 6th Division.

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:22.820
He...

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:24.860
That man

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:26.740
is quite believable.

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:29.300
When a deputy commander like me

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:30.160
met him,

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:31.420
he acted arrogantly

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:32.620
as if he didn't know me.

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:34.540
But it turns out he's one of us.

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:36.100
He's believable enough.

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:37.700
So far, he has infiltrated

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:38.700
into the royal court.

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:39.860
When necessary,

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:41.730
he will be

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:42.780
our most powerful ally.

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:45.460
Did he tell you something else?

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:48.980
You probably realized that as well.

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:50.860
Yunyang and Zhao Yue

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:52.820
appear to get along well.

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:55.100
But in reality,
they don't trust each other.

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:59.140
I understand that Zhao Yue
doesn't want peace talks.

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:00.820
But today, two things

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:01.860
were very strange.

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:03.660
First,

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:05.740
Her Highness requested
to become a consort.

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:06.860
Second,

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:07.980
I was assassinated

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:09.380
right on the street.

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:18.300
We'll have to wait and see.

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:20.460
I told Gongsun Lan

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:22.420
to keep an eye on Her Highness.

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:25.700
Luckily, Yunyang wants peace talks.

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:27.460
So, we can be safe

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:29.140
in the posthouse.

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:32.340
So, are you going back

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:34.620
to Mr. Gongsun's place?

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:38.140
Yeah.

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:39.900
Tonight,

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:42.380
are you going back there?

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:36.860
Aren't you tired?

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:41.140
Don't want me to get in?

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:44.700
Walls have ears.

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:46.340
We're in Qizhou, after all.

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:48.300
Tonight,

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:49.500
there's no way

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:50.340
I could live here.

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:52.500
I must go back to Mr. Gongsun's place.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:12:59.620
You want me to stay?

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:00.700
Of course not.

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:05.900
I'll see you out.

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:15.780
(Zhonggong Gate, Qi)

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:27.740
(Yifen Hall)

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:41.660
(Chengtian Hall, Qi)

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:46.060
(Bright and Virtuous)

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:56.500
Your Highness,

00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:57.700
these are rewards

00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:58.900
from His Majesty.

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:00.220
And the gifts

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:01.100
from the City Lords.

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:03.460
His Majesty almost emptied

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:04.300
the palace treasury.

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:09.780
The King is here.

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:23.140
Your Highness,

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:24.900
you should bow to His Majesty.

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:26.860
She is with child.

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:27.980
From now on,

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:28.980
she doesn't need

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:30.180
to bow to anyone.

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:31.660
Get out, all of you.

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:42.900
Changming,

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:44.980
how do you feel today?

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:48.940
I saw that.

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:50.460
You sent away the gifts

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:51.340
from the City Lords

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:52.580
and from me.

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:54.780
Do you not like them?

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.860
Now, I'm Consort of Mei

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:03.780
and I'm carrying your first child.

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:05.820
Do you

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:08.060
and the City Lords think

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:09.380
I only deserve

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:11.660
these poor things?

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:17.300
But these are

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:18.980
the best things in North Qi.

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:22.460
Even one single pearl from my brother

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:27.340
is worth all these jewels.

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:29.420
The City Lords may not know.

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:31.020
What about you?

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:34.420
Is it that you don't respect me

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:38.660
or is it that your subjects

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:39.820
don't respect you?

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:44.700
If you don't like these gifts,

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:46.580
I'll have them thrown away.

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:48.140
What do you want?

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:49.660
I'll have the nation searched

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:50.740
to get it for you.

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:52.300
Really?

00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:59.020
I want to be the queen of North Qi.

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:00.980
Can you make me that?

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:07.420
Never mind.

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:10.020
I don't want to push you.

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:11.820
After all, the Queen Mother

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:13.580
is in charge of the nation.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:16.100
Changming,

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:17.620
trust me.

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:19.980
No one but you will be my queen.

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:21.900
Give me a little more time.

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:24.100
Alright.

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:25.420
I'll give you some time.

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.220
Currently,

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:30.380
you can't make me the Queen.

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:33.060
So, you should make me

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:35.460
an agate coronet symbolizing the status

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:36.700
of the Queen.

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:38.260
Can you do that?

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:40.860
That's easy.

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:43.620
Even if you want the moon,

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:44.860
I will find a way

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:45.700
to get it for you.

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:47.860
Tomorrow, I'll issue notices

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:48.700
throughout the city.

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:49.860
I'll ask everyone

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:51.380
to find the best agate

00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:52.220
for you.

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:01.900
I've heard

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:03.460
a pregnant woman

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:05.700
will always have fair skin

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:08.260
if she takes a milk bath every day.

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:12.780
From now on, I want the best milk

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:14.740
for my bath every night.

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:16.420
Can you grant me this?

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:18.980
I will grant you

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:20.740
anything you wish for.

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:37.400
Wontons.

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:40.220
Hot wontons.

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:46.180
(Notice: Consort of Mei is with child.
The King wants agate for her.)

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:47.060
What is this?

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:49.820
Consort of Mei.

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:50.940
It's her again.

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:53.500
Why is it her again?

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:55.860
What does it say? Let's go and see.

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:57.100
Imperial notice?

00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:58.860
It says the King requests agate

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:00.940
for Consort of Mei.

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:02.940
How could common people have that?

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:03.780
Yeah.

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:04.940
There's a reward.

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:06.380
Do you have any?

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:07.300
Not at all.

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:08.140
Let's go, then.

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:09.140
Come on.

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:12.980
What? Her Highness is with child?

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:15.140
(Qizhou Posthouse)

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:16.820
So, that day,

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:18.780
Her Highness didn't faint on purpose.

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:21.940
Her Highness is with child.

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:23.100
We should

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:24.660
take her back home even sooner.

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:27.460
Today, people on the street

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:28.420
all cursed Her Highness.

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:30.060
If she gives birth

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:30.900
to Zhao Yue's child,

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:33.140
let alone in North Qi,

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:35.540
there will be no place
for her even in Great Sui.

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:37.180
What about my tea?

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:38.940
Get some yourself.

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:40.020
What?

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:42.980
Her Highness isn't

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:44.260
extravagant or self-indulgent.

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:45.660
Something's fishy.

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:48.020
Earlier, I sent Gongsun Lan

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:48.980
to see Her Highness

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:50.660
and enlist her help from within.

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:53.100
I think the request for agate

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:55.420
was a guise used by Her Highness.

00:18:57.740 --> 00:18:58.820
But anyway,

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:00.420
where can we find some agate?

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:02.900
Yun City is close to mountains
and rich in gemstones.

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:05.900
I'm afraid this is why Her Highness

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:07.580
asked for some agate.

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:11.380
She's clever, indeed.

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:13.180
You got it.

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:20.220
Well, that's decided.

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:21.580
Zhao Yue must have had

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:22.420
his men watch us.

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:23.540
Then, we'll split up.

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:25.020
Later, let's meet at Qiyang Shop.

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:28.380
Come on.

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:43.540
I miss Jin.

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:46.660
I miss Mingliu, too.

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:48.100
Stop this useless talk.

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:48.940
Move now.

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:02.460
When you came,

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:03.340
did anyone stalk you?

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:04.980
The two of us

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:05.860
are shrewd enough.

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:07.380
We shook the stalkers off.

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:18.180
Master is waiting inside.

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:19.860
Come in, please.

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:25.500
There you go.

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:32.300
Your Lord...

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:35.300
Sit, please.

00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:37.820
Impressive, sir.

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:39.580
I didn't expect

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:41.380
to see such a big secret room

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:42.820
back here.

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:46.780
You're so good at faking, Mr. Gongsun.

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:48.180
As we met the other day,

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:49.240
you pretended you didn't know us.

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:52.540
I live in this country,

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:54.180
so I have to keep a low profile.

00:20:57.060 --> 00:20:57.940
Ms. Chu,

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:00.340
it's what you wanted.

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:03.900
Thank you.

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:05.780
I want to take Her Highness away.

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:08.100
As far as you know about Zhao Yue,

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:08.940
what are our chances?

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:13.420
Let me be frank.

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:16.820
Zhao Yue is a romantic.

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:19.740
Before he's dethroned,

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:21.860
you want to take Her Highness away...

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:24.220
Absolutely impossible.

00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:25.780
What if I insist?

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:35.180
If the Queen Mother helps...

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:38.220
A fifty percent chance.

00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:43.820
Thank you, sir.

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:45.460
We'll take care of the rest.

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:52.740
(Zhonggong Gate)

00:21:58.700 --> 00:21:59.580
Your Highness,

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:00.780
here are all the gifts

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:02.140
from other consorts.

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:18.100
They really can't wait.

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:21.180
The King is here.

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:26.140
Glad they're sensible.

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:28.820
What do you think?

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:29.860
Anything you like?

00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:32.220
Your consorts

00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:33.900
gave more thought to the gifts

00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:35.420
than the City Lords.

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:38.020
I'm somewhat satisfied.

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:39.660
Good.

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:41.180
You asked for some milk.

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:43.140
I've had it poured in the bathing pool.

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:44.300
You can bathe tonight.

00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:47.460
I've heard

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:49.820
the people have been complaining

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:51.540
about the milk I want.

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:53.580
You don't mind?

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:57.860
My subjects should take my orders.

00:22:58.300 --> 00:22:59.140
Besides,

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:00.620
it's their honor

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:01.940
to give you their milk.

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:03.780
Like I said,

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:05.060
no matter what you want,

00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:06.260
I will get it for you.

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:09.060
Changming,

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:10.300
come and see.

00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:27.220
This is the agate

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:28.660
you wished for.

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:30.340
Take a look.

00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:31.860
(Emerald)
Anything you like?

00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:35.100
(Pink Jade)

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:39.020
(Ruby)

00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:46.100
Can't you find

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:48.660
one single piece of nice agate

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:49.820
in this state?

00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:54.300
Zhao Yue,

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:56.300
look at the quality

00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:57.420
of the agate they offered.

00:23:58.340 --> 00:23:59.860
They're actually fooling me.

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:01.580
Do I not

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:02.780
deserve the best agate

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:05.580
just because I'm not the Queen?

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:14.340
Don't be angry, Changming.

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:16.260
If you don't like any of them,

00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:17.780
I'll have my men look for more.

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:21.260
If you get sick from anger

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:22.940
and harm the child,

00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:24.180
it would be bad.

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:31.500
(Come on, Chu Yu.)

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:34.460
(Don't let me down.)

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:38.100
(Envoy's Token)
We're envoys of Great Sui.

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:39.460
We present a treasure.

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:41.340
His Majesty ordered

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:42.820
the envoys shouldn't get in

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:43.940
unless summoned.

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:45.820
So, you've been prepared.

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:47.740
You don't want us to get in.

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:49.060
Please take a message.

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:51.460
We won't see the King or Consort of Mei,

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:53.060
but the Queen Mother.

00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:54.780
In this box

00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:55.940
is the best agate.

00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:57.260
And it's for

00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:59.220
the most noble Mother Queen.

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:03.940
Will you reject us when we want

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:05.340
to offer a treasure?

00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:06.260
During peace talks,

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:08.140
if you shut out

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:08.980
the envoys

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:10.180
and the news gets out...

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:11.580
From a small point,

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:13.340
you're provoking us.

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:14.740
From a big point,

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:16.980
you'll start another war.

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:18.660
Are you able to bear

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:19.860
the consequences?

00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:24.860
Go inform the Queen Mother.

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:42.660
Her Highness summoned

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:43.980
the envoys for an audience.

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:45.060
Come with me, then.

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:00.740
Why did you

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:02.020
requested an audience?

00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:04.660
To preserve the peace of North Qi.

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:09.300
I'd like to see

00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:11.180
how a woman from Great Sui

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:14.060
can preserve the peace of my nation.

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:16.340
The King ascended the throne

00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:17.740
and issued the first notice,

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:19.530
asking all his people

00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:20.890
to find a mere piece of agate.

00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:33.140
And he asked his people

00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:34.220
to offer the best milk

00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:35.460
to the royal palace.

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:37.060
When exploited like this,

00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:38.180
the people suffered badly.

00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:39.380
And he did all this

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:40.980
just to amuse Consort of Mei.

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:54.580
Yeah, Your Highness.

00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:56.460
You should think carefully.

00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:58.980
If Consort of Mei remains here,

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:00.340
how can your precious son

00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:01.580
rule this country properly?

00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:05.310
Then North Qi will

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:06.700
fall into great chaos.

00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:08.020
How dare you!

00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:15.460
My son has just become the King

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:16.620
and he's still young.

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:19.180
If Li Changming weren't bewitching him,

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:21.220
he wouldn't neglect his duties.

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:22.980
It's all her fault.

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:24.540
She egged my son on

00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:25.660
to do these absurd things.

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:28.340
You must be aware
of the current situation.

00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:30.740
If Consort of Mei gives birth to a son,

00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:33.060
he will be the Crown Prince immediately.

00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:34.980
Then, I'm afraid

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:36.300
you can't turn things around.

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:38.780
If you let us take her away,

00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:41.340
the King will focus on his duties

00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:43.460
and you will be relieved.

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:51.900
Say what you have to say.

00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:54.660
If you let us take her away,

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:56.180
we promise

00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:58.380
we'll keep a good-neighborly friendship

00:27:58.660 --> 00:27:59.500
and start no war.

00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:03.060
That's all?

00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:05.300
North Qi lost two battles

00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:07.340
while our troops are in high spirits.

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:08.780
If a war breaks out again,

00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:09.980
your people won't bear

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:11.460
the suffering of war.

00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:15.660
Besides,

00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:17.140
if someone makes trouble

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:18.740
from inside your court,

00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:21.180
North Qi will never be peaceful again.

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:22.740
All this relies

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:24.900
on your decision.

00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:37.620
Alright.

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:41.180
I agree.

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:46.700
Then, Your Highness,

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:47.940
I should see Consort of Mei

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:49.260
to proceed with this.

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:51.580
You must see her alone.

00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:54.020
Thank you.

00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:05.420
People get together

00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:06.940
in pursuit of gain.

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:08.420
This is also why people

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:10.740
fall apart.

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:13.100
Cooperate?

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:19.780
Until this evil woman is dead,

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:22.540
there will never be peace in our nation.

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:26.020
Have your men stand by.

00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:28.460
Once they leave North Qi,

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:31.220
find a chance to kill that woman.

00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:33.140
By then,

00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:35.860
she will have been killed
on their watch.

00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:37.620
It has nothing to do

00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:39.540
with our nation.

00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:41.820
Yes.

00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:55.660
Your Highness.

00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:57.220
Chu Yu?

00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:58.060
Your Highness.

00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:04.020
Chu Yu,

00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:06.060
how did you get in here?

00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:09.300
Why are you alone?

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:11.700
Song Wenchang and Lu Qiba

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:12.540
are also here.

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:14.940
I managed to see Queen Mother Yunyang

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:16.100
for the sake of agate.

00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:18.140
I knew

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:19.220
you would come.

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:21.620
I've persuaded Queen Mother Yunyang.

00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:22.820
She will help us

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:24.340
to take you away from here.

00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:27.260
I can't go back.

00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:29.380
Why?

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:33.620
I'm with child.

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:35.220
I should take advantage of it.

00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:36.700
When I stay here,

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:38.100
I can not only restrain Zhao Yue

00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:39.340
but also cooperate with you

00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:40.900
from within.

00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:42.540
North Qi is like a quagmire.

00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:44.100
The longer you stay,

00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:45.020
the more danger there is.

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:46.740
As long as you get away,

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:47.740
any plan

00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:48.740
can be reconsidered.

00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:51.980
I know you care about me.

00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:54.540
Now, Zhao Yue has a problem

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:55.660
with Queen Mother Yunyang.

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:57.420
But he's the King of North Qi.

00:30:58.380 --> 00:30:59.420
If you take me away,

00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:01.180
you'll be against a country

00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:02.020
all by yourself.

00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:03.740
It's not that easy

00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:05.020
in this foreign land.

00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:07.820
I'm helping you

00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:09.220
and also helping myself.

00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:15.500
Very well.

00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:17.260
I know it's hard

00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:19.500
to change your mind.

00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:21.300
I also have faith

00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:22.900
in your judgment and ability.

00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:25.580
But His Majesty is waiting for you.

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:28.420
Please take good care of yourself.

00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:31.980
I will kill Zhao Yue myself

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:34.020
to apologize to those people

00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:34.860
he had killed.

00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:36.780
Before that,

00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:39.460
I will take good care of myself.

00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:41.980
I'm waiting for the day

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:45.020
when I return to Great Sui with you.

00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:53.820
Go back and don't worry.

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:05.340
Take care.

00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:31.100
I will answer for the harmful outcomes

00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:35.140
from my relationship with Zhao Yue.

00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:38.620
You don't need

00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:40.940
to suffer

00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:41.780
in this bitter world.

00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:46.100
Chu Yu,

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:49.460
I will not be returning with you.

00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:53.260
You and I won't meet again

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:56.460
until Zhao Yue is dead.

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:15.420
Your Majesty,

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:17.220
our guard reported something.

00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:19.340
The delegation visited the Queen Mother

00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:20.580
with a box of agate.

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:23.380
They stayed in her palace

00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:25.420
for about one hour.

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:27.580
Her Highness even had them escorted

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:29.100
to Consort of Mei's palace.

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:31.820
Queen Mother. It's her again.

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:34.220
I endured her ruling beside me.

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:36.380
I also endured my forced marriage.

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:38.740
A mother like her doesn't love me,

00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:39.940
and she wants my child

00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:40.820
to lose its mother.

00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:42.900
And Chu Yu...

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:45.780
How dare you try to take Changming away?

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:48.460
Since you have a death wish,

00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:50.140
I will grant it.

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:52.940
Give out my order.

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:54.380
All the imperial guards

00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:55.940
go with me to intercept them.

00:33:56.110 --> 00:33:56.980
Yes.

00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:57.820
Send another team

00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:00.340
to besiege the Queen Mother's palace.

00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:02.100
Without my permission,

00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:03.820
no one can get in or out.

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:05.940
But Your Majesty...

00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:07.100
She and the delegation

00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:07.940
have secret dealings.

00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:09.020
This is treason.

00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:10.540
Anyone who speaks for her

00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:11.380
is an accomplice.

00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:12.540
Get out of here now!

00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:13.940
Yes.

00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:52.540
Get out of my way.

00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:53.540
Sorry, Your Highness.

00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:54.820
It's the King's order.

00:34:55.140 --> 00:34:56.420
No matter what happens tonight,

00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:58.420
Your Highness must not leave the palace.

00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:00.620
If I insist on going out,

00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:02.380
what will you do?

00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:12.860
How dare you!

00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:15.020
You're defying me.

00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:16.580
So hungry to die?

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:17.940
Get out of my way.

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:19.220
I wouldn't dare.

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:20.540
But I also must not

00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:21.980
violate the King's order.

00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:23.620
His Majesty said,

00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:24.740
he would

00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:26.220
explain to you the next day.

00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:28.380
Your Highness, it's late.

00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:29.700
Go have a good rest.

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:37.140
You go fetch

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:39.020
the tonic from Noble Consort Chen.

00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:40.820
I'll drink it and go to bed.

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:44.020
Ask them to guard out there.

00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:45.420
I don't want to see them.

00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:48.660
Yes.

00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:56.060
Zhao Yue is actually trying
to kill them.

00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:58.260
After they talked to the Queen Mother,

00:35:58.620 --> 00:35:59.580
Zhao Yue would move.

00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:01.200
He and his mother

00:36:01.210 --> 00:36:02.400
won't be reconciled again.

00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:04.660
Mr. Gongsun,

00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:06.020
I want my spear and a horse.

00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:07.860
It's time I should move.

00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:09.220
Now?

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:11.260
Now.

00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:21.300
Yu, don't be afraid.

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:22.980
We will fight our way out.

00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:24.420
Chu Yu,

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:26.100
you will not take Changming away.

00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:27.980
Give up now.

00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:31.420
The Queen Mother made a deal with me.

00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:33.140
She has also agreed

00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:34.660
to our terms.

00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:36.300
I am the King of North Qi.

00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:38.940
You negotiated with my mother instead.

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:40.660
Whatever your agreement is,

00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:41.980
it will be invalid.

00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:43.380
Are you sure?

00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:44.900
But I think

00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:47.140
your mother knows more
about how to rule a nation.

00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:49.220
And she knows better
about how this nation

00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:50.060
should develop.

00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:51.100
Zhao Yue,

00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:53.260
you're an unworthy king.

00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:12.300
(Kangsheng Gate)

00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:13.820
Kill!

00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:15.060
Report!

00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:17.220
Your Majesty.

00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:18.940
A letter of challenge

00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:20.020
was shot at the palace gate.

00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:27.240
(Zhao Yue, you're too immoral
to be tolerated. I want to kill you.)

00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:30.500
(Do you dare to fight me? By Wei Yun)

00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:33.740
Wei Yun?

00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:37.820
Give out my order.

00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:39.980
Lock down Qizhou immediately.

00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:41.500
You guys,

00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:43.100
go out with me to see what's happening.

00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:44.660
The rest of you,

00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:46.980
kill all three of them here.

00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:48.260
Yes!

00:37:58.140 --> 00:37:59.940
You're a poisonous seed.

00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:02.580
You and Zhao Yue

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:05.900
could almost

00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:08.020
take my entire body

00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:09.620
and mind.

00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:18.900
I can imagine what you look like.

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:23.940
You must be

00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:25.300
a very good kid.

00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:29.060
Obedient

00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:31.580
and lovely.

00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:37.380
How I wish I could raise you.

00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:40.700
But Great Sui

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:43.020
matters the most to me.

00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:45.860
You came at the wrong time.

00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:50.460
I'm sorry.

00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:53.540
I can't let you live.

00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:06.060
In your next life,

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:09.460
remember to come find me.

00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:31.660
(Li Changming,)

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:33.780
(you must remember.)

00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:36.740
(What you're suffering now)

00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:39.420
(is the price for your past compassion.)

00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:42.860
(If I can save the people)

00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:45.100
(by getting rid of this bitter fruit,)

00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:47.700
(it will be my self-atonement.)

00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:54.980
