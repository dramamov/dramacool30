[Strange Tales of Tang Dynasty III:
To Chang'an]

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.979
[Episode 27]

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.229
The city is divided into two counties:

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.120
the eastern one called Wannian,
and the western one called Chang'an,

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.039
with Zhuque Avenue as the dividing line.

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:46.900
This design is truly ingenious.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.270
As for the Wannian County Sheriff Du Yu—

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:50.920
he doesn't know me well,

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.120
but I've heard much about him.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.310
Like Wei Tao,

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.920
he comes from a prominent family
in the capital.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.040
They both entered officialdom
through family privilege,

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.680
and each possesses notable talent.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.680
They're considered

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.140
two rising stars with unlimited potential.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.960
As nobles

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.470
born and raised in Chang'an,

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.190
not only had their families
worn court caps for generations,

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.590
but they're also the closet to
the Emperor.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.960
There's a local saying in Chang'an:

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.960
"south of the city live the Weis
and the Dus—only 5 feet from Heaven."

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:21.630
That I know.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.640
We've already witnessed

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.100
Wei Tao's methods of handling cases.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.079
But I wonder how this even younger

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.190
Du Yu's methods compare.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.590
You want to go to
the Wannian County Office

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.850
to see how he conducts trials, don't you?

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.470
But from what Du Yu said just now,

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.840
he was already hinting

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.230
that we overstepped our authority.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.850
If we go now,

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.030
won't it cause trouble for you,
Official Lu?

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.030
Don't try to use reverse psychology on me.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.000
Do I look like someone
who's afraid of trouble?

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.630
Besides,

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.280
the Du family of the capital
should be magnanimous.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.800
If we two go to observe,

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.590
Du Yu certainly won't mind.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.960
Sheriff Du.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.520
Could you please allow us

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.960
to take these things off our heads?

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:36.760
That won't do.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.450
These are crucial for the investigation.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.210
You, go over there

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:42.800
and draw out the positions

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.030
where each of you was standing
beneath the flame cloth

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.560
at the time of the incident.

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:46.470
Go now.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.630
Yes.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.960
Do you know Ma Kui?

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.100
I do,

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.490
[Integrity and Harmony]

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.840
but not very well.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.640
What do you mean by not very well?

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.460
We just exchange greetings when me meet
at most.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.400
So during today's deity procession,

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.590
did Ma Kui show any unusual behavior?

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:13.750
Not really.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.269
He seemed quite happy.

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:18.920
Even though this big sickle of mine

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.200
is made of wood,

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.040
it's still sharp enough

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.160
to kill someone.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.840
I specially had someone

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.750
make it from the finest wood.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.730
Check it out.

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.240
How could he not be happy?

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.950
He wasn't originally

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.680
part of the Seven-Saint Blade lineup
this month.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.600
He bought a spot at the last minute.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.240
He bought a spot? From whom?

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:41.490
Was it He Bi?

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.800
[The People Are the Foundation]

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.000
I only heard it from others.
I've said too much.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.070
No, no. This kind of talk is helpful.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:47.480
Let me ask you:

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.390
did Ma Kui

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.120
bribe the Zoroastrian Priest He Bi

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.270
to get this position?

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.720
Speak!

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.070
Actually, that wasn't the case.

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.680
He Bi

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.600
is one of the biggest merchants
in Chang'an.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.190
He wouldn't even consider
someone like Ma Kui.

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.510
Besides, the previous 7 people

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:59.800
had already been decided,

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.240
and they were all personally selected
by He Bi.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.600
Who would be willing to
give up their position

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.530
to someone else?

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.430
Then where did Ma Kui

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:08.440
spend his money?

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.880
I heard he went directly to
the High Priest.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.030
You mean Shi Qiansui?

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.510
Yes.

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.920
Ma Kui paid who-knows-how-much money

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:17.080
to get the High Priest
to speak on his behalf,

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.870
[Integrity and Harmony]

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.070
and that's how he secured the position.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:23.170
Anything else?

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.950
No.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.400
Go sign your statement.

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.240
I need to sign?

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.040
I was just repeating what I heard.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.500
I'm not even sure about it.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.159
You see that scribe?

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.590
He's not a fool.

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:35.920
When you say "I heard,"

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.180
he'll record it as hearsay. Understand?

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.000
Go now.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.070
Yes.

What's wrong with you?

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:49.190
Why do you look so worried?

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.730
What concerns me is,

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.300
now that Ma Kui is dead,

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.159
what will happen to his business?

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:55.220
In the East Market,

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.680
his pepper business

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.120
is the biggest right now.

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.150
Am I worrying for nothing?

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:05.350
What business are you in?

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:06.680
I'm a jeweler.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:07.830
You don't sell pepper?

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:08.510
No, no, no.

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:10.390
The Shi brothers here

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.290
are the ones who deal in pepper.

You guys and Ma Kui...

We were as close as brothers.

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:23.270
So when Ma Kui died, I was devastated.

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:24.240
Me too.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.270
The three of you were all
in the pepper business,

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:30.480
yet you could still be
as close as brothers.

His business was the biggest.

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.960
Did he not steal business from you two?

the whole story.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.200
that misled your judgment, Sheriff Du.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:36.790
Well...

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:38.310
I am ashamed.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.580
It seems the real killer is someone else.

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:43.280
That's right.

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:45.030
I was also there at the time,

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:46.790
but I was just watching the commotion.

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:48.030
I failed to notice

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:49.240
any suspicious person.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.720
This killer must have some skills.

00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:53.030
Otherwise,

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:56.570
it would have been difficult
to kill with a wooden blade.

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:04.030
But how should we proceed with
the investigation now?

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:05.510
I'm at a loss.

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:09.680
I hope you can offer some guidance,
Official Lu.

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:11.920
We should start by
investigating Ma Kui's enemies.

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:13.070
Setting aside those from the past,

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:14.310
the person he replaced,

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:16.270
that former member of
the Seven-Saint Blades,

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:18.800
must have harbored resentment
toward Ma Kui.

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:20.150
That's right.

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:22.380

The Zoroastrian Priest has gone to bed.

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:37.440
Wake him up.

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:41.320
Your speculation makes sense.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.480
The person who was replaced

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:44.960
would certainly feel resentful,

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:46.640
or maybe even harbor hatred.

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:49.740
But would it be so bad as to
lead to murder?

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Besides, I was the one
who finalized the list.

Anyone who was replaced

would certainly have been
someone I could persuade.

00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:56.990
Why beat around the bush?

00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:58.550
Just tell me who it is.

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.760
He was already upset enough,

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:04.680
and now you want to bother him
even further.

Do I really have to say it?

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:19.680
This murder case

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:21.880
is closely related to
the deity summoning ceremony.

please assist the county office

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:30.650
is my younger brother, He Qian.

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:31.350
He lives in

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:33.280
Yanzuo District near Mingde Gate.

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:52.290

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:53.480
Wait.

00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:56.410
Did He Qian not sleep or is he up early?

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:58.880
How is it that he's in the study
at 4 a.m.?

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:01.480
Master suffers from insomnia.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:02.960
When he was still staying

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:03.830
at Zoroastrian Priest He's place,

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:05.030
he already suffered from this
quite a lot.

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:06.790
It's gotten even worse in recent months.

00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:08.000
He can only sleep sitting up.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.000
That's why Master

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.310
likes to review accounts at night.

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:11.550
While doing so, he could fall asleep.

00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:13.590
Otherwise, if Master
stayed awake all night,

00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:15.050

What bad luck.

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:01.720
What's also to blame is that
Chang'an County

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:03.100

those 20 strokes from Sheriff Wei

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:27.680
made Qingcong remember him very clearly.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.750

No.

As for those he merely brushed past,

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:44.740
he probably didn't pay
that much attention to them,

00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:46.200
while Sheriff Wei

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:48.510
actually scared him quite badly.

might turn out to be very useful.

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:01.550
Take me, Fei, for example.

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:05.640
One day, when Lu Lingfeng
conquers the battlefield

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.270
and becomes a high official,
he'll definitely take me with him.

00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:11.400
Because I may seem useless,

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:13.340
but I'm actually quite valuable.

00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:15.960
Who would dare say you're useless?

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.730
Right, I was just about to
ask you for help.

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:22.270
This is something I found

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:24.590
at the murder scene in Yanzuo District.

00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:26.750
I noticed Sheriff Du didn't care about it,

00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:27.810
so I took it with me.

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:29.030
Look here.

00:27:30.790 --> 00:27:33.210
This is no ordinary water drop.

00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:34.790
Water couldn't have possibly left

00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:36.270
such a distinct mark.

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:37.790
I smelled it,

00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:40.480
and there's a special fragrance

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:41.960
that seems familiar.

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:44.330
I can't recall what it is at the moment.

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:46.640
You have the sharpest nose.
Help me smell it.

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:47.500
Let me smell it.

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:57.440
There really is a fragrance,

00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:00.310
and it's quite unusual.

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:03.030
Your choice to come to me

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:05.400
was definitely right.

00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:06.720
Let me think.

00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:09.210
-What is this...
-Let me smell it.

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:11.110
Here.

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:16.140
It really is fragrant.

00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:19.200
It's urine!

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:21.830
What?

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:26.110
It's really urine.
If you don't believe me, taste it.

00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:27.310
I... Taste... You...

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:28.640
Master Fei.

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:31.000
This isn't ordinary urine.

00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:32.680
It's from a Fengli beast.

00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:33.650
Give it to me.

00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:42.590
Mr. Fei!

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:44.830
To solve the case,

00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:46.550
tasting a bit of urine is nothing.

00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:49.480
I've confirmed it. It's definitely
Fengli beast's urine,

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:50.550
no doubt about it.

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:53.240
Academically known as Fengli fluid.

00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:54.940
The Fengli beast?

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:57.790
Could it be the one mentioned

00:28:57.790 --> 00:28:58.920
in those books our mentor Master Di

00:28:58.920 --> 00:28:59.680
left us?

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:01.590
Exactly.

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:04.590
The reason I recognized that smell

00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:07.350
is because years ago,
I accompanied Master Di

00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:09.240
to visit an old friend of his.

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:12.830
That elderly person
suffered from rheumatism.

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:15.720
When it flared up,
the pain was unbearable.

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:17.960
Only by taking this Fengli fluid

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:19.890
could he get temporary relief.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:20.480
So

00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:22.720
after all this talk,

00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:24.250
isn't it still just urine?

00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:26.210
How does this help solve the case?

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:29.790
The Fengli fluid is not easy to find,
you know?

00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:32.430
It used to be something worth a fortune.

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:34.350
Why do you say "used to be"?

00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:35.750
Because the Fengli fluid

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:37.350
can treat rheumatism.

00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:41.160
Later, this humble physician

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:43.190
developed a formula

00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:45.440
specifically for treating rheumatism,

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:46.720
so it lost its value.

00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:49.790
Of course, my formula

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:51.340
isn't a cure-all, either.

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:53.750
I've heard there's a type of

00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:56.000
particularly stubborn headache

00:29:57.030 --> 00:29:58.630
that my formula can't treat.

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:01.550
Only Fengli fluid can cure it.

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:02.790
Therefore,

00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:07.030
if the deceased didn't have this illness,

00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:10.720
then it must have belonged to the killer,

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:13.340
which makes it a clue, doesn't it?

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.860
Then... Should we look for clues
at pharmacies?

00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:19.530
Pharmacies don't sell it.

00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:23.510
I think I know where to start looking.

00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:25.040
Official Lu,

00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:27.750
what do you think of this lead?

00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:29.680
You call this a lead?

00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:31.070
How is this not a lead?

00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:33.830
It's not really one.

00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:35.570
Then what's your opinion?

00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:37.240
Three murders

00:30:37.550 --> 00:30:38.750
within a single day.

00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:40.550
The identities of the victims—

00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:42.080
what do they have in common?

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:43.550
They were all merchants.

00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:45.010
It might be a coincidence,

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:47.830
but it's likely not.

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:50.070
That statement of yours

00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:51.840
hits the nail on the head.

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:54.030
Shi Qiansui, the Sogdian merchant,

00:30:54.030 --> 00:30:56.550
is the leader of An Society,
an organization for merchants

00:30:56.550 --> 00:30:57.880
from both the East Market
and the West Market,

00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:00.210
and he's also the biggest spice merchant.

00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:01.480
The Sogdian merchants

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:03.840
generally follow Zoroastrianism,

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:06.920
so the court
established the High Priest's Office

00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:07.960
to oversee them.

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:09.790
This Shi Qiansui is

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:12.290
the High Priest of
the High Priest's Office.

00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:16.000
Ma Kui's qualification as part of
the Seven-Saint Blade lineup

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.350
was only granted through

00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:18.480
Shi Qiansui's endorsement.

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:20.680
Therefore, meeting this Shi Qiansui

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:22.210
should be our priority.

00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:24.960
I've already sent Xue Huan to inquire.

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:26.350
At this moment, he's inspecting

00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:28.160
the Xian temple in Buzheng District.

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:30.820
Hurry up and eat. When you're done,
come with me.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:33.550
Yingtao.

00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:36.030
I've heard the Zoroastrian temple
in Buzheng District

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:37.200
is the largest in all of Chang'an.

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:38.590
Let's go see it together.

00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:40.240
No way! If you all go,

00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:41.110
it'll be me, Fei,

00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:42.310
watching the shop alone again.

00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:44.640
Are we still running this business or not?

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:48.110
There's a type of roast chicken
in Buzheng District

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:49.440
cooked in a special way.

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:50.590
They stuff the cavity

00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:51.920
with various fruits

00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:54.270
and coat it with honey before roasting.

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:55.960
If I bring one back

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:57.110
for you, Master Fei,

00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:58.500
would you let us all go?

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.720
They have roast chicken like this?

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:03.440
How come I've never heard of it?

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:05.680
W-Will you really bring one back for me?

00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:07.590
Mr. Fei, when has Xijun

00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:08.990
ever broken her promise?

00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:10.240
It's just that

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:12.390
Sushan Shop would fall apart

00:32:12.510 --> 00:32:13.710
without you, Mr. Fei.

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:15.920
You all, go ahead.

00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:18.270
Young people should go out and have fun.

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:20.350
I, Boss Fei, am here
to take care of the shop.

00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:21.410
Don't worry at all.

00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:38.400
[High Priest Shi Qiansui]

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:21.030
It's true that Ma Kui earned
the Seven-Saint Blade title this month

00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:22.680
because of my endorsement.

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:25.480
But I didn't take any money from him.

00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:27.400
We're not here to investigate that.

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:29.330
But I need to make this clear to you.

00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:31.800
As the leader of An Society,

00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:33.480
I care for every merchant

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:34.480
in Chang'an.

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:37.070
That's also why His Majesty granted me

00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:39.070
the fifth-rank official position.

00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:42.880
The standard for becoming
a Seven-Saint Blade

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:45.010
is being an influential Zoroastrian.

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:47.160
Some thought Ma Kui wasn't devout,

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:49.510
believing he joined the Seven-Saint Blades

00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:51.000
just to receive divine blessings

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.590
and continue making fortunes.

00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:53.440
But I believed

00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:56.200
he had been
the most influential Zoroastrian

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:58.140
in the business world recently.

00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:00.160
In just a few years, he became

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:02.720
the biggest pepper merchant
in the East Market.

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.250
That was quite remarkable.

00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:06.790
So I believed he deserved a chance.

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:11.590
As for enemies,

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:13.639
he probably had some.

00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:15.400
But

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:16.840
I don't think

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:18.800
they would be merchants.

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:21.400
Why are you so certain, High Priest?

00:34:22.150 --> 00:34:24.070
I don't know. Just intuition.

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:26.199
Alright then.

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:27.400
High Priest, if you

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:28.630
remember anything else,

00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:29.760
contact me anytime.

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:31.320
You're from the Lu family of Fanyang,

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:32.780
nobility among nobility.

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:34.850
You'll protect merchants, right?

00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:40.110
As the Yongzhou Judicial Official,

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:40.960
it's my duty

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:42.159
to protect everyone.

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:43.000
Of course,

00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:45.489
including merchants.

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:55.030
Xijun.

00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:00.190
Lu.

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:01.130
Sheriff Wei.

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:02.280
Mr. Su.

00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:04.030
As discussed previously,

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:05.800
we've been investigating the Zoroastrians,

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:07.730
but we haven't found anything yet.

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:11.090
Thank you for your hard work, Sheriff Wei.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:14.730
Official Lu,

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:16.320
please, you must catch the murderer

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:17.980
and avenge my brother He Qian!

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:20.440
Zoroastrian Priest He, there's no need
to be so agitated.

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:21.190
Sheriff Wei

00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:23.230
is working diligently on this case.

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:24.400
Him?

00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:25.950
What's wrong?

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:27.970
Don't you know Sheriff Wei?

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:29.670
Of course I do.

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:32.140
Actually, we're even relatives.

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:36.360
Zoroastrian Priest He, you and Sheriff Wei
are relatives?

00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:38.710
I wonder how you're related?

00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:40.240
It's not worth mentioning.

00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:48.320
Official Lu.

00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:51.510
Today, my family has a joyous occasion,

00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:53.110
so I'm hosting a banquet to celebrate.

00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:55.360
We haven't been well acquainted before,

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:56.920
but after investigating the case
together yesterday,

00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:58.190
your demeanor of the Lu family of Fanyang

00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:59.650
has earned my admiration.

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:01.630
I'd like to extend
a last-minute invitation to you.

00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:03.760
Would you honor us with your presence?

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:07.400
Although we're investigating
a murder case,

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:09.360
the family banquet was arranged long ago.

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:11.280
Moreover, friends have come
from the Eastern Capital

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:12.280
specifically for this banquet.

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:13.960
So I cannot reschedule it.

00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:15.950
I understand.

00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:19.000
May I ask what joyous occasion
your family is celebrating?

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.670
Last month, when the Jinguang Society
was carrying out major construction,

00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:25.530
they unexpectedly unearthed
our Wei family's merit-record pillar.

00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:29.190
So your ancestral merit-record pillar
has come to light again?

00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:31.280
That is indeed a great cause
for celebration.

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:32.740
I shall certainly attend.

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:33.500
Excellent.

00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:37.000
I wonder...

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:40.290
Mr. Su,

00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:41.250
I apologize.

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:42.760
Regarding viewing the merit-record pillar,

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:43.820
I didn't invite you

00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:44.440
because

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:47.400
all those attending today
are from prominent noble families.

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.280
Although the Su family of Wugong...

00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:50.340
No need to explain.

00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:52.360
I know my place.

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:55.660
Besides, I have other matters
to attend to tonight.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.220
Xijun, come here.

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:00.440
Come on.

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:03.840
But Miss Pei here

00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:06.030
should be able to go with him, right?

00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:10.040
Could you be from
the Pei family of Hedong?

00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:13.150
I'm from the eastern branch
of the Pei family of Hedong.

00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:15.030
So the former Minister of Personnel,
Pei Jian?

00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:16.030
That's my father.

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:19.600
My apologies for the oversight.

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:21.550
The Pei family of Hedong
is a distinguished line of officials.

00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:23.000
According to the family records,
it has 5 branches:

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.920
the central branch, the western branch,
the Xima branch,

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:26.120
the Nanlai Wu branch,

00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:27.880
and then there's the eastern branch,

00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:29.340
to which Miss Pei belongs.

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:31.710
If you could accompany Lu,

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.960
it would be my great honor.

00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:37.360
Thank you for your invitation,
Sheriff Wei.

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:38.190
Well then,

00:37:41.110 --> 00:37:42.400
I shall respectfully accept.

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:43.320
Excellent.

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:45.000
Lu,

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:46.880
Mr. Su.

00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:49.960
Come with me.

00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:56.960
The Wei family's merit-record pillar
resurfacing

00:37:57.550 --> 00:37:59.080
is truly a joyous occasion.

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:04.030
Su Wuming.

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.330
I know you're fond of antiquities.

00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:07.150
It's just...

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:08.510
It's fine.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.960
Your elite noble family gathering

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:12.290
is not for Yingtao and me

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:13.670
to presume to join.

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:14.560
That's right.

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:15.440
Su Wuming,

00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:18.360
you should take me to do
something worthwhile instead.

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:20.230
Now I can go investigate

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:23.120
that lead which you didn't consider
a lead, right?

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:25.020
As you wish.

[Moxiang Bookstore]

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:40.550
Su Wuming, you said
we were looking for clues,

00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:42.440
but you've buried yourself
in this bookshop,

00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:43.000
leaving me alone

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:43.840
to wait here.

00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:44.840
I'm so bored.

00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:46.490
I went to the bookshop

00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:48.350
precisely to look for clues.

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:50.620
If you don't believe me, look.

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:56.710
In the wilderness of Lingnan,
there's a beast

00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:57.840
called Fengli.

00:38:58.710 --> 00:39:00.070
It resembles a monkey,

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:02.070
with long eyebrows and a bashful nature.

00:39:02.070 --> 00:39:04.840
When it sees people, it behaves shyly
like a young woman.

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:08.300
Its urine is said to be able to
treat rheumatism and headaches.

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:10.670
So its urine really can cure diseases?

00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:12.530
I thought Mr. Fei was making it up.

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:13.960
Keep reading.

00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:17.430
When the Fengli appears,
it carries a cane,

00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:18.880
called the Fengli cane.

00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:21.230
This beast is very cunning

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:22.760
and moves in a secretive manner.

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:25.320
It only shows itself
when it sees no one around.

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:27.580
Beneath a tree,
it holds the Fengli cane,

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:29.190
points at a bird's nest,

00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:31.520
and the nest falls
as the cane points at it.

00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:33.810
My goodness.

00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:38.480
The Fengli beast itself
is already quite strange, isn't it?

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:41.010
But this Fengli cane
is even more mysterious,

00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:42.800
which makes it hard to obtain.

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:43.700
Legend has it

00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:46.440
that even if you catch the Fengli beast,

00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:48.110
it won't easily

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:50.360
reveal the whereabouts of its cane.

00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:52.440
It won't bring out the Fengli cane

00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:54.650
unless you give it a good beating first.

00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:57.050
T-That's so fascinating.

00:39:58.150 --> 00:40:00.030
Once you obtain the Fengli cane,

00:40:00.110 --> 00:40:01.230
it's incredible.

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:04.440
Any raptor, fierce beast, or villain,

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:06.800
you point the cane at them,

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:09.170
and they die instantly.

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:10.880
Any treasure you desire,

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:12.710
pearls or agates,

00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:14.630
you point the cane at them,

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:16.840
and they fall right into your hands.

00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:18.560
I-Is this real

00:40:18.590 --> 00:40:19.920
or just a myth?

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.670
Whether it's real or not,

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:26.480
find a place that sells Fengli canes.

Buy one, and we'll find out.

Then I'll buy one and point it at you.

Why point it at me?
