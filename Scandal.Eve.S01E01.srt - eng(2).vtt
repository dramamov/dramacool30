-Where are you? It starts in five minutes.
-Five minutes?

00:00:30.468 --> 00:00:32.470
I'm still in Shibuya.

00:00:32.554 --> 00:00:35.515
It'll take me ten more minutes.

00:00:35.598 --> 00:00:37.559
You'll be too late. Go faster.

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:41.312
I can't. I'm already at the speed limit.

00:00:42.522 --> 00:00:44.732
Park at the front when you get here.

00:00:47.527 --> 00:00:49.904
It's been a while, Mr. Aso.

00:00:49.988 --> 00:00:52.323
It's nice to see you again, Ioka.

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.159
You've been doing well.

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:55.702
Thank you.

00:00:56.202 --> 00:00:58.913
Keep it up, Chief.

00:01:05.712 --> 00:01:08.339
Mr. Aso's moving to the stage wing. Hurry.

00:01:14.512 --> 00:01:15.680
Any luck, Chief?

00:01:15.763 --> 00:01:19.100
Mori found one that fits.
She's bringing it now.

00:01:19.184 --> 00:01:22.520
How could they just change outfits
at the last minute like this?

00:01:25.732 --> 00:01:26.900
Saki.

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:32.947
Was this Ms. Yoko's idea?

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.159
It's not for you to worry about.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.496
You're up in five minutes.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.706
-Okay.
-Okay.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.210
-Kagawa, come with me.
-Okay.

00:01:57.096 --> 00:01:59.515
HIDETO ASO
KURYU FUJIWARA

00:02:03.436 --> 00:02:04.395
Saki.

00:02:04.896 --> 00:02:06.272
Saki!

00:02:07.023 --> 00:02:08.524
Are you being serious?

00:02:08.608 --> 00:02:11.319
We have no time. I'll go get the coat.

00:02:11.402 --> 00:02:12.487
Yeah, but that's--

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.864
We can't lose to a petty tactic like this.

00:02:14.948 --> 00:02:18.409
-I get that, but isn't this going a bit--
-Kagawa.

00:02:32.548 --> 00:02:34.634
Welcome, Ms. Yoko.

00:02:34.717 --> 00:02:35.802
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

00:02:35.885 --> 00:02:39.222
-It's nice to see you.
-Likewise. This way, please.

00:02:47.105 --> 00:02:51.109
Yes? Yes, it's fine. I have their number.

00:02:52.193 --> 00:02:55.613
I'll get to it soon. Bye.

00:03:24.642 --> 00:03:26.102
-Mori!
-It's in the back.

00:03:29.772 --> 00:03:30.732
Thank you!

00:03:44.203 --> 00:03:45.163
Hello?

00:03:45.663 --> 00:03:47.832
Is this Ms. Mori's number?

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.004
That was the first episode
of Proof of Recollection,

00:03:53.087 --> 00:03:55.631
a show commemorating
JBS TV's 70th anniversary.

00:03:55.715 --> 00:03:57.383
We hope you enjoyed it.

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:59.594
Thank you.

00:03:59.677 --> 00:04:00.762
PROOF OF RECOLLECTION

00:04:00.845 --> 00:04:03.848
The filming is still ongoing,

00:04:03.931 --> 00:04:09.645
but both of the lead actors are here
for this event today.

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:10.897
Please welcome--

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:13.983
Please wait.

00:04:15.485 --> 00:04:16.944
Please wait a moment.

00:04:27.121 --> 00:04:28.122
Ms. Yoko.

00:04:28.206 --> 00:04:31.125
What's this? Some technical issue?

00:04:31.626 --> 00:04:32.460
I apologize.

00:04:32.543 --> 00:04:36.130
The lighting equipment is malfunctioning.
We'll fix it promptly.

00:04:36.714 --> 00:04:40.760
Try not to make our Aso look bad, okay?

00:04:40.843 --> 00:04:42.804
Of course, ma'am.

00:04:42.887 --> 00:04:43.930
Fix it now!

00:04:44.013 --> 00:04:44.931
Yes, sir.

00:04:57.735 --> 00:05:00.238
I apologize for the delay.

00:05:00.321 --> 00:05:02.865
It looks like we're ready now,

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:05.159
so please welcome
both of them to the stage.

00:05:05.243 --> 00:05:07.036
Kuryu! Hurry up!

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.246
Saki.

00:05:08.913 --> 00:05:15.545
To celebrate JBS TV's 70th anniversary,
we have invited Mr. Aso and Mr. Fujiwara.

00:05:15.628 --> 00:05:16.587
Wait.

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.881
Give them a round of applause!

00:05:18.965 --> 00:05:21.592
Be confident. You can do it.

00:05:22.093 --> 00:05:23.761
This way, please.

00:05:26.764 --> 00:05:27.890
Thank you.

00:06:25.156 --> 00:06:26.157
Let's see.

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:29.619
I think the teamwork
between the crew and the cast

00:06:29.702 --> 00:06:32.288
comes through in the final product.

00:06:32.914 --> 00:06:36.500
I think it will be worthy
of the 70th anniversary…

00:06:36.584 --> 00:06:37.627
Ioka.

00:06:40.713 --> 00:06:42.381
Sorry about the coat.

00:06:43.174 --> 00:06:45.176
Ms. Yoko made the last-minute change.

00:06:45.676 --> 00:06:47.053
It's just harassment.

00:06:47.136 --> 00:06:50.473
I couldn't let Kuryu go on stage
with the same outfit as Mr. Aso.

00:06:52.767 --> 00:06:55.561
I think you really struck a nerve

00:06:55.645 --> 00:06:59.815
by bypassing her and getting the chairman
on board with Kuryu's return to TV.

00:07:01.943 --> 00:07:03.653
Yeah, I underestimated her.

00:07:04.153 --> 00:07:06.530
I didn't expect all this in return.

00:07:07.198 --> 00:07:08.741
Be careful, okay?

00:07:08.824 --> 00:07:11.494
Your boss is the reason
I have to be careful.

00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:18.584
Let's get some comments
from Mr. Fujiwara now.

00:07:18.668 --> 00:07:22.880
I believe this will be your first role
in a drama after going independent.

00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:26.884
Well, to be honest,

00:07:27.843 --> 00:07:31.013
these last few years,
it hasn't been easy.

00:07:32.056 --> 00:07:34.267
But I am overjoyed to get the chance

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:39.272
to be on a JBS TV drama again.

00:07:55.371 --> 00:07:56.622
That jacket.

00:07:57.790 --> 00:07:59.125
It suits him well.

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:02.628
Thank you.

00:08:03.713 --> 00:08:05.881
Kuryu's looking more dependable now.

00:08:08.217 --> 00:08:13.222
Ever since he left us and joined you,
he's been doing great.

00:08:15.099 --> 00:08:16.058
Ms. Yoko.

00:08:16.726 --> 00:08:21.063
Thank you for letting Kuryu
co-star with Mr. Aso.

00:08:21.147 --> 00:08:22.815
Don't thank me.

00:08:23.316 --> 00:08:25.818
Shouldn't you be thanking
the chairman instead?

00:08:27.403 --> 00:08:30.615
Not at all. I'm also grateful to you.

00:08:32.241 --> 00:08:33.409
I guess so.

00:08:34.827 --> 00:08:39.248
You got to make the industry think
that we are on good terms, after all.

00:08:43.252 --> 00:08:44.295
Chief.

00:08:44.378 --> 00:08:46.631
Excuse me. Can I talk to you?

00:08:48.591 --> 00:08:49.800
Excuse me.

00:08:59.602 --> 00:09:01.395
You bought enough time. Thank you.

00:09:01.479 --> 00:09:04.774
Sure, but the thing is…

00:09:06.776 --> 00:09:08.152
What's wrong?

00:09:10.488 --> 00:09:13.783
A reporter from Weekly Buncho called me.

00:09:14.784 --> 00:09:18.162
One of their articles this week
will be a scandal involving Kuryu.

00:09:18.871 --> 00:09:20.164
A scandal?

00:10:14.427 --> 00:10:15.344
Good night.

00:10:15.428 --> 00:10:17.221
Good night to you too.

00:10:17.304 --> 00:10:18.431
Bye.

00:10:20.516 --> 00:10:21.434
Hey.

00:10:21.934 --> 00:10:25.479
Saki wants to talk to you.
She's waiting in the car.

00:10:25.563 --> 00:10:27.231
Okay, got it.

00:10:36.115 --> 00:10:37.450
-You did well.
-Saki.

00:10:37.533 --> 00:10:39.368
You too.

00:10:43.914 --> 00:10:46.125
-Hey, Kuryu.
-What?

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.128
Anything strange happen recently?

00:10:49.628 --> 00:10:51.088
Where's that coming from?

00:10:52.506 --> 00:10:54.592
What? Did something happen?

00:10:57.887 --> 00:11:00.181
A reporter from Weekly Buncho called us.

00:11:00.973 --> 00:11:01.807
Weekly Buncho?

00:11:01.891 --> 00:11:04.310
They said they'll publish a scandal.

00:11:05.561 --> 00:11:06.854
Is it about me?

00:11:09.315 --> 00:11:11.025
What kind of scandal?

00:11:11.108 --> 00:11:12.485
I don't know yet.

00:11:13.068 --> 00:11:15.654
They'll mail us the details tomorrow.

00:11:16.989 --> 00:11:19.366
If you know anything, tell me now.

00:11:20.784 --> 00:11:22.870
So we can prepare.

00:11:32.671 --> 00:11:33.714
I don't.

00:11:35.007 --> 00:11:37.343
-Are you sure?
-Of course I am.

00:11:37.426 --> 00:11:40.554
-Anything involving women?
-Come on, Saki!

00:11:40.638 --> 00:11:42.306
I just had a child.

00:11:43.098 --> 00:11:46.977
How about any drugs, gambling,
or some kind of violent--

00:11:47.061 --> 00:11:48.187
Saki!

00:11:50.439 --> 00:11:53.651
After I went independent,
you've known me better than anyone.

00:11:54.401 --> 00:11:55.778
It's probably nonsense.

00:11:59.323 --> 00:12:00.324
Right.

00:12:01.784 --> 00:12:03.118
Sorry about that.

00:12:04.328 --> 00:12:05.538
It's okay.

00:12:07.289 --> 00:12:10.459
Let me know the details
once you get them tomorrow.

00:12:11.627 --> 00:12:13.295
Okay, I will.

00:12:15.089 --> 00:12:16.006
Good night.

00:12:16.674 --> 00:12:17.800
Good night.

00:12:30.354 --> 00:12:33.274
Before I forget,
I have an announcement for you all.

00:12:33.357 --> 00:12:38.279
My baby products brand, Twinkle Hug,
has been working on some new pacifiers,

00:12:38.362 --> 00:12:41.657
and they're finally ready!

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.909
Check these out. Aren't they cute?

00:12:43.993 --> 00:12:47.121
There's more with other designs too.

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:54.878
I'll share the full details
on an official post later.

00:12:54.962 --> 00:12:57.214
That's all for today.

00:12:57.298 --> 00:13:00.926
See you next time.
Bye-bye. Thanks for watching!

00:13:03.012 --> 00:13:03.887
Welcome back.

00:13:04.513 --> 00:13:05.431
I'm home.

00:13:05.514 --> 00:13:08.309
How was the event?
It was a big topic online.

00:13:08.392 --> 00:13:11.103
It went pretty well.

00:13:11.186 --> 00:13:14.732
That's good.
Could you hold these real quick?

00:13:14.815 --> 00:13:16.233
-What?
-And stand here.

00:13:16.317 --> 00:13:17.610
Okay. What are these?

00:13:17.693 --> 00:13:18.527
Here you go.

00:13:19.028 --> 00:13:21.155
Oh, the samples are ready?

00:13:21.238 --> 00:13:25.159
Yeah, preparations for the launch event
have been going smoothly too.

00:13:25.242 --> 00:13:27.411
You have to help with the marketing too.

00:13:27.494 --> 00:13:29.496
Yeah, sure. I will.

00:13:30.706 --> 00:13:32.374
All good. Thanks.

00:13:37.546 --> 00:13:38.881
Just went to sleep.

00:13:42.885 --> 00:13:43.802
Did I wake you?

00:13:46.472 --> 00:13:47.514
I'm home.

00:14:45.698 --> 00:14:46.532
Yes?

00:14:47.992 --> 00:14:51.745
Sorry for calling so late.
I'm Ioka, representing Rafale.

00:14:52.955 --> 00:14:56.208
Thank you for the call.
I'm Hirata from Weekly Buncho.

00:14:56.709 --> 00:14:59.545
I didn't expect the CEO
to call me directly.

00:15:00.337 --> 00:15:04.591
I wanted to talk about the matter
with our talent, Kuryu Fujiwara.

00:15:06.051 --> 00:15:08.220
I'll mail you the details tomorrow.

00:15:08.721 --> 00:15:11.390
I would like to meet you in person.

00:15:12.558 --> 00:15:13.684
In person?

00:15:14.601 --> 00:15:17.730
I would like to confirm
as many of the details as possible.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.357
To avoid any misunderstandings.

00:15:22.026 --> 00:15:26.113
Alright. Visit our office
at ten o'clock tomorrow morning.

00:15:26.613 --> 00:15:27.865
Understood.

00:15:27.948 --> 00:15:31.076
I'll be there together
with an associate named Kagawa.

00:15:32.244 --> 00:15:33.829
Goodbye then.

00:15:43.464 --> 00:15:44.757
YURI HARA'S SUICIDE

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.717
Give my Yuri back!

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.469
You monster!

00:16:05.194 --> 00:16:08.113
-Sorry, I used a business card as a note.
-It's fine.

00:16:08.197 --> 00:16:09.907
-Who was that?
-Ms. Ioka.

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:13.869
-The CEO of Kuryu Fujiwara's agency.
-Kuryu Fujiwara? Why did she call?

00:16:13.952 --> 00:16:16.455
He's going to become
the top story for this week.

00:16:16.538 --> 00:16:18.832
Top story? That's pretty sudden.

00:16:18.916 --> 00:16:21.126
The editor-in-chief insisted.

00:16:21.794 --> 00:16:24.797
He must have wanted it
to coincide it with the drama interview.

00:16:25.589 --> 00:16:26.715
You think so?

00:16:38.519 --> 00:16:39.603
INCOMING CALL: R

00:16:43.023 --> 00:16:44.483
-Who was that?
-What?

00:16:44.566 --> 00:16:45.400
Nothing.

00:16:48.946 --> 00:16:50.155
I'm tired.

00:16:54.034 --> 00:16:55.244
I need a shower.

00:17:34.658 --> 00:17:37.202
Fujiwara said he doesn't know?

00:17:37.286 --> 00:17:39.413
Yeah, he said it must be some nonsense.

00:17:39.496 --> 00:17:40.581
I see.

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:44.334
Now is a bad time
for some absurd article to get printed.

00:17:45.961 --> 00:17:48.922
-We have to make them cancel it.
-Right.

00:17:57.598 --> 00:18:00.726
BUNCHO OFFICE

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:04.021
Thank you.

00:18:04.104 --> 00:18:05.606
They're waiting over there.

00:18:08.025 --> 00:18:09.610
Sorry for the wait.

00:18:11.528 --> 00:18:13.238
I'm Hirata from Weekly Buncho.

00:18:13.822 --> 00:18:15.365
I'm Ioka from Rafale.

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.410
I'm Kagawa, the vice-president.

00:18:18.911 --> 00:18:21.663
-Sorry about the sudden appointment.
-It's fine.

00:18:22.456 --> 00:18:25.167
-Would you prefer coffee or tea?
-Neither.

00:18:25.709 --> 00:18:28.879
I'd like to get to business right away.

00:18:29.504 --> 00:18:30.756
As you wish.

00:18:31.465 --> 00:18:34.092
-Can you get us three coffees?
-Just a moment.

00:18:35.135 --> 00:18:38.305
We believe that Kuryu is clean.

00:18:39.181 --> 00:18:40.641
If this article has no basis,

00:18:40.724 --> 00:18:43.518
we are prepared to take
strict legal action in retaliation.

00:18:44.311 --> 00:18:45.354
It's well-founded.

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:49.524
Six years ago,
Mr. Fujiwara married Mirei Yoshikawa

00:18:49.608 --> 00:18:51.443
who was an idol at the time, right?

00:18:51.526 --> 00:18:52.361
Yes.

00:18:52.444 --> 00:18:53.779
They're a famous couple,

00:18:53.862 --> 00:18:57.449
and the wife even started
a baby products brand recently.

00:18:57.532 --> 00:19:00.035
So you've done your research. What of it?

00:19:01.203 --> 00:19:04.331
My article is about Mr. Fujiwara's affair.

00:19:05.582 --> 00:19:06.416
An affair?

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:08.377
Our company received a leak.

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:09.836
It said that five years ago,

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:13.507
he stayed overnight at a hotel
with a woman he met at a bar in Yokohama.

00:19:14.299 --> 00:19:15.342
Five years ago?

00:19:15.926 --> 00:19:19.471
Mr. Fujiwara was still affiliated
with Kodama Productions back then,

00:19:19.554 --> 00:19:22.849
and I hear you weren't managing him then.

00:19:22.933 --> 00:19:25.811
-It's natural that you don't know.
-Hold on.

00:19:25.894 --> 00:19:28.772
You're writing an article
based on just that?

00:19:28.855 --> 00:19:32.734
That information has no credibility,
and also, where did that leak come from?

00:19:32.818 --> 00:19:34.319
In terms of confidentiality,

00:19:34.403 --> 00:19:37.281
I cannot share my source
or their personal information.

00:19:37.364 --> 00:19:40.742
Maybe so, but without knowing that,
we have no way to--

00:19:40.826 --> 00:19:42.160
Have a look.

00:19:49.543 --> 00:19:50.544
Is this…

00:19:53.547 --> 00:19:55.507
That's Kuryu Fujiwara, right?

00:19:59.678 --> 00:20:01.054
Seem more credible now?

00:20:02.264 --> 00:20:04.641
Will these pictures be in the article?

00:20:04.725 --> 00:20:05.809
Of course.

00:20:07.144 --> 00:20:09.229
This is an important period for him.

00:20:09.313 --> 00:20:12.232
What's the point
of digging up dirt from five years ago?

00:20:12.316 --> 00:20:13.942
The public deserves to know.

00:20:14.026 --> 00:20:15.444
You just think it'll sell!

00:20:16.611 --> 00:20:19.489
You even timed it to match
with his return to TV dramas.

00:20:19.573 --> 00:20:22.159
So you agree
that it's Mr. Fujiwara in those pictures?

00:20:24.411 --> 00:20:26.872
I'll mail you a questionnaire later.

00:20:26.955 --> 00:20:29.041
This week's issue goes on sale Thursday.

00:20:29.124 --> 00:20:30.876
Please respond by noon tomorrow.

00:20:30.959 --> 00:20:32.294
You can have that copy.

00:20:32.377 --> 00:20:34.087
To confirm with Mr. Fujiwara.

00:20:37.591 --> 00:20:40.427
Excuse me. Here's your coffee.

00:20:54.566 --> 00:20:56.068
-Welcome back.
-Thanks.

00:20:56.151 --> 00:20:57.861
-Hirata!
-Yes?

00:21:01.073 --> 00:21:02.866
How's the Fujiwara thing going?

00:21:02.949 --> 00:21:04.201
Smoothly so far.

00:21:04.284 --> 00:21:06.119
I'll go do some field work today.

00:21:06.745 --> 00:21:07.662
What field work?

00:21:08.455 --> 00:21:10.207
I just need to look into something.

00:21:12.125 --> 00:21:14.044
Finish the advance copy today, okay?

00:21:14.127 --> 00:21:15.045
Got it.

00:21:17.005 --> 00:21:18.340
I'm going out for research.

00:21:18.423 --> 00:21:19.257
Research?

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:23.261
Ninomiya!

00:21:23.762 --> 00:21:24.638
Yes?

00:21:25.305 --> 00:21:26.765
You got a minute?

00:21:26.848 --> 00:21:27.808
Yes.

00:21:33.814 --> 00:21:36.525
I made the deposit for you-know-what.

00:21:41.029 --> 00:21:42.197
Thank you.

00:22:01.091 --> 00:22:02.342
Hello, ma'am.

00:22:03.427 --> 00:22:04.553
Kuryu.

00:22:05.637 --> 00:22:08.598
This is Mr. Tozaki, our legal advisor.

00:22:08.682 --> 00:22:09.724
I'm Tozaki.

00:22:09.808 --> 00:22:14.229
Ms. Ioka brought me up to speed,
but I need to confirm a few things.

00:22:14.855 --> 00:22:15.939
Okay.

00:22:16.022 --> 00:22:19.151
Can you confirm
that you are the one in these pictures?

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:22.904
That's--

00:22:22.988 --> 00:22:25.907
I cannot protect you
if you don't answer truthfully.

00:22:26.533 --> 00:22:28.243
Are you the one in the pictures?

00:22:32.122 --> 00:22:34.708
Saki. I swear, I didn't--

00:22:34.791 --> 00:22:36.209
Answer his questions.

00:22:36.293 --> 00:22:39.754
Mr. Tozaki specializes
in entertainment industry affairs.

00:22:40.255 --> 00:22:43.091
And he can help you,
provided you're honest with him.

00:22:49.055 --> 00:22:49.890
Kuryu.

00:22:59.399 --> 00:23:00.358
It's me.

00:23:02.777 --> 00:23:04.863
How long did you stay at the hotel?

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:06.364
What?

00:23:08.783 --> 00:23:11.536
I was drunk, so I went to sleep.

00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:13.705
Until morning then. With this woman?

00:23:15.957 --> 00:23:16.791
Yes.

00:23:17.417 --> 00:23:18.668
That's awful.

00:23:19.544 --> 00:23:22.964
But I swear, I didn't do anything!

00:23:23.048 --> 00:23:24.466
Fujiwara, please…

00:23:24.549 --> 00:23:26.760
It's the truth! I didn't do anything!

00:23:27.928 --> 00:23:31.681
I admit that I went to the hotel.

00:23:32.766 --> 00:23:33.683
But I…

00:23:35.143 --> 00:23:36.895
I was really drunk.

00:23:37.771 --> 00:23:40.607
I went to the hotel
with her and entered the room,

00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:43.735
but I went to sleep
while she was taking a shower!

00:23:44.861 --> 00:23:47.197
-I woke up the next morning.
-Is that really all?

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:49.407
Any chance you forgot
because you were drunk?

00:23:51.034 --> 00:23:52.035
None.

00:23:52.786 --> 00:23:55.705
I swear, I didn't do anything.
It's the truth!

00:23:58.750 --> 00:23:59.918
Even this picture.

00:24:00.877 --> 00:24:03.797
She took this without permission
while I was asleep!

00:24:06.967 --> 00:24:10.762
When I woke up, I realized my mistake.

00:24:11.846 --> 00:24:15.684
I apologized to her
and sent her home on a taxi.

00:24:15.767 --> 00:24:19.271
If so, why is she naked in the picture?

00:24:20.313 --> 00:24:21.648
I already told you.

00:24:21.731 --> 00:24:26.152
She took a shower,
and I went to sleep first!

00:24:26.236 --> 00:24:28.989
I'm wearing a shirt in this!
I'm wearing clothes!

00:24:33.285 --> 00:24:35.120
I'm telling the truth!

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:36.871
You have to believe me!

00:24:37.455 --> 00:24:40.834
I regretted going there
and ended things immediately.

00:24:41.501 --> 00:24:42.752
Trust me!

00:24:44.254 --> 00:24:47.299
I didn't cheat on my wife.

00:24:51.594 --> 00:24:53.722
Okay, I will trust you.

00:24:54.431 --> 00:24:56.933
-Saki--
-But the public won't.

00:24:57.767 --> 00:25:01.021
You spent a long time
in a hotel with this woman,

00:25:01.104 --> 00:25:03.356
and could have engaged in sexual acts.

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:07.485
Even if a magazine calls it adultery,
it will be hard to sue for libel.

00:25:07.569 --> 00:25:10.196
-But…
-The issue isn't whether you did it.

00:25:11.197 --> 00:25:15.076
If they call it adultery in an article
and the public believes what's written,

00:25:15.869 --> 00:25:18.413
the facts won't stop it
from becoming the truth.

00:25:18.496 --> 00:25:19.914
But that's just…

00:25:20.832 --> 00:25:24.502
Can we negotiate with the publisher
and get them to retract the article?

00:25:25.253 --> 00:25:27.714
It will be tough
for a company of your size.

00:25:27.797 --> 00:25:29.716
Maybe Kodama Productions could do it.

00:25:31.468 --> 00:25:35.263
In addition, while you
could claim it's a violation of privacy,

00:25:36.014 --> 00:25:40.810
the law permits the act of reporting
on public personalities like yourself.

00:25:41.603 --> 00:25:44.105
If you did in fact
stay at the hotel with her,

00:25:44.189 --> 00:25:45.607
we can't stop the article.

00:25:46.608 --> 00:25:49.986
If the article blows up,
you will most likely lose your drama role.

00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:51.488
Not to mention,

00:25:51.988 --> 00:25:55.700
you have advertisement contracts
with companies that operate nationally.

00:25:55.784 --> 00:25:58.078
You might have to pay
huge sums in reparations.

00:25:58.828 --> 00:26:01.790
What? But…

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:08.004
Why? But wait, that's not…

00:26:08.088 --> 00:26:10.465
Why? It doesn't make any…

00:26:10.965 --> 00:26:12.384
I didn't even…

00:26:12.467 --> 00:26:13.676
I already told you.

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:17.972
Going to the hotel in itself
is the issue, even if you did nothing.

00:26:21.559 --> 00:26:24.562
Mori, call the production companies
we're working with.

00:26:24.646 --> 00:26:26.648
Cancel all filming from tomorrow onward.

00:26:27.357 --> 00:26:30.318
We can buy a few days
if we say he caught the flu.

00:26:31.403 --> 00:26:32.237
Okay.

00:26:33.321 --> 00:26:34.989
-Kagawa, come.
-Yes, ma'am.

00:26:44.999 --> 00:26:46.501
What do we do?

00:26:46.584 --> 00:26:49.587
If we can't stop it,
we have to minimize the damage.

00:26:50.588 --> 00:26:53.675
We won't know how bad it will be
until it comes out.

00:26:54.175 --> 00:26:55.009
Then we…

00:26:56.719 --> 00:26:58.763
We'll do whatever we can.

00:27:01.599 --> 00:27:03.435
Hello, this is Ioka speaking.

00:27:03.518 --> 00:27:05.770
Are you at the TV station, Mr. Noguchi?

00:27:06.271 --> 00:27:08.690
I need to talk to you
about an urgent matter.

00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:11.359
Yes, can I come over there now?

00:27:12.819 --> 00:27:13.653
Okay.

00:27:14.154 --> 00:27:18.783
I'm very sorry for the trouble
our Fujiwara has caused you.

00:27:18.867 --> 00:27:21.786
An apology doesn't exactly help us.

00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:22.704
I know.

00:27:22.787 --> 00:27:25.290
An adultery scandal at this time?

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:28.543
Is that article really coming out?
Couldn't you stop it?

00:27:29.043 --> 00:27:31.045
We're trying, but it seems difficult--

00:27:31.129 --> 00:27:32.922
What will you do about this?

00:27:33.006 --> 00:27:35.925
You're the one who pushed
this casting choice, Noguchi.

00:27:36.009 --> 00:27:37.260
I'm sorry, sir.

00:27:38.595 --> 00:27:41.139
Does Ms. Yoko know about this mess yet?

00:27:41.222 --> 00:27:42.265
No, not yet.

00:27:43.224 --> 00:27:47.896
Man, why did this have to happen
before I got reshuffled?

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:52.066
At any rate, I will report this.

00:27:52.567 --> 00:27:54.235
Man…

00:27:56.779 --> 00:27:59.824
I'm really sorry for the trouble.

00:28:01.117 --> 00:28:02.410
It's not always a given

00:28:02.494 --> 00:28:05.830
that an adultery scandal
will lead to a show getting cancelled.

00:28:06.331 --> 00:28:08.458
It's all up to the public's reaction.

00:28:09.042 --> 00:28:12.045
Will the drama be able to air
if the article doesn't blow up?

00:28:12.128 --> 00:28:13.588
I think so.

00:28:13.671 --> 00:28:16.257
But it'll be bad
if it gets too much attention

00:28:16.341 --> 00:28:19.010
and the sponsors get concerned.

00:28:19.969 --> 00:28:22.138
I'll try to handle that too.

00:28:23.848 --> 00:28:26.351
In any case, I have to tell Ms. Yoko.

00:28:27.644 --> 00:28:30.104
I'll contact her on my end too.

00:28:33.399 --> 00:28:34.776
Goodbye.

00:28:47.497 --> 00:28:50.124
-Hello?
-I checked the advance copy.

00:28:50.208 --> 00:28:51.417
SHAMEFUL NIGHT IN YOKOHAMA

00:28:51.501 --> 00:28:52.502
How is it?

00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:55.547
The rest is fine.

00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:58.258
So fill in the conclusion
and send it to me again.

00:28:58.758 --> 00:29:00.760
Then I'll send it for proofreading.

00:29:00.844 --> 00:29:04.180
Got it. Can you wait
on the proofreading, though?

00:29:04.264 --> 00:29:06.432
I might rewrite parts of it.

00:29:06.933 --> 00:29:07.767
What?

00:29:08.935 --> 00:29:11.563
All right, but where are you right now?

00:29:12.313 --> 00:29:14.107
Sorry, I'll call you later.

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:41.551
You don't say.

00:29:42.343 --> 00:29:43.469
Kuryu, huh?

00:29:44.345 --> 00:29:46.347
I am deeply sorry.

00:29:46.848 --> 00:29:50.268
You were gracious enough
to grant him an opportunity,

00:29:50.935 --> 00:29:53.730
and the drama with Mr. Aso
was just getting started.

00:29:55.523 --> 00:29:56.733
And?

00:29:59.193 --> 00:30:00.653
What will you do?

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:06.117
I want to stop it
from being covered by news programs.

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:09.329
If we can manage that,
the damage will be minimized.

00:30:09.913 --> 00:30:11.915
So you came to ask me a favor.

00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:17.337
Chairman, there's no need for you to act.

00:30:18.212 --> 00:30:19.213
Yoko.

00:30:21.883 --> 00:30:23.676
I heard about the thing with Kuryu.

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:25.428
It's a shame.

00:30:26.721 --> 00:30:31.434
But do you remember
what you said when you left us?

00:30:32.018 --> 00:30:35.897
You can't nurture actors by giving them
lead roles that they haven't earned.

00:30:38.608 --> 00:30:42.570
I will nurture actors
with a different method.

00:30:42.654 --> 00:30:45.823
You said you would survive
in this industry with methods

00:30:45.907 --> 00:30:47.617
different from ours.

00:30:49.118 --> 00:30:50.787
Those were your words.

00:30:52.789 --> 00:30:58.211
Considering that, your actions now
are far too self-serving, aren't they?

00:31:02.882 --> 00:31:04.008
Please.

00:31:07.261 --> 00:31:08.429
How pitiful.

00:31:11.683 --> 00:31:15.520
He's a talent under your wing.
You should be fixing his mess.

00:31:15.603 --> 00:31:17.855
That's what your job is.

00:31:21.734 --> 00:31:22.860
Excuse me.

00:31:23.778 --> 00:31:24.779
Ioka.

00:31:28.366 --> 00:31:30.952
Don't be so quick to lower your head.

00:31:47.385 --> 00:31:48.511
Akashi?

00:31:49.512 --> 00:31:53.307
Kuryu's spot is opening up in that drama.

00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:57.937
Compile a list of potential substitutes
and send it to me.

00:32:06.863 --> 00:32:07.822
Hello?

00:32:07.905 --> 00:32:10.992
Ms. Ioka, this is Hirata
from Weekly Buncho.

00:32:11.075 --> 00:32:13.369
It's past the deadline
for the questionnaire.

00:32:13.453 --> 00:32:14.746
Did you fill it out?

00:32:20.918 --> 00:32:22.628
I'm Saki Ioka from Rafale.

00:32:23.129 --> 00:32:24.213
Over there.

00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:32.555
Thank you for coming.

00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:41.814
First of all, I would like to confirm
your answers to the questionnaire.

00:32:42.398 --> 00:32:44.817
Is the man in the picture Kuryu Fujiwara?

00:32:45.318 --> 00:32:48.362
Does Mr. Fujiwara admit
to engaging in infidelity?

00:32:48.863 --> 00:32:50.698
How will your agency respond to this?

00:32:55.953 --> 00:32:59.332
If you're willing to confirm
the claims made in the article,

00:32:59.415 --> 00:33:02.794
the wording and tone used
in it can be adjusted to an extent.

00:33:11.344 --> 00:33:12.178
This is?

00:33:18.935 --> 00:33:19.977
It's two million yen.

00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:25.149
You're trying to bribe me into silence?

00:33:25.233 --> 00:33:27.985
I can't say.
You're recording this, aren't you?

00:33:30.905 --> 00:33:32.657
You don't have a clue, do you?

00:33:34.534 --> 00:33:37.036
With all the attention
around Kuryu Fujiwara,

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:39.622
how much do you think
this article will make?

00:33:40.164 --> 00:33:44.794
Magazine sales, online views,
licensing fees from news media.

00:33:44.877 --> 00:33:48.297
Up to 100 million yen is a safe bet.
And you just offer two million?

00:33:50.174 --> 00:33:52.051
What's the point of this article?

00:33:52.635 --> 00:33:55.721
All it will do is
damage Kuryu and his family!

00:33:57.056 --> 00:33:58.141
Let me ask you.

00:33:58.224 --> 00:34:00.393
Why do you think magazines sell so much?

00:34:02.436 --> 00:34:04.147
It's simply retribution.

00:34:04.814 --> 00:34:05.648
Retribution?

00:34:06.232 --> 00:34:09.068
Entertainers sell an image,
including their private lives.

00:34:09.152 --> 00:34:12.280
In return, they get
to lead luxurious lives.

00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:16.075
If they abuse their position
and secretly engage in foul behavior,

00:34:16.159 --> 00:34:18.244
they should pay the price for it.

00:34:18.327 --> 00:34:21.581
And it's our duty
to expose their deception.

00:34:21.664 --> 00:34:24.458
That doesn't justify
ruining someone's life.

00:34:24.542 --> 00:34:27.044
His wife and child
are the biggest victims, right?

00:34:27.962 --> 00:34:30.047
Don't act like he's the victim here.

00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:33.801
Mr. Fujiwara is the one
who brought this upon himself.

00:34:38.723 --> 00:34:39.849
Once again,

00:34:39.932 --> 00:34:44.270
can I take it that your agency admits
the person in the photo is Mr. Fujiwara?

00:34:47.106 --> 00:34:48.232
Ms. Ioka?

00:34:49.108 --> 00:34:50.776
Excuse me. I have to leave.

00:35:01.245 --> 00:35:02.163
Come in.

00:35:22.892 --> 00:35:23.726
Well?

00:35:26.103 --> 00:35:26.938
I'm sorry.

00:35:27.021 --> 00:35:28.814
I don't want an apology.

00:35:30.316 --> 00:35:32.109
I want an explanation!

00:35:38.366 --> 00:35:40.743
It's true that I went to the hotel.

00:35:41.744 --> 00:35:45.623
I was drunk and went to sleep.
That's all that happened.

00:35:46.207 --> 00:35:47.166
That's all?

00:35:48.584 --> 00:35:49.543
What do you mean?

00:35:52.672 --> 00:35:56.926
You went to a hotel
with a woman and all you did was sleep.

00:35:59.053 --> 00:36:01.430
Do you think anyone will believe that?!

00:36:04.141 --> 00:36:06.519
Who's going to buy any of this?!

00:36:06.602 --> 00:36:10.273
Who'd want to use baby products
sold by an adulterer and his wife?!

00:36:10.356 --> 00:36:11.440
Mirei!

00:36:11.524 --> 00:36:14.026
Who would ever buy these pacifiers?!

00:36:19.532 --> 00:36:20.574
Ms. Mirei!

00:36:21.534 --> 00:36:22.535
Calm down!

00:36:22.618 --> 00:36:24.120
Get off me!

00:36:24.996 --> 00:36:26.289
Get out!

00:36:31.002 --> 00:36:35.131
If only Kuryu had never gone to you.

00:36:36.924 --> 00:36:40.720
If only he had stayed with Ms. Yoko,
it would never…

00:36:42.805 --> 00:36:45.766
This article would never
have seen the light of day!

00:36:46.767 --> 00:36:49.103
It's all over now!

00:36:49.186 --> 00:36:50.146
It's all over!

00:36:51.981 --> 00:36:53.816
How could you?!

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:56.694
How could you do this?!

00:36:58.154 --> 00:36:59.947
What will I do now?

00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:02.908
It's not over yet.

00:37:09.081 --> 00:37:12.460
I won't let this be the end.

00:37:18.841 --> 00:37:22.762
Chief, are you serious
about holding a press conference?

00:37:22.845 --> 00:37:26.182
I asked Mr. Tozaki
to create a list of mock questions.

00:37:26.766 --> 00:37:29.310
We'll make sure
the reporters are all on our side.

00:37:29.393 --> 00:37:32.772
But why?
Won't this just add more fuel to the fire?

00:37:33.272 --> 00:37:35.441
We'll devalue the Buncho article.

00:37:37.443 --> 00:37:41.280
If we share the facts ourselves
before the article comes out,

00:37:41.364 --> 00:37:44.033
we can prevent
any false rumors from spreading.

00:37:44.658 --> 00:37:46.702
The article will get less attention.

00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:49.997
-But--
-It's our only option!

00:38:02.551 --> 00:38:03.427
Kuryu.

00:38:06.263 --> 00:38:07.473
Wait.

00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:50.474
I would like to thank you all

00:38:50.558 --> 00:38:54.228
for gathering here today
on such short notice.

00:38:55.146 --> 00:39:01.277
Today, I wanted to directly tell you
about an important…

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:03.362
Press conference by Kuryu Fujiwara.

00:39:03.446 --> 00:39:04.905
They got the jump on us.

00:39:04.989 --> 00:39:07.116
Our sales are going to take a big hit.

00:39:07.199 --> 00:39:09.285
So where's our reporter for this story?

00:39:10.035 --> 00:39:12.371
Five years ago,

00:39:13.664 --> 00:39:16.375
at a friend's bar in Yokohama,

00:39:16.876 --> 00:39:21.297
I got some drinks
and later stayed overnight at a hotel…

00:39:23.966 --> 00:39:26.135
with a woman who was at the bar.

00:39:26.844 --> 00:39:31.724
An article about that occasion will be
published tomorrow by Weekly Buncho.

00:39:32.808 --> 00:39:37.855
On that night, I was heavily drunk.

00:39:38.856 --> 00:39:41.817
I fell asleep immediately
after entering the hotel room.

00:39:43.194 --> 00:39:45.779
Nothing happened
between me and that woman.

00:39:45.863 --> 00:39:47.907
EMERGENCY PRESS CONFERENCE

00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:53.162
Nevertheless,
I was a married man at the time,

00:39:53.787 --> 00:39:59.126
and I deeply regret my unfaithful actions.

00:40:00.044 --> 00:40:01.253
Once the article is out,

00:40:01.754 --> 00:40:08.010
many people will have to deal
with a lot of trouble as a result,

00:40:08.594 --> 00:40:12.598
so I wanted to explain it in my own words.

00:40:14.475 --> 00:40:21.065
I am deeply sorry
for bringing this upon all of you.

00:40:22.775 --> 00:40:28.364
And after thinking long and hard

00:40:29.198 --> 00:40:34.161
about who I had hurt most
with my thoughtless actions,

00:40:35.621 --> 00:40:36.789
I talked with her.

00:40:38.207 --> 00:40:42.127
And per her request,

00:40:43.170 --> 00:40:49.385
my wife will be joining me
for the remainder of this conference.

00:40:52.972 --> 00:40:53.889
Whoa!

00:41:17.705 --> 00:41:22.042
The two of you
already settled this issue five years ago.

00:41:22.793 --> 00:41:25.879
-I want you to go with that story.
-What?

00:41:25.963 --> 00:41:27.881
In the case of a cheating scandal,

00:41:27.965 --> 00:41:31.594
whether you can recover or not
depends on public reception.

00:41:32.636 --> 00:41:35.055
The most effective way to resolve this

00:41:35.139 --> 00:41:39.018
is for you to present the impression
that it's already water under the bridge.

00:41:39.101 --> 00:41:40.227
But why should I?

00:41:40.311 --> 00:41:42.563
I understand how you feel.

00:41:43.439 --> 00:41:45.649
Even if nothing ultimately happened,

00:41:46.358 --> 00:41:49.903
Kuryu betrayed you
by going to a hotel with another woman.

00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:53.115
Your anger is justified.

00:41:53.699 --> 00:41:57.119
But this is for your sake too.

00:41:57.786 --> 00:41:58.621
What?

00:41:58.704 --> 00:41:59.997
At this rate,

00:42:00.497 --> 00:42:04.251
the reputation of your baby products brand
will be dragged through the mud.

00:42:05.002 --> 00:42:08.297
But if you appeal directly to the public,

00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:11.383
you can create a perception of yourself

00:42:11.467 --> 00:42:14.345
as a woman who chose to work
through her husband's betrayal

00:42:14.428 --> 00:42:16.180
and mend her marriage!

00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:22.102
This could be your chance
to turn things around.

00:42:24.521 --> 00:42:27.483
Please. We need you.

00:42:37.743 --> 00:42:38.577
Well…

00:42:40.788 --> 00:42:44.667
Back then, when he told me
what had happened,

00:42:47.336 --> 00:42:49.380
I remember being very hurt.

00:42:50.714 --> 00:42:54.551
But we talked things out as a couple.

00:42:56.011 --> 00:42:58.347
And I have already moved past it.

00:42:59.973 --> 00:43:03.519
That's why we wanted to make things clear

00:43:04.144 --> 00:43:07.815
by telling you all what happened.

00:43:08.607 --> 00:43:10.818
That's why we called you here.

00:43:11.485 --> 00:43:13.445
Thank you all for coming.

00:43:17.324 --> 00:43:19.952
We'll take questions now if you have any.

00:43:20.035 --> 00:43:20.869
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:43:20.953 --> 00:43:22.871
Go with the Weekly Journal first.

00:43:24.873 --> 00:43:27.209
How about you, over there?

00:43:29.712 --> 00:43:32.881
I'm Fukumoto from Weekly Journal.

00:43:32.965 --> 00:43:33.924
I have a question.

00:43:34.007 --> 00:43:35.592
Sorry, I didn't notice you.

00:43:35.676 --> 00:43:38.554
Can I have your card? Thank you.

00:43:38.637 --> 00:43:40.556
Ms. Ninomiya, is it?

00:43:43.225 --> 00:43:44.977
Based on what your wife said,

00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:48.564
I take it that you immediately told her

00:43:48.647 --> 00:43:51.817
that you had spent the night
with that woman at the hotel?

00:43:54.945 --> 00:43:55.988
Is that correct?

00:44:04.955 --> 00:44:06.331
That is correct.

00:44:08.292 --> 00:44:14.590
I felt a strong sense of guilt,
so I told my wife as soon as I got home

00:44:15.090 --> 00:44:16.175
and apologized to her.

00:44:16.842 --> 00:44:20.262
And you two have already
resolved this between yourselves?

00:44:23.182 --> 00:44:26.393
Yes, that interpretation is correct.

00:44:26.977 --> 00:44:28.145
Thank you.

00:44:30.355 --> 00:44:32.691
We'll take another question.

00:44:33.317 --> 00:44:34.401
Next is Net Prime.

00:44:35.068 --> 00:44:36.945
You may ask your question.

00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:40.783
I'm Nakamura from Net Prime.

00:44:40.866 --> 00:44:47.456
While you were with that woman,
did your wife go through your mind at all?

00:44:51.502 --> 00:44:52.920
At the time,

00:44:53.587 --> 00:44:58.717
I was very drunk
and do not recall things clearly.

00:44:59.551 --> 00:45:06.099
However, I strongly regret
the thoughtless actions I took.

00:45:07.434 --> 00:45:09.102
I see. Thank you.

00:45:09.186 --> 00:45:10.103
Mori, you there?

00:45:10.687 --> 00:45:11.688
Yes.

00:45:11.772 --> 00:45:13.065
Post the comments.

00:45:13.565 --> 00:45:14.608
Roger.

00:45:17.402 --> 00:45:19.488
DIDN'T EVEN NEED
TO HOLD A PRESS CONFERENCE

00:45:22.866 --> 00:45:25.369
#KURYUFUJIWARA
SO THIS IS ALL JUST OLD NEWS?

00:45:28.288 --> 00:45:31.542
We'll take one last question.

00:45:32.042 --> 00:45:34.002
-How about--
-I have a question.

00:45:36.421 --> 00:45:38.090
I'm Hirata from Weekly Buncho.

00:45:38.757 --> 00:45:40.175
-What?
-Wait, what?

00:45:40.259 --> 00:45:42.219
-Well…
-Kagawa, end the conference.

00:45:42.302 --> 00:45:43.220
Actually, we--

00:45:43.303 --> 00:45:46.056
You say that nothing happened
between you and the woman,

00:45:46.557 --> 00:45:48.100
but is that actually true?

00:45:50.060 --> 00:45:51.353
Well, that's…

00:45:53.772 --> 00:45:55.691
Yes, that's true.

00:45:55.774 --> 00:45:57.067
How can you be sure?

00:45:57.818 --> 00:46:02.614
You just said your memory is hazy
because you were drunk.

00:46:02.698 --> 00:46:03.991
That's a contradiction.

00:46:10.831 --> 00:46:15.252
Do you really think the public
will accept such a vague explanation?

00:46:15.335 --> 00:46:16.920
That's right!

00:46:20.507 --> 00:46:23.385
What do we do?
The comments are getting heated too.

00:46:23.969 --> 00:46:25.262
Answer the question!

00:46:30.767 --> 00:46:32.102
Why…

00:46:35.939 --> 00:46:38.942
does it matter if the public accepts it?

00:46:46.158 --> 00:46:47.868
Pertaining to this issue,

00:46:50.037 --> 00:46:54.416
if you were to consider who,
if anyone, is the victim here,

00:46:56.293 --> 00:46:57.753
it would be me.

00:46:59.671 --> 00:47:04.092
And I trusted him
and accepted his explanation.

00:47:06.219 --> 00:47:08.972
If anyone deserves to judge Kuryu,

00:47:09.723 --> 00:47:13.477
it's neither the public nor you!

00:47:16.104 --> 00:47:20.942
By no means was it easy for me
to reach the point I'm at now.

00:47:22.444 --> 00:47:26.406
It was a struggle, but I pushed through.

00:47:29.117 --> 00:47:30.243
That's why…

00:47:31.328 --> 00:47:32.537
I'm requesting you…

00:47:34.539 --> 00:47:37.501
to not make it any more difficult.

00:47:40.587 --> 00:47:42.214
Please!

00:47:50.305 --> 00:47:54.267
Aside from spending a night
at a hotel with another woman,

00:47:55.519 --> 00:47:57.562
have you committed any other

00:47:58.855 --> 00:48:02.025
immoral acts that would betray
your loyalty to your wife?

00:48:15.205 --> 00:48:16.164
None.

00:48:17.999 --> 00:48:24.715
Nevertheless, what I did
was a betrayal of her trust.

00:48:26.550 --> 00:48:30.637
I plan to keep making amends for it.

00:48:32.848 --> 00:48:34.015
So please…

00:48:35.934 --> 00:48:37.728
give me a chance to do so.

00:48:49.489 --> 00:48:50.991
I have no more questions.

00:48:59.374 --> 00:49:01.418
SO RUDE
WHAT'S WITH THIS REPORTER?

00:49:01.501 --> 00:49:03.628
I FEEL BAD FOR MIREI
SHAME ON BUNCHO

00:49:05.255 --> 00:49:06.548
That's it?

00:49:13.054 --> 00:49:15.182
What was Hirata thinking there?

00:49:17.726 --> 00:49:18.935
CHEATING SCANDAL

00:49:19.019 --> 00:49:20.687
EMERGENCY PRESS CONFERENCE

00:49:50.175 --> 00:49:53.053
You did well. Thank you.

00:49:54.471 --> 00:49:56.932
I'll try to think of it as good marketing.

00:50:00.644 --> 00:50:03.605
We did what we could.
Let's wait and see what happens.

00:50:06.650 --> 00:50:08.485
Go get some rest. You did great.

00:50:09.152 --> 00:50:11.613
Okay. Thank you.

00:50:20.956 --> 00:50:23.667
That went really well!

00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:27.963
It did, though I did get thrown for a loop
when the reporter from Buncho showed up.

00:50:28.046 --> 00:50:31.383
This should weaken
the impact of the article tomorrow.

00:50:32.259 --> 00:50:34.594
I'll try to keep Fujiwara
in his drama role.

00:50:34.678 --> 00:50:35.887
Thank you.

00:50:36.596 --> 00:50:38.056
I'll call you later.

00:50:40.892 --> 00:50:42.227
Chief Ioka.

00:50:45.105 --> 00:50:47.148
That was an outstanding press conference.

00:50:49.442 --> 00:50:51.695
Sorry for ruining your scoop.

00:50:53.989 --> 00:50:55.615
I remember what you said

00:50:56.408 --> 00:50:59.244
about scandal articles
being retribution for entertainers.

00:51:00.370 --> 00:51:01.955
I disagree.

00:51:04.708 --> 00:51:05.917
It must feel so good

00:51:06.543 --> 00:51:10.255
to condemn others for their mistakes
while you get to be safe yourself.

00:51:11.423 --> 00:51:14.384
But I think it's just sad.

00:51:17.429 --> 00:51:22.601
I think the true immoral ones
are you tabloid journalists.

00:51:25.979 --> 00:51:30.567
In the press conference,
it was stated that

00:51:30.650 --> 00:51:33.445
there was no problematic conduct,
adultery, or otherwise.

00:51:33.945 --> 00:51:35.071
Is that correct?

00:51:35.655 --> 00:51:37.866
Yes, that is correct.

00:51:39.326 --> 00:51:40.660
Goodbye.

00:51:41.328 --> 00:51:45.665
The woman he was with
was 19 years old at the time.

00:52:02.933 --> 00:52:06.519
In other words, Mr. Fujiwara
was drinking with an underage girl.

00:52:07.062 --> 00:52:09.689
Would you consider that an immoral act?

00:52:14.527 --> 00:52:19.449
Thanks to today's press conference,
everyone's thinking about Kuryu Fujiwara.

00:52:21.743 --> 00:52:24.079
I wonder how it will be tomorrow.

00:53:52.625 --> 00:53:56.171
KURYU FUJIWARA DRANK
AND CHEATED WITH AN UNDERAGE GIRL

00:54:25.075 --> 00:54:31.498
WEEKLY BUNCHO

00:54:52.268 --> 00:54:53.311
PREVIEW

00:54:54.062 --> 00:54:55.855
-Three hundred million?!
-That's…

00:54:55.939 --> 00:54:57.690
We'll go under if we have to pay that.

00:54:57.774 --> 00:55:00.151
IOKA IS DRIVEN INTO A CORNER

00:55:00.235 --> 00:55:02.278
I don't think people want to see him…

00:55:02.362 --> 00:55:04.280
I shouldn't have let you coax me into it.

00:55:04.364 --> 00:55:06.157
I guess it completely backfired, huh?

00:55:06.241 --> 00:55:08.451
There might be one way to avoid it.

00:55:08.535 --> 00:55:10.453
WHAT IS THE ONE SOLUTION?

00:55:10.537 --> 00:55:13.748
If we can prove that,
we might avoid paying indemnities!

00:55:13.832 --> 00:55:15.291
I'm not happy about it either.

00:55:15.375 --> 00:55:18.044
I wasn't the one
who gave the pictures to the magazine.

00:55:18.128 --> 00:55:20.630
The one who sold the pictures
to Buncho wasn't Moeka Tanabe.

00:55:20.713 --> 00:55:22.048
Then who was it?

00:55:22.132 --> 00:55:23.800
A NEW MYSTERY SURFACES

00:55:23.883 --> 00:55:25.426
I feel like she's hiding something.

00:55:25.510 --> 00:55:26.261
No!

00:55:26.344 --> 00:55:27.971
Leave the Fujiwara story alone.

00:55:28.054 --> 00:55:30.890
Maybe there's a reason
he doesn't want you to dig deeper.

00:55:30.974 --> 00:55:32.642
DEEPER INTO THE SCANDAL

00:55:32.725 --> 00:55:36.312
You just don't get it, do you?

00:55:36.396 --> 00:55:37.438
What do you mean?

00:55:37.522 --> 00:55:39.190
SOMETHING BIG IS SET IN MOTION

00:55:39.274 --> 00:55:41.985
None of you people have any clue, huh?

00:55:42.068 --> 00:55:43.570
Let me tell you something juicy.

00:55:44.195 --> 00:55:45.822
We won't let things end like this.

00:55:45.905 --> 00:55:48.825
COMPENSATION, RESIGNATION, SLANDER

00:55:48.908 --> 00:55:52.996
WHAT CAN IOKA DO
TO TURN THIS PREDICAMENT AROUND?

00:55:53.079 --> 00:55:56.166
WHAT IS THE NEW MYSTERY?

00:55:57.167 --> 00:56:01.171
