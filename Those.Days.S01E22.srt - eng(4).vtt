=Those Days=

00:01:12.431 --> 00:01:14.800
(Adapted from iceread.com novel
"You Xi" by Qingyang Wanxi)

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.980
=Episode 22=

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.910
Zhidong is getting married.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.080
And now I've fallen ill again.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.800
Yes.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.440
Money has been really tight for me.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.350
What do you think, big brother?

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.880
I was thinking, I...

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:34.910
Could I borrow a little from you?

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:37.470
Jingxiang.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.830
It's not that I don't want
to lend to you.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.310
I...

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.440
It's just a bit embarrassing
to even talk about.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.800
You know our Yujun...

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.700
He didn't pass his exams.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.100
He can't graduate.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.740
So the whole family
is running everywhere

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.140
trying to raise money for his tuition.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.660
It really hasn't been easy.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.580
Then we'll just have to
think of another way.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:06.980
And what way do you have?

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:10.820
Think.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.860
If you can't find a way, make one.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.500
Tell me.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.380
Raising children...

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:19.900
What's the point?

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.580
You struggle so hard to raise a son,

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.620
and now the grandson

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.660
comes knocking to collect debts too.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.500
Big brother.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.140
He's your own grandson.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:31.900
How could you not help?

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:33.780
That's true.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.980
Alright, I won't talk your ear off.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.660
I need to get to the bank.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.460
I need to see whether
that investment of mine

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.420
can be withdrawn early.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:44.460
Wait, brother.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:45.740
Have a meal before you go.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.020
To be honest...

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.140
I really can't praise his cooking.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.900
Fine, brother.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:56.460
Slow down.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.780
It's alright, don't mind me.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:58.660
Alright.

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:59.460
I'll get going then.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.740
Alright, take care, brother.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:02.780
- Dacheng.
- Dacheng.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:03.900
Dacheng, I'm leaving.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.620
Dacheng, big brother is heading off.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:07.580
Have a meal before you go.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:08.900
No, I still have things to do.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.140
Make sure you look after Jingxiang.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.980
Don't worry, brother.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.260
Since Xiang was discharged,

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.020
aside from going to the toilet herself,

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.900
I've handled everything else for her.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.220
Dacheng, if you don't brag,

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.540
you'll feel uncomfortable.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.460
Alright, I'll go.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:24.540
Take good care of yourself.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.780
I'm off.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:27.740
Walk slowly, brother.

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.020
Give my regards
to sister-in-law and the others.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.140
Alright, I will.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.300
Your servant has prepared
a full Manchu-Han banquet.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.140
May Madam Yu
move to the Imperial Dining Hall.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.100
Please go for your meal.

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.180
Cheng Zi.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.780
Lead the way.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.820
Yes.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.820
It's raw.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:00.540
I didn't...

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.580
How did I forget to plug it in?

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.940
Alright.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:05.940
Let me do it.

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.060
Didn't your big brother
tell you to rest properly?

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.660
And your big sister said
you'd rise in rank and get rich.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.060
Did you get rich?

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.860
It's fine, let me do it.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.620
If I don't, we'll end up eating it raw.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:17.620
Alright, give it to me.

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:20.820
Your servant obeys.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.220
My mom has just recovered
from a serious illness.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.900
My dad has been cooking these two days.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:27.460
Whoever's hungry,

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.780
once they see his cooking,

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.100
they're instantly full.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:31.340
It can't be that bad.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:32.780
How could it not be?

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.940
Why else would I
spend money on takeaway?

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.620
If we didn't order it, we'd starve.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:38.570
I'm really not hungry.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.750
My appetite's been bad lately.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:41.740
What do you want to eat?

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.180
We can go out for a late snack later.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.500
I just want to eat you.

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.580
So cheesy.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.820
Dad.

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:53.620
Hello, uncle.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:55.460
Bichen is here.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.100
Smoke a little less.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.140
Where's Mom?

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.060
She's inside.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.180
Come on, go in.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.940
Mom, Chen came to see you.

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:05.580
Auntie.

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.980
Auntie, are you feeling any better?

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:13.820
Bichen.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.700
I'm still feeling alright.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.580
Just don't have any strength at all.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.540
I can't manage anything.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.980
Absolutely nothing.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:29.080
And you made so many dishes.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:30.140
This...

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.340
This doesn't look like
something my dad cooked.

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.340
I'm half dead already.

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.180
And I still have to serve you all.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.900
Can't you see I'm forcing myself?

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.860
Who told you to force yourself, Mom?

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.860
We never said we'd come back for dinner.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.260
Chen just wanted to check on you.

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.340
We already ordered takeaway.

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:47.820
Zhidong.

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.700
Your mom's condition recently

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:50.940
has been a little strange.

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.060
When she's doing well,

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.980
nothing's wrong at all.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:53.420
Exactly.

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:54.420
But when she's not,

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:55.980
she turns into this.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:56.620
Yes.

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:00.460
The main thing is,

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.300
I've got someone else's blood
running through me.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:06.300
Son.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.380
To be honest,

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:08.700
sometimes I think

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.260
I'm not even sure if I'm still your mom.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.700
She's talking nonsense again.

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.060
You'll always be my mom.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.220
She's rambling.

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:19.660
Bichen.

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:21.060
Auntie.

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:22.820
Do this for me.

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.260
Go home and tell your mom and dad

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.180
that with the way my body is now,

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:34.340
I'm afraid I won't be able
to get up anytime soon.

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.900
So I was thinking, the wedding

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:39.020
maybe...

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.020
We postpone it.

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:49.100
Postpone it?

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:50.860
Postpone it.

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.340
But the date has already been set.

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:54.140
Yes, Mom.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:55.340
Everything's settled.

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:56.660
Why postpone it?

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.020
How about this instead?

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.340
You two can get married first.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:04.700
And the ceremony

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:06.300
hold it later.

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:11.900
Mom.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:13.780
That's not how things are done.

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.150
You can't just change it like that.

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:16.780
When I left this morning,

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:17.660
didn't I ask you?

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:18.980
You said you were recovering well.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.220
You said you felt much better.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:21.900
What happened? Why now?

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.260
Calm down.

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:26.300
Chen.

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:29.340
- Chen.
- Bichen.

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:30.900
Chen, listen to me.

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:31.780
Move.

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:33.260
Chen, I really didn't know.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.740
How is she supposed
to explain this to her parents?

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:37.420
- Chen.
- She left crying.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:38.900
I know, I feel awful too.

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.060
What's going on?

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:41.060
The real question is...

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:46.900
Why postpone it?

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.660
How am I supposed
to explain this to her parents?

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:49.900
What's that attitude?

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:52.220
All you care about
is explaining it to your in-laws.

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:54.180
Why don't you think
about explaining it to us?

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:55.980
To get you married,

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:58.220
we emptied out everything we had.

00:07:58.220 --> 00:07:59.060
Do you understand?

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:00.540
Don't be ungrateful.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.580
If we'd known,
we should've sent you away.

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:03.580
Why didn't you?

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.020
You should've sent me away then.

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.020
Nonsense!

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:08.140
Xu Zhidong.

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:09.500
Let me tell you,

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.260
your parents are useless.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:12.140
That's just how it is.

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:13.420
If you want to get married, then marry.

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:14.460
If you don't want to, then

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:15.380
forget it.

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:17.100
Then I won't get married!

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:19.860
Zhidong.

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:21.300
Zhidong!

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:22.380
Zhidong.

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:23.380
I...

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:25.900
I...

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:30.260
Wait, what is going on?

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:31.660
I...

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:33.900
Dacheng, I...

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:42.180
Bichen is back.

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:43.580
Why are you back so soon?

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:44.910
You didn't go to Zhidong's place?

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:45.540
I did.

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:49.900
Why are you locking the door, Bichen?

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:52.180
Is Zhidong's mom feeling any better?

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:53.700
She is still lying in bed.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.340
So did you talk about the wedding?

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:57.460
No.

00:08:58.660 --> 00:08:59.340
Bichen.

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:01.060
You have to bring it up.

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:02.950
You can't keep dragging this out,
you're already pregnant.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:04.820
Honestly, child.

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:06.100
Why are you locking the door?

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:29.700
(Chen)

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:30.900
Sorry.

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:32.360
The number you have dialed
is currently unavailable.

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:57.980
Hello, Meiqi.

00:09:58.220 --> 00:09:59.020
Hello, Bichen.

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:01.640
Didn't you ask me to help you
choose your wedding dress?

00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:03.410
I've found
a great little wedding dress shop.

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:04.540
They have loads of designer styles.

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:05.460
They are really unique.

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:07.140
I...

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:08.460
Come on.

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:11.100
We can be inseparable in love,
and still be independent.

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:12.500
I'll send you the location, hurry.

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:26.740
You look so beautiful, Bichen.

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:30.100
You are the most beautiful bride
I have ever seen.

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:33.700
Really?

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:36.780
What is it?

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:43.500
I had a fight with Xu Zhidong.

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:46.420
I called him so many times,

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:48.660
and he just refused to pick up.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:49.660
That's outrageous.

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:51.580
You can always talk things through.

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.250
What kind of man
just refuses to answer the phone?

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:53.860
Come down.

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:04.660
Meiqi.

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:06.440
Actually, that day

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.750
when I sent you the photos
of me trying on wedding dresses,

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:11.820
I just wanted you to see

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:15.220
that even though I, Yuan Bichen,
may never leave Nanzhou,

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:19.060
I can still walk into a steady,
secure happiness.

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:22.700
But now it seems

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:24.700
that in this world

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:26.220
nothing is truly certain.

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:29.290
It's just Xu Zhidong
not answering your calls,

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:30.860
that's no reason to be this pessimistic.

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:32.340
Don't cry.

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:36.500
I'm pregnant.

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:41.420
The Xu family don't know yet.

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:43.140
My mom won't let me tell them.

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:45.060
Why?

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:48.740
She's afraid my in-laws
will look down on me.

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:52.380
I went to Zhidong's place today.

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:55.140
His mom said the wedding
has to be postponed.

00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:00.260
But I'm carrying a child now.

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.580
I don't even know
where things went wrong.

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.220
All I ever wanted

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:08.180
was to save money for his family,

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:11.540
and to build a good life with Zhidong.

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.940
But now he simply
will not pick up my calls.

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:17.180
Don't cry.

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:30.980
Your phone.

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:40.860
Did you know Bichen is pregnant?

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:47.700
She really is pregnant.

00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:59.580
Don't panic like that.

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:02.500
Bichen is a good girl.

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:05.020
This is clearly all good news.

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.180
You mustn't let anything go wrong.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:08.980
So you already knew about this,
didn't you?

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:13.260
Use my phone to call Xu Zhidong.

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:16.420
If he answers, then he's been
avoiding your calls on purpose.

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:26.180
Hello.

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:26.860
Xu Zhidong.

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:28.860
I called you so many times
and you never answered.

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:29.780
Yet you pick up straight away
when someone else calls.

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:30.740
What are you playing at?

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:31.460
No, Chen, I...

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:32.940
My phone just ran out of battery.

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:33.580
I don't care.

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:35.940
There is nothing more
for us to talk about.

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:39.700
Let's break up.

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:40.900
Hello?

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:42.100
Chen!

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:44.060
Breaking up is the right choice.

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:46.650
To be honest, there are things
I've wanted to say for a long time.

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.380
That family values sons over daughters.

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:50.060
They could even
abandon their own daughter.

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:51.850
You should stay as far away
from them as you can.

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:54.660
But I'm still carrying his child.

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:55.460
Bichen.

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:56.780
You need to think like someone strong.

00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:58.060
A mother has to be tough.

00:13:58.900 --> 00:13:59.820
Having a child or not

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:01.640
has nothing to do with
whether you break up.

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:03.980
If you and Xu Zhidong
really aren't a good match,

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:05.810
staying tied together
for life just because of the child

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:07.140
would only bring you endless hurt.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:09.300
Think of the child as well.

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:12.020
If the family is not happy,

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:14.060
the child's growth will suffer too.

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:15.920
Being a single mom
is not as hard as you think.

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:17.180
Chen, you...

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:19.420
I really did run out
of battery just now.

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:21.380
The phone was downstairs, I had no idea.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:23.300
I have only just found out.

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:24.380
Chen, where are you?

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:26.300
How did it get to breaking up?

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:27.180
Tell me where you are,
I will come to you.

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:28.820
Give me a chance
to explain face to face.

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:29.420
Alright?

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:30.300
Chen.

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:39.020
(Zhidong)

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:46.500
(Zhidong)

00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:58.750
This is my first time looking down
on Nanzhou from above.

00:14:59.060 --> 00:14:59.950
It is really beautiful.

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:02.140
Bichen.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:04.650
Have you ever thought about this?

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:07.540
When you stand at your doorstep,

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:10.020
all you can see is Xu Zhidong,

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:13.460
and the same life day
after day for decades.

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:16.580
But if you stand high enough,

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:20.180
you can see
a life full of possibilities.

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:22.820
How does that saying go again?

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:26.260
When you reach the highest peak,

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:28.340
the old city's view

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:30.140
fits in the palm of your hand.

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:41.460
Hello, Mom.

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:43.100
Feng Meiqi.

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:44.540
Where are you?

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.020
When are you coming home?

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:47.860
The whole family
is waiting to eat with you.

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:48.940
I am at Lijun.

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:50.900
My good friend just broke up,
she is upset.

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:51.860
I am keeping her company.

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:52.460
Auntie.

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.240
You don't need to
wait for me for dinner.

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:56.300
What time will you be back then?

00:15:58.100 --> 00:15:58.860
Hard to say.

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:00.580
Listen to me.

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:02.340
You must be home by ten at the latest.

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:04.460
Girls from families like ours

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:06.180
need to know their limits.

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:07.580
Got it.

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:16.420
Some things are easy to say.

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:21.800
Like the sea open for fish to leap,

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:24.140
the sky vast for birds to fly.

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:26.660
That is poetry.

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:31.140
All I can do is take the lift
to the forty fourth floor,

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:32.460
look out at the open sky,

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:34.860
then take the lift back down,

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:36.140
and go home to my mom.

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:37.940
That is reality.

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:44.180
Bichen.

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:47.260
Family love is a bond of care,

00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:49.260
but it can also hold you back.

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:53.420
If you do not want
to end up trapped like me,

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:56.900
you need to think carefully
about this child,

00:16:58.050 --> 00:16:59.440
whether you really want to keep it.

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:02.140
Look at Feng Meiqi.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.100
What has someone else's break up
got to do with her?

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:07.420
If she has that much time,

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:09.060
she should sort out her own life.

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:10.860
Mr. Hu is such a good man.

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:11.940
That young man,

00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:13.380
and she just leaves him hanging.

00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:14.950
She will push him away sooner or later.

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:17.660
Our daughter is grown,
she knows what she is doing.

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:18.740
Alright, our son is even older.

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:19.750
Does he know what he is doing?

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:33.300
Mingzhu.

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:35.420
How are the sales
of Rufeng Liquor lately?

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:40.220
Pretty good, Zhixia.

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:42.700
By the way, just now
when my mother-in-law

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:44.140
was on video call with Meiqi,

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:45.980
Meiqi said a friend of hers was dumped

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:47.460
and they were eating at Lijun Hotel.

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:49.060
I saw it was Bichen.

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:51.740
Bichen and Zhidong have broken up?

00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:00.060
Young people in love
are always like that,

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:02.020
arguing, breaking up and making up.

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:03.820
Xu Zhidong is a grown man.

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:05.100
He can date someone

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:06.820
without us waving flags for him, right?

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:08.420
It is fine, leave him be.

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:17.660
What happened with you and Bichen?

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:20.020
Chen wants to break up with me.

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:22.260
I do not know where she is.

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:23.180
I cannot find her.

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:25.140
Look at you, pathetic.

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:28.020
Bichen is at Lijun.

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:29.060
Go and make it up to her.

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:30.780
How do you know?

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:32.420
I worked it out on my fingers.

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:33.780
Alright, I got it.

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:35.540
Watch how you handle things...

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:43.980
Watch what exactly?

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:48.900
How's the job competition going?

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:54.620
Let's go to the supermarket.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:56.940
- Eggs discount.
- There's a discount on eggs today.

00:18:58.340 --> 00:18:59.500
Come on. Work's over.

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:00.740
Almost.

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:03.100
Almost. What are you writing?

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:04.820
There's a typo here.

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:08.060
Maodou must've written this.

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:09.780
Let's go, love. Quickly.

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:10.500
Almost.

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:11.140
Quickly.

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:12.420
Hurry.

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:13.700
Come on.

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:18.740
Has your mom been reading
military strategy lately?

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:20.820
How else would she use the grandson
to pressure the mother

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:22.140
just to cut the bride price?

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:24.540
A very accurate summary.

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:26.260
The director's chair
is practically yours.

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:27.060
Not necessarily.

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:28.380
It's guaranteed.

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:29.460
Eyes on the road.

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.140
So your troublesome brother

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:33.700
ran over there in a panic.

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:35.020
Will he manage?

00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:35.820
Who cares.

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:37.780
You may not care

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.860
but you'll be the one
cleaning up the mess.

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:48.220
Can't you drop me home first?

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:53.340
I really don't get it.

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:55.940
What did you even see in Xu Zhidong?

00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:58.620
I'm not as exceptional as you are.

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:01.700
I just want someone steady
to build a life with.

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:04.900
Xu Zhidong doesn't smoke or drink

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:06.540
and he barely talks.

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:10.860
But I just feel safe around him.

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:13.860
We often work late
at the cultural center

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:15.180
and he waits for me at the door.

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:17.180
He never rushes me.

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:19.100
When I finish work,

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:21.580
there's always
a warm milk tea in my hand.

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:25.100
It makes everything
feel steady and certain.

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:29.580
That is very sweet.

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:32.180
Which floor is the restaurant?

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:33.260
Fifth floor, sir.

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:42.380
It's getting late. Let's go.

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:44.220
Alright.

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:46.060
Don't think about anything
when you get home.

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:47.620
Take a nice bath and sleep.

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:49.900
I don't have a bathtub at home.

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:51.740
Then soak your feet.

00:20:59.140 --> 00:20:59.820
Chen.

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:01.060
Why are you here?

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:03.140
My phone really died.

00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:05.300
I wasn't ignoring your calls.

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:08.460
My mom found out you were pregnant

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:09.780
and she suddenly changed her mind.

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:11.700
I asked her why what she was thinking

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:12.860
and she refused to tell me.

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:13.900
What's she pretending for?

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:15.180
Your mom's too much.

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:17.580
Chen, I was wrong.

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:22.700
I get it.

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:23.900
Get what?

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:24.900
Isn't it obvious?

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:26.660
Bichen's carrying your child

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:27.740
and your family just turns cold.

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:28.620
Isn't that the truth?

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:29.980
It's really not like that.

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:31.820
So much for that steady happiness.

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:34.380
It's all a joke.

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:36.420
Xu Zhidong,

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:39.300
I'll make it clear right now.

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:41.020
I won't marry you.

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:42.420
And I won't keep this child.

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:44.140
Your family's door,

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:45.820
I won't step through it ever.

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:54.740
Then why didn't you tell me

00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:55.740
that you were pregnant?

00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:58.700
Why is it that everyone

00:21:58.700 --> 00:21:59.980
knew you were pregnant except for me?

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:01.340
Would it have made a difference?

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:03.100
You still listen to your mom.

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:04.660
You didn't tell me.

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:06.100
You didn't tell me!

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:07.460
How do you know it wouldn't matter?

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:10.540
Do you think telling me is pointless

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:12.500
or do you think I'm pointless?

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:14.100
Speak properly! Don't shout!

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:15.460
Didn't Bichen say it clearly?

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:16.500
She doesn't want this child.

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:17.220
She won't marry you.

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:18.060
Is that not clear?

00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:18.900
Can you stop talking?

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:19.500
No.

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:22.420
Are you even her friend?

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:25.340
Shouldn't a friend mend things
instead of breaking them?

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:28.020
I'm sure she wants to break up with me

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:29.460
because of your bad influence.

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:31.200
Are you scared
she'll live better than you?

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:40.380
Chen!

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:44.620
Let go!

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:46.900
Bichen.

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:48.940
Bichen.

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:50.100
Don't be angry.

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:51.940
Let go. Let go of her.

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:53.620
Bichen.

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:55.900
Zhidong is such a bastard.

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:57.660
I'll teach him a lesson for you.

00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:00.260
What are you doing?

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:01.980
You upset Bichen.

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:03.020
Why did you upset her?

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:03.700
You are?

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:05.420
I'm Xu Zhidong's sister.

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:06.300
Bichen.

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:07.660
Then you're also Mingzhu's sister.

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:10.460
I'm Mingzhu's sister-in-law.

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:15.420
So you're Meiqi.

00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:17.100
What a coincidence.

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:20.060
So we are all one family then.

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:26.380
Bichen.

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:28.180
Calm down.

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:30.260
On behalf of our family,

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:31.820
I apologise to you, alright?

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:34.460
Zhixia.

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:35.260
Don't cry.

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:36.500
Alright.

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:39.940
Xu Zhidong,

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:41.500
you idiot, do you hear me?

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:42.980
Are you an idiot or not?

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:45.100
Look at what you've done to her.

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:46.060
She's this upset because of you.

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:47.460
Don't cry now, don't cry.

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:50.820
Look at how upset you've made her.

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:53.340
She's carrying a child.

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:55.500
The child carries your surname,
you know that?

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:56.460
That's not certain.

00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:58.380
What do you mean not certain?

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:01.020
Meiqi isn't wrong.

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:02.540
When the child is born,

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:04.620
the child can take
the mother's surname too.

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:06.580
This isn't about
whose surname the child takes.

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:07.980
Bichen just said it,

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:09.460
she's not planning to keep the baby.

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:10.940
We should respect her choice.

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:12.300
I'm still the baby's father.

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:12.700
Not for much longer!

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:13.950
Shouldn't my opinion matter most?

00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:14.780
Xu Zhidong,

00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:16.180
get out.

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:16.900
Why are you talking so much?

00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:18.020
Go outside and wait for me.

00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:20.740
Meiqi,

00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:23.060
I know you're a good friend to Bichen,

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:25.860
you stand up for her
and speak up for her.

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:28.780
But she's angry right now,

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:30.700
so can we give her time

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:31.980
to calm down first?

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:35.620
It's rare for two people

00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:36.860
to end up together.

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:39.620
Our whole family has been preparing
to welcome her

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:42.300
running around full of excitement.

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:44.420
Renovating the flat
and buying furniture.

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:45.100
It hasn't been easy.

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:46.900
My parents are not young any more.

00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:50.260
So please go easy on them, okay?

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:50.860
Right.

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:52.700
It's hard marrying off a son,

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:54.300
much easier giving a daughter away.

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:02.860
That's an old problem
left over from the past.

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:04.900
Besides,

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:07.500
my parents have been trying their best
to make amends.

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:09.900
Meiqi, please believe me,

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:10.980
our family means no harm.

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:12.700
We truly want to treat Mingzhu well

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:14.100
and the same goes for Bichen.

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:15.300
Of course,

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:17.660
the condition is

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:19.860
that we don't burden them.

00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:26.540
Let Bichen think it over properly.

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:30.260
Bichen,

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:33.180
calm down for a bit, alright?

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:35.700
Don't make decisions while you're upset.

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:41.660
Let us take you home.

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:43.580
No need.

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:44.420
He's not coming.

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:46.060
I'll take you myself.

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:47.300
I'll go.

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:50.100
Bichen,

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:52.140
don't decide anything in anger.

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:21.460
Where's Chen?

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:23.900
Meiqi took her home.

00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:25.860
I don't need her help.

00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:28.060
Xu Zhidong, can you not be impulsive?

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:30.020
Of course she's angry.

00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:32.100
I'm pregnant too.

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:34.860
If Zhang Hao's family ever dared say
that just because I'm pregnant,

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:36.940
they can treat me however they like,

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:40.660
I'd get rid of the baby on the spot
and cut all ties, believe it or not?

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:45.100
Drive me home.

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:50.300
What?

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:52.450
Trying to fight for attention
with fake pregnancy?

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:09.580
Why are you having morning sickness too?

00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:11.780
I had a drink just now.

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:13.540
Unbelievable.

00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:14.780
It's fine.

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:16.620
My head isn't spinning,

00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:17.980
just my stomach feels off.

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:20.380
Are you alright?

00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:23.860
I'm fine.

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:25.820
I haven't eaten anyway.

00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:27.100
There's nothing to throw up.

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:29.740
Give me the keys. I'll drive you.

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:40.740
Why didn't you eat something?

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:42.420
I wanted to.

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:43.780
Did you give me the chance?

00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:46.140
My life right now

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:48.900
is more exhausting
than running a half marathon.

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:50.380
I'm dragging myself through every day.

00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:52.260
I didn't eat either.

00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:53.860
That's your problem.

00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:57.420
This is all Mom's fault.

00:27:58.420 --> 00:27:59.100
Mom's fault.

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:00.820
She let Bichen get pregnant.

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:05.620
Mom's been acting strange lately.

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:08.220
I keep feeling like she's hiding

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:11.300
some burden she can't put into words.

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:15.750
You don't think she's really trying
to save money on the bride price?

00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:17.620
Who would she save it for?

00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:18.580
For you obviously.

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:21.260
Maybe she even plans
to give it back to you.

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:25.700
Enough guessing.

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:27.300
It's late.

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:28.540
Mom just got discharged.

00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:30.860
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:38.060
Pull over, Zhixia.

00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:39.060
Pull over.

00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:41.980
Stop. Move further to the side.

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:49.100
You swallowed it.

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:51.340
There are cameras everywhere here.

00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:53.980
I just swallowed 100 yuan
and three points.

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:55.620
Do you know how hard that was?

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:06.780
Now I sort of understand

00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:09.460
how awful morning sickness
actually feels.

00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:12.700
Pregnancy is really tough.

00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:14.940
Mom has it hard,

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:16.340
you have it hard,

00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:18.860
and Chen has it even harder.

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:27.740
Let's go get some noodles.

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:33.820
It's outrageous. Absolutely outrageous.

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:35.140
I'm furious.

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:36.700
No wonder that family

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:38.460
kept dragging things
out again and again.

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:41.780
Turns out they realised
Bichen was pregnant.

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:44.700
When they said they'd give the bride price
on the day of the warming party,

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:46.180
I already suspected something.

00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:49.140
This family only plays
these petty tricks.

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:50.500
She hasn't even married in yet

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:52.220
and they're
already treating her like this.

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:54.240
If she marries over,

00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:56.580
how much will she have to swallow
for the rest of her life?

00:29:58.660 --> 00:29:59.340
No.

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:00.980
Absolutely not.

00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:03.660
Bichen,

00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:05.860
you must never have anything

00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:07.300
to do with that family again.

00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:08.820
Mom won't let you get hurt.

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:11.060
We can't keep this baby.

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:13.420
We have to end this pregnancy.

00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:14.220
Alright?

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:18.300
Chen,

00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:21.380
you're the apple of our eye.

00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:24.380
You and Zhidong
have always been good together,

00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:26.300
and I've always thought
he's an honest man.

00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:29.140
As for the things
their family did before,

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:31.260
I've let go of what I could let go,

00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:33.100
and I've compromised
where I could compromise.

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:34.020
But I will never allow

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:35.340
anyone to bully you.

00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:36.820
In this matter,

00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:38.860
the Xu family has gone way too far.

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:41.980
Alright, sweetheart.

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:46.180
Mom will register you
in a moment, alright?

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:49.660
Mom, I'm scared.

00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:52.620
Don't be scared.

00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:57.860
Don't be scared darling.

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:00.900
Mom's here.
You don't need to be afraid of anything.

00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:07.940
Jianqi,

00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:09.900
the baby kicked me again.

00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:12.140
He's really mischievous.

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:15.420
If it's a boy we'll call him Xiangru,

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:17.200
and if it's a girl we'll call her Yimo.

00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:18.180
I remember.

00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:20.420
But I want to give the baby a nickname.

00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:21.950
Let's call the baby An.
What do you think?

00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:23.580
An as in safe and sound.

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:27.020
Then it's settled.

00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:29.660
An's dad,

00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:31.100
I'm going to sleep now.

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:34.500
Is Mingzhu asleep?

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:35.540
No.

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:36.580
Come in.

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:39.740
Mingzhu, I'm telling you,

00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:42.100
you'd better keep your distance
from the Xu family.

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:43.500
They've crossed the line.

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:45.500
Their conscience has been eaten by dogs.

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:50.460
No... Back then they gave me away

00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:52.180
because they were desperate.

00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:55.860
Now that Bichen is pregnant,
they're trying to avoid the bride price,

00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:56.860
they're desperate too?

00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:58.140
This really happened?

00:31:58.140 --> 00:31:58.860
Yes.

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:00.540
Bichen just called me.

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:01.940
Her mom insists she go tomorrow morning

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:03.950
to the People's Hospital
to terminate the pregnancy

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:05.500
and cut all ties with the Xu family.

00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:07.060
I'm telling you,

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:09.180
I fully support Bichen's mom on this.

00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:11.580
But Yuan Bichen can't bear it.

00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:15.300
You should let them know.

00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:18.300
It's a life after all.

00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:21.980
Alright. I'll tell Zhixia.

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:25.180
Meiqi,

00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:27.340
you're sharp most of the time,

00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:29.180
but your heart is soft.

00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:34.540
I'm going.

00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:37.180
Hey,

00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:39.500
don't say I was the one who told you.

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:40.620
I won't.

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:42.020
I'd be glad if they broke up.

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:44.100
I can't stand Xu Zhidong.

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:45.580
Even if he's your brother,

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:46.550
I still can't stand him.

00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:00.980
Zhixia.

00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:02.180
Tomorrow morning,

00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:04.180
Mrs. Yuan is taking Bichen
to the People's Hospital

00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:05.020
for an abortion.

00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:07.300
Tell Zhidong about it.

I'm not feeling well today.

00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:34.340
Can we go another day?

00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:35.700

Bichen.

00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:45.860
Listen to your mother on this.

00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:47.660
Come on, get up.

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:49.220

Hello.

00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:11.020
Do you have buns?

00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:11.500
Yes.

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:12.860
Two meat buns and one soy milk, please.

00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:13.340
Alright.

00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:18.060
Hello, Zhixia.

00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:20.220
Don't worry,
I'm already at the hospital.

00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:22.340
I'll try to calm Bichen
and her family first.

00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:24.450
Whatever the issue is,
they should talk face to face.

00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:31.340
Xu Zhidong.

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:33.340
You've got your parents behind you,

00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:34.800
and your pregnant sister beside you.

00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:36.700
Can you please put safety first?

00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:39.060
Why is Chen acting so impulsively?

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:40.780
It's because of your mum.

00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:43.300
Because our family
didn't handle things well?

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:44.020
Calm down.

00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:45.460
Mingzhu is already at the hospital.

00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:46.140
Don't worry.

00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:05.100
Bichen.

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:06.820
Mingzhu.

00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:07.660
Hello, Auntie.

00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:08.300
You are?

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:12.060
I'm Xu Zhidong's twin sister.

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:15.740
So you're the girl
the Xu family gave away.

00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:16.340
Mom.

00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:17.860
My name is Shen Mingzhu.

00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:18.500
Come.

00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:19.350
Your surname is Shen?

00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:21.140
Uncle, Auntie.

00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:23.340
Please don't worry. Uncle, Auntie.

00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:25.940
Auntie.

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:27.260
Auntie, listen to me. Auntie.

00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:28.220
What do you mean?

00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:30.740
You already know about Bichen,

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:31.300
don't you?

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:32.300
What do you want to say?

00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:34.100
Please don't get upset first.

00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:35.180
Of course I'm upset.

00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:37.460
My daughter isn't even married yet,

00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:39.330
and his family
is already scheming against her.

00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:41.620
We are reasonable people.

00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:43.740
But the Xu family has gone too far,

00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:45.100
bullying my daughter like this.

00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:47.260
As her mother, I won't allow it.

00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:48.340
Uncle, Auntie.

00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:49.700
Please listen to me first.

00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:50.140
Mingzhu.

00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:51.100
Enough.

00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:52.020
We shouldn't talk

00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:53.100
about this here anymore.

00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:54.560
There's nothing to discuss with her.

00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:56.220
Her surname is Shen, not Xu.

00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:58.100
This has nothing to do with her.

00:36:58.340 --> 00:36:58.900
Let's go.

00:36:59.100 --> 00:36:59.900
No, Auntie.

00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:01.380
Don't push her. Mom.

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:02.660
Mingzhu is pregnant.

00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:03.740
Bichen.

00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:05.380
Xu Zhidong is already on his way.

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:06.380
Wait for him to arrive,

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:07.900
and hear what the Xu family
has to say, alright?

00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:09.250
What is Xu Zhidong coming here for?

00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:10.660
Tell him to get lost.

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:13.900
The Xu family really knows
how to scheme.

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:16.540
They are not even married yet,

00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:18.740
and they have already treated
my daughter like this.

00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:19.540
Fine.

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:21.260
Their Xu family looks down on us,

00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:22.580
and we are not worthy of them.

00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:23.780
Let me tell you,

00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:25.060
the wedding is definitely off.

00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:26.540
The baby will not be kept either.

00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:28.740
Didn't their Xu family
give away their daughter?

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:30.850
And now they force us
to get rid of our grandson.

00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:32.660
Let them find someone else if they want!

00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:33.540
Auntie,

00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:35.180
please calm down first.

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:37.900
If the Xu family
is really as awful as you say,

00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:39.380
then with my identity,

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:41.580
how could I still have the nerve
to plead with you?

00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:43.660
Your conflict with the Xu family

00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:45.180
is between you and them,

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:46.660
not us.

00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:48.620
But there is one thing we understand,

00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:51.020
they are not married yet,

00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:53.060
and my daughter
is already being treated like this.

00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:54.300
If they get married,

00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:56.380
will she still have a way to live?

00:37:57.100 --> 00:37:58.100
Will she?

00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:01.380
This has nothing to do with money,
this family is simply terrible.

00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:02.720
Their behaviour chills the heart.

00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:04.660
Even if my daughter never marries,

00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:06.300
she would never choose
a family like this.

00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:07.620
Enough, stop talking and let's go.

00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:08.100
Our number will be called soon.

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:08.780
Come on, let's go.

00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:09.820
- Mom, Dad.
- No...

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:10.180
I…

00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:11.140
Go now!

00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:12.820
Don't freeze up the moment you hear

00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:13.780
Xu Zhidong's name, okay?

00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:14.860
- Move!
- I…

00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:16.260
Go.

00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:17.020
Bichen,

00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:19.220
don't make such a big decision
so easily, all right?

00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:21.180
Isn't my daughter anxious?

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:23.980
Don't we feel distressed as her parents?

00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:27.620
But if the baby
is born without a father,

00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:28.540
isn't that pitiful?

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:30.660
Pitiful for what?

00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:32.980
How is it pitiful?

00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:34.820
This is a child,

00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:35.780
not an object,

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:37.140
and not a disposable thing!

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:40.740
Uncle, Auntie,

00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:43.260
you both know my situation.

00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:44.940
I was adopted.

00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:49.980
Even though I've lived happily
all these years,

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:52.980
I still can't help but wonder,

00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:55.420
why couldn't my birth parents keep me?

00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:57.100
Why did they have to give me away?

00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:58.740
Did they have no other choice?

00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:00.380
Did they have to give me
to someone else?

00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:03.660
Did they not feel any pain
for their own child?

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:06.420
After my husband passed away,

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:07.940
everyone told me

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:10.140
that raising a child alone
would be too hard,

00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:12.420
and that getting rid of the baby
would let me start over.

00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:15.060
But it hurt so much inside.

00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:20.100
And I doubted
whether I could be a mother.

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:24.260
I used to feel like
I was still a child myself.

00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:28.220
At night when I slept,
I didn't even dare turn off the light.

00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:30.780
How could I raise a child?

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:33.260
Feeding, burping,

00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:35.540
changing nappies, vaccinations,

00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:37.500
taking him
to the hospital when he's sick,

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:39.260
these are not even the hardest parts.

00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:41.580
What I fear most is later…

00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:44.100
When he grows up
and asks me where his dad is,

00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:46.180
what am I supposed to say?

00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:49.260
But he's already like a seed,

00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:51.220
and he's begun to sprout inside me.

00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:53.540
I really can't bear to lose him.

00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:54.980
(Outpatient Clinic)

00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:55.980
Uncle, Auntie.

00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:56.940
Chen.

00:39:57.300 --> 00:40:00.020
- I came early this morning just to wait for you.
- Bichen.

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:03.100
I just hope you
won't make a rash decision.

00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:06.340
Especially one that concerns a life.

00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:10.380
All right.

00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:13.660
Since your whole family is here,

00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:16.420
I'd like to hear your stance as well.

00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:19.740
Uncle, Auntie,

00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:21.820
I'm sorry.

00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:24.140
I…

00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:26.940
I've always listened
to my mum and my sister.

00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:27.860
I'm someone

00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:30.220
who has no mind of my own.

00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:32.900
From now on, anything about Chen and me,

00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:34.420
I'll talk it over with her,

00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:35.660
and we'll decide for ourselves.

00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:39.500
And the baby in Chen's belly,

00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:41.740
I'll take responsibility.

00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:43.060
I'll take responsibility for Chen.

00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:45.660
I'll never let her suffer again,

00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:47.180
and I'll never let her be hurt.

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:49.660
Please believe me, all right?

00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:51.780
No matter...

00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:52.980
No matter what,

00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:54.860
it's our fault.

00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:57.980
We'll take the blame if we must.

00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:04.580
Bichen's father, Bichen's mother.

00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:09.620
About this matter…

00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:11.740
I really am sorry.

00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:16.860
It's all because of the bride price.

00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:19.820
We were short ten thousand.

00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:22.740
So I came up with such a shameless idea.

00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:25.700
And… I spent the money.

00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:26.700
All my life,

00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:29.460
I've never handled such a large amount.

00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:30.780
Don't ask, please don't ask.

00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:31.860
Really, don't ask.

00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:33.100
Please don't.

00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:34.220
I'm begging you.

00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:35.780
I'm begging you.

00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:37.900
Bichen.

00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:39.140
Bichen.

00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:41.620
Bichen.

00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:42.980
Good girl,

00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:45.700
you've suffered so much.

00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:48.500
I truly am sorry.

00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:49.820
I'm really sorry.

00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:51.940
I'm sorry.

00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:56.620
I'm sorry.

00:41:57.660 --> 00:41:58.300
I…

00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:02.420
- Dad.
- Mum.

00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:03.180
I know.

00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:04.340
I'm sorry.

00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:06.100
Slow down.

00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:07.900
Slow down.

00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:17.180
Did the lady surnamed Wang
schedule the ultrasound?

00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:17.860
Did she?

00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:31.860
Call the nurse.
