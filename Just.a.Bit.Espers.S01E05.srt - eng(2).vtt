WEBVTT

00:00:13.243 --> 00:00:14.077
Bunty,

00:00:15.036 --> 00:00:15.954
touch me.

00:00:17.247 --> 00:00:18.456
Touch me.

00:00:19.165 --> 00:00:20.125
Again?

00:00:22.418 --> 00:00:24.462
Guess what I’m thinking!

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.383
We’re out of toilet paper.

00:00:30.051 --> 00:00:32.554
I can buy some,
but couldn’t you just say that?

00:00:32.637 --> 00:00:34.472
My back! Touch my back!

00:00:35.932 --> 00:00:37.725
Yo, can you hear me

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:39.978
Hear my vibe? Friend’s teaching

00:00:40.061 --> 00:00:42.897
Heart’s awakening
Did you catch the vibe?

00:00:42.981 --> 00:00:44.357
What vibe are you going for?

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:47.402
What about here?

00:00:47.485 --> 00:00:48.361
Just your fingertip.

00:00:48.444 --> 00:00:49.320
It’s the same.

00:00:49.404 --> 00:00:51.614
-Just a little.
-Even a little, I can hear it.

00:00:54.742 --> 00:00:58.037
Then, if we kiss, can you hear me?

00:01:04.419 --> 00:01:05.712
You heard it.

00:01:06.796 --> 00:01:07.755
No.

00:01:08.256 --> 00:01:10.049
-I can’t hear anything.
-Liar.

00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:11.426
I didn’t hear it.

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:13.553
Why not? Come on.

00:01:15.054 --> 00:01:16.806
I’m not doing it.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.183
Why not?

00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:19.309
Not in a place like this.

00:01:19.392 --> 00:01:20.643
But it’s your house.

00:01:21.269 --> 00:01:22.729
Everyone’s about to come.

00:01:23.313 --> 00:01:24.230
They’re not here yet.

00:01:27.525 --> 00:01:29.068
No!

00:01:29.152 --> 00:01:32.238
Don’t be stingy. C’mon.

00:01:57.847 --> 00:01:59.974
That’s for playing hard to get!

00:02:00.058 --> 00:02:02.560
Don’t toy with a man’s pure heart!

00:02:02.644 --> 00:02:04.771
You’re the one who rejected my pure heart.

00:02:08.316 --> 00:02:10.526
-I didn’t reject it.
-You didn’t?

00:02:12.445 --> 00:02:13.321
I didn’t.

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:30.213
‎Um… This isn't what…

00:02:31.381 --> 00:02:32.257
Welcome!

00:02:37.887 --> 00:02:40.348
‎TAKKOBI

00:02:40.431 --> 00:02:41.557
-Yeah!
-Yup!

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:45.478
Formerly the Microwaving Esper.

00:02:45.561 --> 00:02:48.523
Now the Electromagnetic Esper! Enjaku!

00:02:52.068 --> 00:02:53.695
-That's quick. Already 39 degrees Celsius.
-Wow!

00:02:53.778 --> 00:02:55.071
She's stronger with the remote.

00:02:55.154 --> 00:02:57.073
-And from that distance! Wow!
-Yeah!

00:02:57.907 --> 00:02:59.951
When you stroke it, flowers bloom.

00:03:00.034 --> 00:03:02.829
Flower blooming Esper, Ohsuke!

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.375
Thank you!

00:03:07.458 --> 00:03:09.002
Only can bloom flowers!

00:03:09.085 --> 00:03:12.130
-I'm Hanzo, the animal pleading Esper.
-Yeah!

00:03:14.382 --> 00:03:15.174
Please.

00:03:15.258 --> 00:03:16.217
Here it comes!

00:03:16.926 --> 00:03:18.594
-Here they come!
-Wait!

00:03:18.678 --> 00:03:20.388
Here they come!

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:24.976
-They landed!
-Wow!

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:27.145
Amazing!

00:03:27.228 --> 00:03:29.022
-That's what you call team work!
-Yeah!

00:03:29.105 --> 00:03:33.484
Read by touch!
The Esper that can read hearts!

00:03:33.568 --> 00:03:34.402
Bunta!

00:03:34.485 --> 00:03:35.945
-Yeah!
-The touchy type!

00:03:36.029 --> 00:03:37.447
Don't say that!

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:38.740
-Right?
-Stop it!

00:03:39.324 --> 00:03:40.908
Now…

00:03:40.992 --> 00:03:43.786
our star of the day! Shiki!

00:03:44.787 --> 00:03:47.123
-We were waiting for you!
-Yeah!

00:03:49.417 --> 00:03:52.628
I’m the Blow-Away Esper, Shiki.

00:03:52.712 --> 00:03:53.838
-Oh!
-Yeah!

00:03:53.921 --> 00:03:55.548
Great!

00:03:55.631 --> 00:03:58.718
When Bunty told me
that he and everyone else

00:03:58.801 --> 00:04:02.221
were secretly saving the world
with their powers,

00:04:02.305 --> 00:04:03.222
I was shocked.

00:04:03.306 --> 00:04:04.557
-Well, kinda.
-Yeah.

00:04:05.141 --> 00:04:07.352
Of course, I know it's a secret.
I won't tell anyone.

00:04:08.728 --> 00:04:11.689
All I can do is blow things away, but…

00:04:11.773 --> 00:04:14.192
-Everyone is just a bit Esper.
-Yeah.

00:04:14.275 --> 00:04:15.276
Yes.

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:19.489
While Bunty was away

00:04:19.572 --> 00:04:21.616
on a business trip,

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:24.035
I don’t remember much, but…

00:04:26.245 --> 00:04:28.122
Mrs. Enjaku was here…

00:04:30.041 --> 00:04:34.504
Ohsuke, Hanzo, and Sasuke

00:04:34.587 --> 00:04:39.217
also came to cheer me up.
I’m really grateful.

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:44.263
So, if my blow-away Esper power

00:04:44.347 --> 00:04:47.100
can help everyone,
I’ll be happy to use them for the team.

00:04:48.518 --> 00:04:51.229
-Come on. You’ve helped us plenty, right?
-Yeah.

00:04:51.312 --> 00:04:53.272
-Yeah.
-We wouldn’t even be here.

00:04:53.356 --> 00:04:55.191
You were a total jerk back then.

00:04:55.274 --> 00:04:56.150
Like you can talk.

00:04:56.234 --> 00:04:58.528
-Huh?
-Don't point at people.

00:04:58.611 --> 00:05:00.071
-Yes.
-But Mrs. Enjaku…

00:05:00.154 --> 00:05:03.157
-But…
-It’s hot, huh?

00:05:03.241 --> 00:05:04.409
I’ll cool us down.

00:05:09.038 --> 00:05:11.541
-So refreshing!
-Yeah.

00:05:11.624 --> 00:05:13.584
-So cool!
-Yeah.

00:05:13.668 --> 00:05:15.670
Didn’t know it could be used like this.

00:05:15.753 --> 00:05:19.424
From now on,
I’ll take better care of my breath.

00:05:20.091 --> 00:05:22.802
Garlic could be a weapon!

00:05:22.885 --> 00:05:25.638
-True.
-The Smelly Esper is born!

00:05:25.721 --> 00:05:27.640
-Huh?
-Don't say that to Shiki!

00:05:27.723 --> 00:05:29.016
Okay, here we go!

00:05:29.517 --> 00:05:31.477
-Everyone, strike a pose.
-Hurry!

00:05:31.561 --> 00:05:33.396
-What should we do?
-Three, two, one!

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:35.565
-Bit Five!
-Five?

00:05:37.859 --> 00:05:39.068
Bit Five?

00:05:39.152 --> 00:05:40.153
A little bit of five.

00:05:40.236 --> 00:05:42.321
I might’ve blinked.

00:05:42.405 --> 00:05:43.573
It's okay. It’s in burst mode.

00:05:43.656 --> 00:05:45.533
-Wait.
-I'll bring the cake.

00:05:45.616 --> 00:05:47.910
-Oh, yeah.
-I don't know.

00:05:47.994 --> 00:05:49.287
‎What does "Bit Five" mean?

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.205
‎Hey Sasuke. Okay…

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:54.584
Everyone, do you have a minute?

00:05:55.168 --> 00:05:56.627
‎Okay. Got it?

00:05:56.711 --> 00:06:00.214
Should we tell the boss about Shiki?

00:06:00.298 --> 00:06:02.592
We can’t really keep it a secret.

00:06:02.675 --> 00:06:04.802
We’ve already told her
about our Esper powers too.

00:06:04.886 --> 00:06:07.930
She’s practically family. Don’t worry.

00:06:08.014 --> 00:06:09.515
That blow-away type is strong.

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:11.225
Maybe the boss will be glad.

00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:12.185
-Yeah, right?
-Yes.

00:06:12.268 --> 00:06:14.395
So, when should we tell him?

00:06:14.478 --> 00:06:15.980
When he’s in a good mood.

00:06:16.063 --> 00:06:16.939
That’s crucial.

00:06:17.023 --> 00:06:20.443
Timing it right with your boss’s mood
makes all the difference.

00:06:25.156 --> 00:06:26.449
Message from the boss.

00:06:26.532 --> 00:06:28.951
Emergency meeting order?

00:06:29.035 --> 00:06:30.328
What a pain.

00:06:30.411 --> 00:06:32.246
First time he’s called everyone.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.290
Should we bring up Shiki
while we’re at it?

00:06:34.373 --> 00:06:35.458
-Good idea.
-But…

00:06:35.541 --> 00:06:38.044
His mood. Let's gauge his mood first.

00:06:38.127 --> 00:06:40.213
Is he ever in a good mood?

00:06:40.296 --> 00:06:41.797
He’s hard to read.

00:06:41.881 --> 00:06:42.798
I can tell.

00:06:42.882 --> 00:06:46.135
When he’s in a bad mood,
he gets wrinkles between his brows!

00:06:47.637 --> 00:06:49.889
Wrinkles between his brows?

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:01.567
Has anyone
noticed anything strange lately?

00:07:06.155 --> 00:07:09.200
I’m the Blow-Away Esper, Shiki.

00:07:09.283 --> 00:07:10.993
-Bit Five!
-Can we fit?

00:07:12.036 --> 00:07:13.913
Please give me psychic powers too!

00:07:13.996 --> 00:07:15.915
You can control animals, right?

00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.376
Mind if I touch your arm?

00:07:19.377 --> 00:07:20.670
That flower’s name is…

00:07:20.753 --> 00:07:21.963
Shion.

00:07:29.011 --> 00:07:30.137
I love you.

00:07:35.726 --> 00:07:37.186
Nothing at all.

00:07:39.188 --> 00:07:40.273
Nothing to report.

00:07:45.361 --> 00:07:48.364
Very well, then.

00:07:49.782 --> 00:07:52.827
I called you here
to discuss a special mission.

00:07:54.328 --> 00:07:57.498
You’ll be transporting a certain package.

00:07:58.416 --> 00:08:00.376
I can’t tell you what’s inside yet.

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:02.878
But this mission…

00:08:04.922 --> 00:08:07.049
involves human lives.

00:08:09.969 --> 00:08:13.264
Until the day comes,
suspend all other missions.

00:08:13.347 --> 00:08:15.224
Please prepare yourselves.

00:08:15.766 --> 00:08:16.934
That’s all for today.

00:08:18.227 --> 00:08:20.646
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:08:24.817 --> 00:08:25.860
Bunta.

00:08:27.445 --> 00:08:28.904
Please stay behind for a moment.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.617
-Just me?
-Yes.

00:08:51.218 --> 00:08:52.595
Is it about Shiki?

00:08:52.678 --> 00:08:55.181
If he finds out, we’ll just apologize.

00:08:55.264 --> 00:08:58.851
Shiki is the daughter of the person
who helped the boss, right?

00:08:58.934 --> 00:09:01.354
If he finds out we made her an Esper,
will he be angry?

00:09:01.437 --> 00:09:03.856
Yeah, that could happen.

00:09:03.939 --> 00:09:05.816
What’s the boss’s Esper power?

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:07.109
Huh?

00:09:07.193 --> 00:09:09.278
He must have something.

00:09:09.362 --> 00:09:12.490
-Now that you mention it…
-We’ve never heard of it, right?

00:09:13.866 --> 00:09:16.619
Maybe he’s a mind-reading type,
stronger than Bunta.

00:09:17.828 --> 00:09:20.706
He can probably sense things
without touching.

00:09:25.503 --> 00:09:27.880
About the current issue…

00:09:27.963 --> 00:09:30.383
The unidentified factor
we discussed before.

00:09:30.466 --> 00:09:32.635
You said you don’t know anything about it?

00:09:34.011 --> 00:09:34.970
That’s correct.

00:09:36.389 --> 00:09:37.682
As expected.

00:09:38.808 --> 00:09:41.769
The unexpected junction occurred in July.

00:09:42.812 --> 00:09:46.857
The problem occurred
before you even joined.

00:09:47.566 --> 00:09:49.235
Meaning you had nothing to do with it.

00:09:50.528 --> 00:09:51.362
Yeah.

00:09:51.445 --> 00:09:54.281
Please keep this matter
strictly confidential.

00:09:55.491 --> 00:09:56.409
Yes.

00:09:59.286 --> 00:10:01.247
What exactly is this "junction"?

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.332
A divide in the world.

00:10:04.208 --> 00:10:05.251
A branching point…

00:10:07.044 --> 00:10:08.087
you could say.

00:10:23.728 --> 00:10:25.020
Decision Tree.

00:10:26.105 --> 00:10:28.190
A vast dataset representing the world.

00:10:29.316 --> 00:10:33.571
Events in one place connect to others,

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.531
intertwining and branching out.

00:10:36.991 --> 00:10:38.492
From the past, through the present,

00:10:39.076 --> 00:10:40.953
and shaping the future.

00:10:41.454 --> 00:10:43.456
This Decision Tree

00:10:44.665 --> 00:10:47.251
represents our world itself.

00:10:48.961 --> 00:10:50.337
I…

00:10:52.131 --> 00:10:53.758
want to change the world.

00:10:55.676 --> 00:10:57.928
I want to change the future

00:10:59.221 --> 00:11:01.056
beyond the year 2025.

00:11:03.309 --> 00:11:05.019
That’s what our missions are for.

00:11:11.901 --> 00:11:14.111
Haven’t you ever wondered why

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.989
all the missions seem so meaningless?

00:11:17.072 --> 00:11:20.367
And why do they always happen
close to your own neighborhoods?

00:11:20.951 --> 00:11:21.785
Yes.

00:11:21.869 --> 00:11:24.330
It’s to minimize the range of impact.

00:11:24.413 --> 00:11:28.167
We accumulate small, indirect changes,

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:30.002
creating new junctions.

00:11:31.378 --> 00:11:33.130
From those new junctions,

00:11:33.714 --> 00:11:35.591
new futures are born.

00:11:38.636 --> 00:11:42.973
But the unidentified factors
are interfering with it.

00:11:43.849 --> 00:11:44.934
They…

00:11:46.227 --> 00:11:47.353
They…?

00:11:48.479 --> 00:11:50.564
-Are they humans?
-Yes.

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:53.025
A hero's enemy.

00:11:53.108 --> 00:11:55.361
They are Villains.

00:11:55.444 --> 00:11:56.570
Villains?

00:11:56.654 --> 00:11:58.697
Because of them,
we’ve fallen behind schedule.

00:11:59.573 --> 00:12:01.492
Small changes won’t be enough.

00:12:02.117 --> 00:12:03.953
We need a major shift.

00:12:04.578 --> 00:12:06.330
One that pushes everything
forward at once.

00:12:07.498 --> 00:12:08.541
Um, Boss…

00:12:09.208 --> 00:12:12.795
What kind of future do you want to create?

00:12:21.345 --> 00:12:22.221
How was it?

00:12:22.304 --> 00:12:23.138
Did he find out?

00:12:23.222 --> 00:12:24.557
Did he read your mind?

00:12:25.099 --> 00:12:25.933
Nothing happened.

00:12:27.685 --> 00:12:28.978
Well…

00:12:29.061 --> 00:12:31.814
He just said there’s still footage
of that commotion

00:12:31.897 --> 00:12:33.482
from the festival online,

00:12:33.566 --> 00:12:35.401
so we should avoid that area.

00:12:36.068 --> 00:12:37.987
-What?
-Huh?

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:41.073
-You worried me!
-Right?

00:12:41.156 --> 00:12:42.241
‎-Come on…
‎-Yeah…

00:12:44.201 --> 00:12:45.953
Ten years from now,

00:12:47.204 --> 00:12:48.706
10,000 people will die.

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:51.000
A major catastrophe will occur.

00:12:52.626 --> 00:12:55.129
I want to stop it.

00:12:55.629 --> 00:12:59.133
Ten thousand people will die?

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:00.884
Yes.

00:13:00.968 --> 00:13:04.346
That’s… more than a little.

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:05.723
Much more than a little.

00:13:05.806 --> 00:13:09.810
But we’re only "just a bit" Espers…

00:13:09.893 --> 00:13:12.229
I never said our missions
were "just a bit".

00:13:14.148 --> 00:13:16.692
The lives of 10,000 people in the future

00:13:18.068 --> 00:13:20.154
rest on your shoulders.

00:13:22.197 --> 00:13:23.532
Save those…

00:13:24.867 --> 00:13:25.951
10,000 lives.

00:13:28.287 --> 00:13:29.955
Little Bit Five.

00:13:30.039 --> 00:13:30.873
Five!

00:13:30.956 --> 00:13:33.167
Bit Five!

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:35.294
Just a bit… Oh!

00:13:36.629 --> 00:13:40.507
Just a little bit, right?

00:14:06.075 --> 00:14:07.201
Turning it off.

00:14:09.244 --> 00:14:10.079
Yeah.

00:14:19.588 --> 00:14:23.425
Today, something unbelievable happened.

00:14:24.885 --> 00:14:26.553
Something not so good?

00:14:27.763 --> 00:14:30.432
What I thought was just a local event

00:14:31.141 --> 00:14:35.604
turned out to be
a massive global project.

00:14:40.109 --> 00:14:44.863
I’ve never handled a job this big before.

00:14:47.199 --> 00:14:51.578
Everyone’s a beginner the first time.

00:14:52.079 --> 00:14:55.124
It's okay. You’ll succeed.

00:14:57.751 --> 00:14:59.753
Positive thinking.

00:14:59.837 --> 00:15:01.797
That’s who we are. Always positive.

00:15:04.675 --> 00:15:07.886
If I weigh as much as a pickling stone,

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:09.847
then I’m an exabyte.

00:15:11.098 --> 00:15:12.266
Exabyte?

00:15:12.933 --> 00:15:14.226
Yeah.

00:15:14.309 --> 00:15:18.731
Megabyte, gigabyte, terabyte, petabyte…

00:15:19.523 --> 00:15:21.650
Then comes exabyte.

00:15:22.401 --> 00:15:23.944
It means really heavy.

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.699
So, you're that heavy of a guy?

00:15:30.284 --> 00:15:31.285
Heavy, yeah.

00:15:32.369 --> 00:15:33.787
Someday,

00:15:33.871 --> 00:15:35.539
you might even get tired of me.

00:15:38.125 --> 00:15:40.044
If we’re both heavy,

00:15:40.127 --> 00:15:42.880
we don’t need to worry about being hated.

00:15:42.963 --> 00:15:45.382
From now on, we can be sure

00:15:45.466 --> 00:15:47.968
that we’ll always be there for each other.

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:51.513
We can both live positively.

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:57.186
That’s what we said…?

00:15:59.605 --> 00:16:00.773
Didn’t we?

00:16:01.482 --> 00:16:02.816
We made that promise, right?

00:16:11.241 --> 00:16:14.995
Even if the big project fails
and you lose your job,

00:16:15.621 --> 00:16:17.331
I’ll take care of you.

00:16:20.793 --> 00:16:23.879
So, don’t worry and sleep well.

00:16:25.964 --> 00:16:27.091
‎Okay.

00:16:27.841 --> 00:16:28.967
‎Good night.

00:16:55.452 --> 00:16:56.453
You're in the way.

00:16:57.996 --> 00:16:59.832
You know about Shiki’s ex-husband?

00:17:01.083 --> 00:17:02.084
Don't know.

00:17:02.167 --> 00:17:04.795
Is he older? Younger?
What kind of guy was he?

00:17:04.878 --> 00:17:05.879
I said I don’t know!

00:17:06.505 --> 00:17:07.756
What’s your problem?

00:17:09.383 --> 00:17:14.138
Shiki really
loves her husband with all her heart.

00:17:14.805 --> 00:17:16.098
Me.

00:17:16.723 --> 00:17:18.016
Is this you bragging?

00:17:20.144 --> 00:17:22.396
I’m pretending to be her dead husband.

00:17:23.021 --> 00:17:25.566
Is it really okay for me
to keep accepting her love?

00:17:27.276 --> 00:17:29.820
You’re saying dumb stuff again.

00:17:30.904 --> 00:17:32.531
If she never finds out, it’s fine!

00:17:33.532 --> 00:17:36.451
Ohsuke. Stop with that criminal mindset.

00:17:36.535 --> 00:17:40.330
Shiki’s happier when you’re around.
That’s enough.

00:17:42.624 --> 00:17:44.042
Keep lying to her.

00:17:44.126 --> 00:17:46.253
Keep hiding it desperately.

00:17:47.337 --> 00:17:49.173
You don’t understand.

00:17:51.842 --> 00:17:52.885
Morning.

00:17:52.968 --> 00:17:53.802
Morning.

00:17:53.886 --> 00:17:55.137
Have a good day.

00:17:59.224 --> 00:18:00.267
Hey!

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:02.603
-Does he know you're his dad?
-Dummy.

00:18:02.686 --> 00:18:04.771
Like I’d tell him.

00:18:04.855 --> 00:18:07.232
I’m just the florist guy.

00:18:08.066 --> 00:18:09.776
A random musclehead.

00:18:11.111 --> 00:18:13.530
I’ll hide it with everything I’ve got.

00:18:13.614 --> 00:18:17.034
I’ll stay the florist guy till I die.

00:18:18.118 --> 00:18:19.620
I’ll keep fooling him.

00:18:22.915 --> 00:18:25.209
So, you better hang in there too.

00:18:31.423 --> 00:18:33.425
-Great work. Thanks.
-Thanks.

00:18:34.092 --> 00:18:35.052
Yes.

00:18:35.135 --> 00:18:36.386
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

00:18:38.597 --> 00:18:39.848
SKEWERED MOCHI

00:18:39.932 --> 00:18:41.934
It arrived. Thank you.

00:18:45.062 --> 00:18:46.813
What are you worried about?

00:18:48.482 --> 00:18:49.524
Exactly.

00:18:50.692 --> 00:18:55.072
Bunty bought me
a bee necklace for my birthday.

00:18:55.697 --> 00:18:56.782
Bunty?

00:18:56.865 --> 00:18:58.033
Yeah.

00:18:58.116 --> 00:19:00.994
Who are you talking about?

00:19:13.298 --> 00:19:14.716
I got another remote.

00:19:15.342 --> 00:19:16.343
For the TV?

00:19:16.426 --> 00:19:18.470
Any remote works, really.

00:19:18.553 --> 00:19:20.347
I don’t even need to press the buttons,

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:22.349
but pressing helps me focus my energy,

00:19:22.432 --> 00:19:24.434
so my Esper powers reach farther.

00:19:28.355 --> 00:19:29.815
Looks nice.

00:19:33.527 --> 00:19:36.947
You know, today,
when I told my dad about Bunty,

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:39.324
he asked, "Who’s that?"

00:19:39.908 --> 00:19:43.412
A customer came by,
so I said bye and hung up,

00:19:44.204 --> 00:19:46.039
but it felt weird.

00:19:48.834 --> 00:19:52.754
When Bunta was away on his business trip,

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:55.924
your dad probably got mad
that you were left alone,

00:19:56.008 --> 00:19:58.510
which gave him a bad impression of Bunta.

00:19:59.219 --> 00:20:02.931
Then maybe I should explain.
It’s not Bunty's fault.

00:20:03.682 --> 00:20:05.142
His work changed.

00:20:12.232 --> 00:20:15.444
Wait. Was that trip for his handyman job?

00:20:16.945 --> 00:20:18.572
Or the previous company?

00:20:23.869 --> 00:20:25.454
Maybe it’s best not to tell your dad.

00:20:26.955 --> 00:20:30.292
Let’s not. I don’t think
Bunta would want that either.

00:20:31.752 --> 00:20:33.253
You’re happy now, right?

00:20:33.337 --> 00:20:36.214
With Bunta and us together?

00:20:36.798 --> 00:20:38.759
Your dad lives far away anyway.

00:20:38.842 --> 00:20:41.678
You’ve got your own life now, Shiki.

00:20:44.389 --> 00:20:45.390
That's right.

00:20:49.895 --> 00:20:51.271
How is it recently?

00:20:52.647 --> 00:20:54.399
Have you been having that dream lately?

00:20:56.777 --> 00:20:59.112
Now that you mention it, no.

00:21:04.368 --> 00:21:06.078
It's a strange dream, isn't it?

00:21:06.745 --> 00:21:08.580
Bunty's alive and healthy, after all.

00:21:09.664 --> 00:21:12.667
Yeah… Let’s just forget it.

00:21:15.879 --> 00:21:19.383
When we tell the boss about your powers,

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:24.721
will he tell your dad, too?

00:21:25.597 --> 00:21:27.015
Why my dad?

00:21:27.099 --> 00:21:31.144
Isn’t the boss the president of Nonamare?

00:21:31.228 --> 00:21:32.646
Yeah, but…

00:21:39.444 --> 00:21:42.322
Oh, it's okay. I was mistaken.

00:21:42.406 --> 00:21:43.949
Here. It’s hot.

00:21:45.325 --> 00:21:46.493
Let's eat.

00:21:49.204 --> 00:21:52.040
Sweet and salty. Delicious.

00:21:52.124 --> 00:21:53.750
Glad you like it.

00:21:53.834 --> 00:21:57.170
It sticks to your teeth, doesn't it?

00:21:57.838 --> 00:21:58.672
Want some daikon radish?

00:21:59.297 --> 00:22:00.674
Let's eat.

00:22:08.056 --> 00:22:14.312
I thought…
you and Shiki’s father were friends.

00:22:14.813 --> 00:22:19.901
That's why I was asked to look after her.
Was I mistaken?

00:22:21.736 --> 00:22:22.904
Due to certain circumstances,

00:22:23.697 --> 00:22:27.450
someone else asked me
to keep an eye on her.

00:22:27.534 --> 00:22:29.661
It wasn’t her father.

00:22:30.871 --> 00:22:33.206
I see.

00:22:34.249 --> 00:22:37.043
My apologies for the misunderstanding.

00:22:37.127 --> 00:22:40.338
If caring for Shiki is too burdensome,

00:22:40.422 --> 00:22:41.965
I can assign someone else.

00:22:42.048 --> 00:22:45.260
Oh, not at all! Shiki’s so sweet.

00:22:45.343 --> 00:22:48.471
She actually takes care of me
most of the time.

00:22:51.099 --> 00:22:52.184
I’m…

00:22:53.727 --> 00:22:55.604
grateful to you, Boss.

00:22:56.646 --> 00:22:58.899
For giving me a third life.

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:04.487
Back then…

00:23:09.409 --> 00:23:10.493
Nice to meet you.

00:23:11.036 --> 00:23:13.079
I’m Kizashi from Nonamare.

00:23:14.581 --> 00:23:17.125
From the support facility?

00:23:18.293 --> 00:23:21.463
-I don’t need help.
-No,

00:23:21.546 --> 00:23:22.756
I’m a recruiter.

00:23:23.924 --> 00:23:25.425
Would you like to work for us?

00:23:39.439 --> 00:23:41.858
You used to be an excellent secretary.

00:23:41.942 --> 00:23:45.028
But you embezzled company funds.
Convicted of fraud

00:23:45.862 --> 00:23:49.241
and forgery of official documents,
you got ten years in prison.

00:23:51.368 --> 00:23:52.410
Are you…

00:23:54.663 --> 00:23:56.456
Yuuki’s subordinate?

00:23:58.625 --> 00:23:59.584
You’ve got…

00:24:01.836 --> 00:24:04.464
You've got some nerve showing your face!

00:24:05.799 --> 00:24:08.051
Why should I be the one turning myself in?

00:24:08.551 --> 00:24:10.804
Because you’re the one who did it.

00:24:11.554 --> 00:24:13.556
Only because you told me to.

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:17.185
The condo, the jewelry, the designer bags.

00:24:17.269 --> 00:24:19.479
You lived the high life, didn’t you?

00:24:19.562 --> 00:24:21.856
Those were gifts from you!

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:23.817
You said you couldn’t leave your wife,

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:26.903
and that they were
to make up for the loneliness.

00:24:26.987 --> 00:24:29.114
I know!

00:24:31.908 --> 00:24:36.538
When you get out,
we’ll finally be happy together.

00:24:36.621 --> 00:24:37.789
Get out of here!

00:24:38.623 --> 00:24:40.500
Don't ever come back!

00:24:41.626 --> 00:24:42.627
I’m sorry.

00:24:43.545 --> 00:24:45.046
I have no ties to Yuuki.

00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:49.592
But…

00:24:50.468 --> 00:24:51.845
I know what happened.

00:24:56.141 --> 00:24:59.394
You took all the blame
and served the time.

00:25:01.146 --> 00:25:03.398
He never visited you once.

00:25:12.032 --> 00:25:14.451
I was such a fool.

00:25:15.869 --> 00:25:17.287
That’s why…

00:25:18.038 --> 00:25:20.582
I'm spending my second life here.

00:25:24.002 --> 00:25:25.837
All that’s left is to die.

00:25:27.088 --> 00:25:27.922
Leave me alone.

00:25:28.006 --> 00:25:29.758
Would you like to begin…

00:25:31.509 --> 00:25:32.635
your third life?

00:25:37.849 --> 00:25:39.059
There’s

00:25:40.018 --> 00:25:41.269
a capsule inside.

00:25:42.604 --> 00:25:43.480
Drink it,

00:25:44.481 --> 00:25:45.899
and your life will change.

00:25:47.108 --> 00:25:50.236
Your future begins here.

00:25:57.452 --> 00:25:59.704
Nicely done!

00:26:00.413 --> 00:26:03.083
Will I get scolded? I’ll pick it up later.

00:26:07.629 --> 00:26:08.755
You know…

00:26:09.339 --> 00:26:10.298
Yeah.

00:26:10.382 --> 00:26:12.175
There was a man I wanted to kill.

00:26:19.391 --> 00:26:21.059
I met him when I was 25,

00:26:23.144 --> 00:26:25.688
and until I was 60… For 35 years…

00:26:29.234 --> 00:26:31.945
For 35 years, I was devoted to him.

00:26:36.282 --> 00:26:38.368
He deceived me, abandoned me,

00:26:40.161 --> 00:26:43.790
and made me taste humiliation
down to my very bones.

00:26:47.752 --> 00:26:49.712
In my jail cell, all I thought about was…

00:26:52.549 --> 00:26:54.217
how to kill him.

00:26:56.511 --> 00:26:58.054
That’s all I could think of!

00:27:03.059 --> 00:27:04.477
I’ll kill him!

00:27:05.437 --> 00:27:06.896
Once I get out of here!

00:27:08.189 --> 00:27:09.274
Mrs. Enjaku.

00:27:11.443 --> 00:27:14.654
And after I kill him, I’ll die too.

00:27:19.367 --> 00:27:22.120
Then it wouldn’t be just 35 years.

00:27:23.621 --> 00:27:26.624
I’d be giving my whole life to him.

00:27:32.922 --> 00:27:34.174
It’s ridiculous.

00:27:35.508 --> 00:27:36.968
It’s ridiculous.

00:27:43.725 --> 00:27:44.767
We…

00:27:46.269 --> 00:27:47.770
make a good team, don’t we?

00:27:52.192 --> 00:27:56.446
I’m glad
you decided not to go through with it.

00:28:00.617 --> 00:28:03.745
Let’s do our best on the special mission.

00:28:08.374 --> 00:28:10.126
We’ve got a world to save!

00:28:11.544 --> 00:28:12.462
Right.

00:28:21.554 --> 00:28:22.972
Nice!

00:28:26.059 --> 00:28:27.393
DAIBA MALL

00:28:30.647 --> 00:28:32.232
The mission this time…

00:28:32.315 --> 00:28:36.694
At the Daiba Mall in Odaiba,
a blue attaché case

00:28:37.278 --> 00:28:38.863
will be handed over to an organization.

00:28:38.947 --> 00:28:40.281
Please steal it.

00:28:40.782 --> 00:28:44.786
Go to the nearest sea and sink it there.

00:28:45.453 --> 00:28:48.164
Even if you steal it,
they won't call the police.

00:28:48.915 --> 00:28:51.751
They can’t report it
to the authorities anyway.

00:28:52.544 --> 00:28:56.089
Never take the case on public transport.

00:28:56.965 --> 00:29:00.009
-Why not?
-Because you’re heroes.

00:29:00.677 --> 00:29:02.262
That's how it'll be.

00:29:02.345 --> 00:29:04.180
What organization is it?

00:29:04.264 --> 00:29:05.557
Yakuza.

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:07.433
We're fighting against organized crime?

00:29:07.517 --> 00:29:09.018
There are many kinds of organizations.

00:29:09.102 --> 00:29:11.354
If it's an organization,
it has to be the Yakuza.

00:29:11.437 --> 00:29:12.772
What’s inside that case?

00:29:12.856 --> 00:29:15.400
He never tells us. He's so stingy.

00:29:15.483 --> 00:29:17.569
Maybe he can’t tell us yet.

00:29:18.987 --> 00:29:20.280
I asked before.

00:29:20.864 --> 00:29:24.742
Why can’t we know
the mission details sooner?

00:29:25.368 --> 00:29:29.122
Once you know,
change begins at that moment.

00:29:29.956 --> 00:29:31.666
The earlier it starts,

00:29:31.749 --> 00:29:34.836
the greater the risk of deviation.

00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:38.631
So, we keep things untouched
until the last possible moment.

00:29:40.091 --> 00:29:43.720
It’s like Schrödinger’s cat.

00:29:44.554 --> 00:29:46.139
I see…

00:29:46.723 --> 00:29:47.557
What's that?

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:49.475
-I don’t really know either.
-Explain.

00:29:50.685 --> 00:29:52.604
Let’s just pretend we get it and move on.

00:29:54.188 --> 00:29:56.399
Why do you think
he want us to sink it in the sea?

00:29:56.482 --> 00:29:59.360
The case has drugs! Saltwater ruins them!

00:29:59.444 --> 00:30:02.113
So, that’s why
we can’t take public transport?

00:30:02.196 --> 00:30:04.115
If we get caught holding it,
we’ll get arrested!

00:30:04.198 --> 00:30:05.700
It's definitely organized crime!

00:30:05.783 --> 00:30:08.578
Stop jumping to the worst conclusions!

00:30:08.661 --> 00:30:11.331
-Should I make some flowers bloom?
-Not now!

00:30:13.833 --> 00:30:16.044
Bit…

00:30:16.127 --> 00:30:20.173
Bit Five minus one!

00:30:20.256 --> 00:30:21.841
DAIBA MALL

00:30:39.442 --> 00:30:40.902
-It came!
-It came!

00:30:40.985 --> 00:30:42.362
SP MISSION

00:30:42.445 --> 00:30:44.238
SP. Special mission.

00:30:44.322 --> 00:30:46.449
It feels special!

00:30:46.532 --> 00:30:47.492
SPECIAL MISSION

00:30:47.575 --> 00:30:49.577
STEAL THE BLUE ATTACHÉ CASE AND STOP
THE VIRUS ATTACK. TIME LIMIT - 20 MINUTES

00:30:49.661 --> 00:30:52.163
Stop the virus attack?

00:30:53.164 --> 00:30:56.542
You mean there’s a deadly virus in there?

00:30:56.626 --> 00:30:58.127
What are you doing?!

00:30:58.211 --> 00:31:01.506
-A 20-minute limit!
-If time runs out, the case goes boom!

00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:07.971
He's leaving the case.

00:31:17.021 --> 00:31:19.107
They're the perpetrators.

00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:20.984
Before they spread the virus…

00:31:21.067 --> 00:31:22.652
We grab the case…

00:31:22.735 --> 00:31:24.112
And sink it in the sea.

00:31:25.071 --> 00:31:27.407
Stick to the plan. Okay?

00:31:34.205 --> 00:31:36.666
Hot water, anyone?

00:31:36.749 --> 00:31:40.211
This one’s 39 degrees Celsius,
and this one’s 36 degrees Celsius.

00:31:40.294 --> 00:31:44.632
They're barely different,
but which do you--

00:31:47.969 --> 00:31:49.095
See you!

00:31:49.178 --> 00:31:50.638
-Wait!
-Wait!

00:31:50.722 --> 00:31:51.556
First?

00:31:51.639 --> 00:31:52.515
Grab it by force.

00:31:52.598 --> 00:31:54.517
Then they’ll chase us, right?

00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:56.185
If we get caught, we’ll beat them up.

00:31:56.269 --> 00:31:57.770
We'll get reported to the cops.

00:31:57.854 --> 00:32:00.732
You think we can outrun them to the sea?

00:32:00.815 --> 00:32:02.066
If I had serious stamina…

00:32:02.150 --> 00:32:03.109
I don't…

00:32:03.192 --> 00:32:04.360
You don't?

00:32:05.278 --> 00:32:07.739
Then, let’s do it as a three-person relay.

00:32:11.492 --> 00:32:12.535
‎Alright!

00:32:15.163 --> 00:32:16.873
Wait!

00:32:21.961 --> 00:32:23.880
Can we use a taxi?

00:32:23.963 --> 00:32:26.424
The boss said not to take
the case on public transport.

00:32:26.507 --> 00:32:28.051
But people can ride, right?

00:32:28.968 --> 00:32:30.261
We’ll all meet here…

00:32:31.012 --> 00:32:32.430
in the end.

00:32:57.121 --> 00:32:58.664
He's late.

00:33:04.796 --> 00:33:05.755
Hanzo!

00:33:07.715 --> 00:33:09.342
-You okay? What happened?
-Go!

00:33:10.802 --> 00:33:11.969
Leave the rest to me!

00:33:16.682 --> 00:33:17.683
Alright.

00:33:23.356 --> 00:33:24.190
‎Jeez…

00:33:30.279 --> 00:33:31.447
‎I can't stop crying!

00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:35.451
Don’t cry!

00:33:42.041 --> 00:33:44.919
-That guy is crying!
-Bunty?

00:33:45.002 --> 00:33:48.464
-Yeah!
-You're right!

00:33:49.090 --> 00:33:50.216
What is this?

00:33:51.384 --> 00:33:52.885
Am I going to die?

00:33:59.892 --> 00:34:01.394
Bunta? What's wrong?

00:34:02.145 --> 00:34:03.771
-What's wrong?
-Hey.

00:34:05.064 --> 00:34:06.941
Oh, later!

00:34:16.826 --> 00:34:18.995
Bunta!

00:34:20.872 --> 00:34:21.873
Over here!

00:34:26.961 --> 00:34:28.171
No problem!

00:34:35.636 --> 00:34:36.637
Alright.

00:34:39.807 --> 00:34:42.018
This won't sink.

00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:44.562
If…

00:34:46.772 --> 00:34:48.024
Hello.

00:34:50.193 --> 00:34:51.235
What are you doing here?

00:34:53.112 --> 00:34:55.114
Give me that case.

00:34:57.158 --> 00:34:58.784
Quickly give it to me.

00:35:01.329 --> 00:35:02.622
Thank you.

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:08.711
Who is Ohsuke talking to?

00:35:08.794 --> 00:35:09.879
A student uniform?

00:35:12.673 --> 00:35:14.175
I thought you saved me

00:35:14.258 --> 00:35:16.928
in that explosion
during the summer festival.

00:35:18.095 --> 00:35:19.805
I’m disappointed that it was all staged.

00:35:23.059 --> 00:35:24.560
Hurry up and give me the case.

00:35:26.479 --> 00:35:27.939
-It’s dangerous.
-What is?

00:35:28.022 --> 00:35:29.148
There’s a killer virus.

00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:32.526
-So--
-The dangerous ones are you villains!

00:35:37.823 --> 00:35:38.824
Yeah! I got it!

00:35:43.788 --> 00:35:44.747
It's you!

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:47.166
‎Why? Hey!

00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:49.377
-Let go! Give it to me!
-Hurry!

00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:50.628
-Give it to me!
-Shion!

00:35:57.051 --> 00:35:58.761
-I'm moving.
-Wait!

00:35:59.845 --> 00:36:00.763
Move, old man!

00:36:02.682 --> 00:36:04.183
Dammit!

00:36:11.649 --> 00:36:12.400
Another one.

00:36:19.657 --> 00:36:21.117
-No use. It's not moving.
-Hey!

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:22.535
Let's escape!

00:36:23.119 --> 00:36:23.953
Shion!

00:36:28.499 --> 00:36:29.417
Over here!

00:36:30.459 --> 00:36:31.544
Wait!

00:36:33.212 --> 00:36:34.046
Huh?

00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:35.589
-Oh no!
-Here?

00:36:35.673 --> 00:36:37.967
-There’s no exit!
-Sorry!

00:36:38.050 --> 00:36:40.094
"Sorry" doesn’t cut it! Huh?

00:36:43.806 --> 00:36:45.558
You're Ichimatsu, right?

00:36:46.142 --> 00:36:49.353
He’s not a takoyaki lover
or an Esper geek.

00:36:50.104 --> 00:36:51.564
He’s our enemy.

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:53.691
A Villian.

00:36:55.234 --> 00:36:56.319
Maybe…

00:36:57.528 --> 00:36:58.571
an Esper himself.

00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:03.451
Why do the bad guys always look cooler?

00:37:03.534 --> 00:37:05.453
I was thinking that just a bit too.

00:37:06.662 --> 00:37:08.039
The Young Three.

00:37:16.756 --> 00:37:19.759
Hey, kid! Hand over that case!

00:37:21.135 --> 00:37:24.096
They said it’s a killer virus.

00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:25.931
-Killer virus?
-Killer virus?

00:37:26.015 --> 00:37:27.016
Don’t play dumb!

00:37:27.850 --> 00:37:29.935
You’re part of some secret group

00:37:30.019 --> 00:37:31.979
planning a virus attack, right?

00:37:33.481 --> 00:37:34.648
We won’t let you!

00:37:34.732 --> 00:37:36.275
We’re not in any organization.

00:37:36.359 --> 00:37:38.361
We’re trying to stop you.

00:37:38.444 --> 00:37:39.904
You’re the evil ones.

00:37:40.738 --> 00:37:41.822
We’re…

00:37:41.906 --> 00:37:43.574
The ones saving the world!

00:37:43.657 --> 00:37:44.658
Right?

00:37:44.742 --> 00:37:46.202
-Yeah!
-Then, why

00:37:46.869 --> 00:37:48.913
are you dumping the virus into the sea?

00:37:50.915 --> 00:37:51.916
Why?

00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:54.251
Why?

00:37:56.128 --> 00:37:57.254
Contaminating the ocean…

00:37:58.881 --> 00:37:59.757
Bioterrorism?

00:38:01.675 --> 00:38:04.929
Maybe it’s a virus
engineered to thrive in seawater?

00:38:05.471 --> 00:38:08.724
Using genes from Vibrio vulnificus.

00:38:08.808 --> 00:38:09.683
What’s that?

00:38:09.767 --> 00:38:12.061
It causes extreme pain,
skin swelling, and tissue necrosis.

00:38:12.144 --> 00:38:14.980
If it spreads through the blood,

00:38:15.064 --> 00:38:17.066
it kills 80% of those infected.

00:38:17.149 --> 00:38:17.942
Terrifying!

00:38:18.984 --> 00:38:19.902
What are they saying?

00:38:20.528 --> 00:38:21.654
I have no clue.

00:38:22.571 --> 00:38:23.531
-Well…
-The time limit…

00:38:24.198 --> 00:38:25.199
We’ve got three minutes.

00:38:26.158 --> 00:38:28.494
Dangerous or not,

00:38:28.577 --> 00:38:29.954
we throw it into the sea, now.

00:38:30.830 --> 00:38:31.747
Yeah!

00:38:31.831 --> 00:38:32.998
Let's do it!

00:38:33.082 --> 00:38:34.125
I already asked

00:38:35.126 --> 00:38:36.252
the sea roaches for help.

00:38:37.461 --> 00:38:39.755
Ichimatsu, hold on. This…

00:38:39.839 --> 00:38:41.799
If that's real, he'll…

00:38:41.882 --> 00:38:43.050
Just don't open it.

00:38:43.134 --> 00:38:44.510
I don't know…

00:38:46.011 --> 00:38:47.596
‎Ah! Bugs!

00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:50.391
Bugs!

00:38:52.351 --> 00:38:54.228
What's wrong? You okay?

00:38:55.354 --> 00:38:56.147
-You okay?
-Hey!

00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:57.606
-What's wrong?
-What's wrong?

00:38:58.649 --> 00:38:59.483
Hear something?

00:38:59.567 --> 00:39:00.568
Nothing.

00:39:00.651 --> 00:39:01.861
Kujo! Lower the frequency!

00:39:01.944 --> 00:39:02.820
Give it to me!

00:39:03.446 --> 00:39:05.823
Old people can’t hear the mosquito tone!

00:39:05.906 --> 00:39:06.991
Who are you calling old?

00:39:07.074 --> 00:39:08.617
You can read minds?

00:39:09.243 --> 00:39:10.119
Dehydration attack!

00:39:11.871 --> 00:39:14.165
So, it was you, you tear-jerking brat!

00:39:14.874 --> 00:39:16.542
Be grateful I spared your lower half!

00:39:22.548 --> 00:39:23.549
Got it!

00:39:24.216 --> 00:39:26.010
I got it! Fall back!

00:39:27.803 --> 00:39:29.054
Wait!

00:39:29.889 --> 00:39:30.806
Wait!

00:39:33.017 --> 00:39:34.143
Stop!

00:39:40.232 --> 00:39:41.108
Shiki!

00:39:41.192 --> 00:39:42.693
Are you okay?

00:39:43.319 --> 00:39:44.528
Hand me the case!

00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:56.123
Why are you trying to kill?

00:39:56.207 --> 00:39:57.416
Let go!

00:40:16.894 --> 00:40:17.853
Who are you?

00:40:23.692 --> 00:40:26.612
I came to reset the junction.

00:41:18.247 --> 00:41:20.332
They vanished?

00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:26.005
What’s happening?

00:41:26.088 --> 00:41:27.172
No idea…

00:41:33.762 --> 00:41:35.264
Shiki! Watch out!

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:37.433
Shiki!

00:41:44.732 --> 00:41:45.858
It’s empty.

00:41:49.153 --> 00:41:50.487
There’s nothing inside.

00:41:53.282 --> 00:41:54.533
What the hell?

00:41:56.327 --> 00:41:58.162
What the hell is this…?

00:42:03.542 --> 00:42:05.586
-Why are you trying to kill it?
-Let go!

00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:08.380
Ten million people will die
because of you!

00:42:11.050 --> 00:42:12.343
Save those…

00:42:13.761 --> 00:42:15.012
10,000 people.

00:42:22.519 --> 00:42:24.897
Ten million people will die
because of you!

00:42:25.856 --> 00:42:28.484
Save those 10,000 people.

00:42:49.672 --> 00:42:51.840
The unidentified factor verified.

00:43:03.936 --> 00:43:05.187
Shiki…

00:43:07.064 --> 00:43:08.023
Why?

00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:16.759
‎Who is your boss?

00:44:16.842 --> 00:44:18.510
‎He's being deceived.

00:44:18.594 --> 00:44:19.720
‎Don't come near again!

00:44:19.803 --> 00:44:20.846
‎You got it?

00:44:20.929 --> 00:44:22.139
‎Is ten million people going to die

00:44:22.222 --> 00:44:23.640
‎because of me?

00:44:24.433 --> 00:44:27.144
‎Have I met Kizashi before?

00:44:27.227 --> 00:44:28.061
‎THIS DRAMA IS FICTION
