00:09:38.333 --> 00:09:39.667
This punk hit first.

00:09:39.667 --> 00:09:40.900
Min Ho.

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:42.833
Look at this kid lying.

00:09:42.833 --> 00:09:44.896
Where'd you learn to lie?

00:09:44.896 --> 00:09:48.096
- Ma'am.
- Huh? Did your parents teach you to lie?

00:09:48.096 --> 00:09:49.633
Ma'am, please calm down and wait a moment.

00:09:49.633 --> 00:09:54.333
They say his parents are too busy
with their divorce to care about him.

00:09:56.133 --> 00:09:58.567
- Wait, divorce?
- Divorce?

00:09:59.267 --> 00:10:00.600
Ma'am, please don't say that...

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.533
I hit him first.

00:10:02.533 --> 00:10:03.667
What?

00:10:03.667 --> 00:10:06.000
I said I hit him first.

00:10:13.184 --> 00:10:16.667
[Mobeom Elementary School]
Making a scene over nothing. Unbelievable.

00:10:18.333 --> 00:10:21.300
Don't worry, U Dol.

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.333
I will take care of it, so you just

00:10:23.333 --> 00:10:25.800
focus on your studies.

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:29.100
Aren't you going to scold me?

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:30.500
What did you do wrong?

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.900
He probably started it first.

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.167
Let's go to the hospital first.

00:10:35.167 --> 00:10:37.233
I just want to go home.

00:10:37.233 --> 00:10:39.800
No, you're hurt. You need to go to the hospital.

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.067
I just want to go home.

00:10:41.067 --> 00:10:44.200
I want to go home. Take me home!

00:10:52.167 --> 00:10:56.000
Aren't you going to tell me why you really fought?

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.433
No matter how angry you get,
you shouldn't hit people.

00:10:58.433 --> 00:11:00.733
Violence is bad.

00:11:04.864 --> 00:11:08.767
Did you know about this too?

00:11:08.767 --> 00:11:10.200
About what?

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.400
That Mom lied?

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.200
Lied?

00:11:22.567 --> 00:11:23.633
How's U Dol?

00:11:23.633 --> 00:11:25.600
He fell asleep.

00:11:26.233 --> 00:11:28.267
He hasn't even done his homework.
How could you let him sleep?

00:11:28.267 --> 00:11:30.100
- U Dol!
- Just leave him.

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:31.700
He passed out from exhaustion.

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:34.467
He must've been under a lot of stress.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:38.467
There's no way he hit first.

00:11:38.467 --> 00:11:41.867
Min Ho definitely looks like
the type to throw the first punch.

00:11:41.867 --> 00:11:43.000
Mom.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.600
They're still kids, so don't say things

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.167
about throwing the first punch.

00:11:47.167 --> 00:11:51.033
It's a matter of home education.

00:11:51.033 --> 00:11:52.467
Jeez.

00:11:52.467 --> 00:11:56.400
Why does he sleep in your room instead of his own?

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:59.967
He has to do his homework, you know?

00:12:11.424 --> 00:12:15.167
Kids naturally grow up fighting like that.

00:12:15.167 --> 00:12:18.733
Let's not embarrass ourselves
fighting over childish things.

00:12:18.733 --> 00:12:22.967
Why would someone who's usually so level-headed

00:12:22.967 --> 00:12:24.767
say something like divorce

00:12:24.767 --> 00:12:29.400
in front of the kids?

00:12:31.104 --> 00:12:32.800
I won't

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.800
just let this slide.

00:12:50.464 --> 00:12:53.267
I can't believe it.

00:12:53.267 --> 00:12:55.900
They're the ones at fault, anyway.

00:13:06.967 --> 00:13:09.333
Oh, dear son.

00:13:09.333 --> 00:13:13.967
How could you not come home even once a week?

00:13:13.967 --> 00:13:16.533
I know your lab keeps you busy.

00:13:16.533 --> 00:13:20.400
Professor must be struggling without you.

00:13:21.333 --> 00:13:24.333
You still need to make sure
you're eating properly, okay?

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:27.667
Love you, son.

00:13:28.833 --> 00:13:30.633
Yeah.

00:13:53.536 --> 00:13:55.400
Hello.

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:56.600
Huh?

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.500
There's no meeting today?

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.233
I'm here to boost the sales.

00:14:00.233 --> 00:14:02.833
Ah, an appointment?

00:14:02.833 --> 00:14:04.233
A date.

00:14:04.233 --> 00:14:06.067
A date?

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.400
Oh, it's that person, huh?

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.567
Who?

00:14:09.567 --> 00:14:11.328
Well,

00:14:11.328 --> 00:14:12.333
it's not.

00:14:12.333 --> 00:14:13.733
Wow.

00:14:13.733 --> 00:14:16.867
So the person you're dating has changed again?

00:14:16.867 --> 00:14:19.600
The ones I've seen,

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:24.100
one, two, three, four, five, six,

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:26.000
seven, eight, nine, ten.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.233
- Eleven.
- Jonathan.

00:14:27.233 --> 00:14:29.133
Not funny.

00:14:30.133 --> 00:14:32.200
What's the reason for the breakup this time?

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.233
Well...

00:14:33.233 --> 00:14:36.300
He said something I told him never to say.

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:40.100
I asked him to just follow
that one rule. Why couldn't he?

00:14:43.733 --> 00:14:47.267
Don't tell me your date today is...

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.833
Him?

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.833
What is it?

00:15:06.133 --> 00:15:07.200
This...

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.500
I said I'd buy it for you.

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:17.233
So, did you work in construction to pay for it?

00:15:18.432 --> 00:15:20.667
Ah, this is...

00:15:20.667 --> 00:15:23.433
Thanks. I'll use it well.

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:28.333
Oh, Ms. Taeng Ja!

00:15:31.533 --> 00:15:33.728
Ms. Taeng Ja.

00:15:39.072 --> 00:15:40.367
Enjoy it.

00:15:40.367 --> 00:15:42.367
Thank you.

00:15:43.552 --> 00:15:46.233
Was the person I saw earlier an art student?

00:15:46.233 --> 00:15:48.100
He looked so fresh.

00:15:48.733 --> 00:15:50.467
Mr. Kim Seok Gu.

00:15:50.467 --> 00:15:52.233
Yes.

00:15:52.233 --> 00:15:55.600
Let's end our relationship here.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.667
What?

00:15:57.667 --> 00:15:59.200
Why so sudden?

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:03.900
I told you not to call my name.

00:16:06.144 --> 00:16:07.833
I guess this is where our relationship ends.

00:16:07.833 --> 00:16:09.767
Then, goodbye.

00:16:09.767 --> 00:16:11.533
Wait...

00:16:11.533 --> 00:16:13.333
Ms. Taeng Ja.

00:16:33.696 --> 00:16:36.200
Don't pick at your food.
You're gonna waste your luck.

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.033
Ah, okay.

00:16:44.032 --> 00:16:46.300
Is it not tasty?

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:49.333
- It's not that.
- Then why are you picking at it like that?

00:16:49.333 --> 00:16:51.733
You're ruining my appetite too.

00:16:52.767 --> 00:16:54.633
I'm sorry.

00:16:56.896 --> 00:16:59.733
This is what it's like between us.

00:16:59.733 --> 00:17:01.033
Generation gap.

00:17:01.033 --> 00:17:03.767
What's the big deal about that?
Is it really important?

00:17:03.767 --> 00:17:05.833
Do you like me?

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:09.300
I don't see you as a man.

00:17:10.333 --> 00:17:11.400
Date someone your own age.

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.333
Stop being needlessly stubborn.

00:17:13.333 --> 00:17:15.933
It looks better that way.

00:17:15.933 --> 00:17:17.300
I'll get going now.

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:19.833
I can't keep looking at that expression of yours.

00:17:19.833 --> 00:17:21.767
See you at the meeting.

00:17:47.328 --> 00:17:48.567
Sorry.

00:17:48.567 --> 00:17:50.767
Eun Gi has been ordering a lot today.

00:17:50.767 --> 00:17:53.600
So? You threw another tantrum and just left?

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:54.720
No,

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:55.867
you told me not to do that.

00:17:55.867 --> 00:17:57.633
Yeah, don't do that.

00:17:57.633 --> 00:17:58.967
You don't need to walk me home every day.

00:17:58.967 --> 00:18:00.400
No.

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.400
You're more important than work to me.

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:05.344
- More than work?
- Yeah.

00:18:05.344 --> 00:18:07.800
You're the most important.

00:18:09.633 --> 00:18:10.633
Where are your friends?

00:18:10.633 --> 00:18:12.233
You're running late, so they went ahead.

00:18:12.233 --> 00:18:14.033
Let's go.

00:18:20.864 --> 00:18:22.867
Let's hold hands and go.

00:18:30.048 --> 00:18:33.000
I used to wonder why people get married.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.633
It's for this reason.

00:18:34.633 --> 00:18:36.733
To not want to break up.

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.467
- Gi Jeong.
- Huh?

00:18:42.467 --> 00:18:46.200
You said earlier that
I'm more important than work.

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.667
Of course.

00:18:47.667 --> 00:18:49.967
Honestly, right now,

00:18:49.967 --> 00:18:53.033
I can't say the same to you.

00:18:53.033 --> 00:18:55.167
Oh, really?

00:18:55.167 --> 00:18:59.633
I'm not saying you're less
important than studying,

00:18:59.633 --> 00:19:01.952
but right now,

00:19:01.952 --> 00:19:04.200
studying is really important for me.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:07.067
My future depends on it.

00:19:07.067 --> 00:19:09.567
It doesn't have to be studying,

00:19:09.567 --> 00:19:12.667
but haven't you ever imagined
your future with what you're doing now?

00:19:12.667 --> 00:19:16.367
Like becoming a famous model,

00:19:16.367 --> 00:19:19.433
or working in related fields.

00:19:19.433 --> 00:19:21.184
No,

00:19:21.184 --> 00:19:23.232
I haven't.

00:19:23.232 --> 00:19:25.067
I'm just doing part-time jobs.

00:19:25.067 --> 00:19:26.700
I told you.

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:28.800
You don't have to stress over it.

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:32.933
I just feel like I'll end up
being a really cool person, you know?

00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:45.433
- Wait...
- Stay still.

00:19:45.433 --> 00:19:46.967
I'm sharing my energy with you.

00:19:46.967 --> 00:19:50.033
Energy to become amazing.

00:19:50.033 --> 00:19:54.233
You overthink way too much.

00:19:54.233 --> 00:19:57.767
I've thought a lot because of you too,

00:19:57.767 --> 00:19:59.967
and it's really hard.

00:19:59.967 --> 00:20:01.367
I've tried studying too,

00:20:01.367 --> 00:20:04.900
but honestly, it's not something humans should do.

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:08.600
So,

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:13.667
just leave it.

00:20:13.667 --> 00:20:16.867
You'll become someone incredible anyway.

00:20:18.033 --> 00:20:19.633
You really think so?

00:20:19.633 --> 00:20:21.600
Of course.

00:20:39.616 --> 00:20:41.567
U Yeon?

00:20:49.248 --> 00:20:51.200
U Dol.

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.633
Ow, it hurts.

00:20:52.633 --> 00:20:54.000
Who is he?

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.067
Huh?

00:20:56.067 --> 00:20:57.567
Who are you?

00:20:57.567 --> 00:21:00.733
U Dol, this is my friend.

00:21:00.733 --> 00:21:02.200
This is my little brother.

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:04.000
Huh?

00:21:04.867 --> 00:21:06.300
Brother-in-law.

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:07.567
Quickly take him away,

00:21:07.567 --> 00:21:08.633
or something bad might happen.

00:21:08.633 --> 00:21:10.200
Oh? Brother-in-law,

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:11.800
I'm not a thing.

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:14.100
Get him out of here before Mom comes.

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:16.600
- What?
- U Dol.

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:17.600
- Go on, just go.
- U Dol.

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:19.000
Why'd he leave so fast?

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.233
- Mom.
- U Dol.

00:21:21.233 --> 00:21:23.600

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:25.633
Song U Dol?

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:28.533
Huh?

00:21:29.667 --> 00:21:31.500
Why are you here?

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:34.067
- Mom.
- You just got home?

00:21:34.067 --> 00:21:35.900
Huh?

00:21:38.688 --> 00:21:40.064
Yeah,

00:21:40.064 --> 00:21:42.000
she just got home.

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:45.233
U Dol.

00:21:45.984 --> 00:21:49.167
Ugh, that kid's still sulking.

00:21:49.167 --> 00:21:50.900
Look at this.

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:54.300
He's doing exactly what you did to me last week.

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:57.800
Your actions get reflected like this.

00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:59.633
Get inside quickly.

00:21:59.633 --> 00:22:01.152
U Dol,

00:22:01.152 --> 00:22:03.500
wait for me.

00:22:17.967 --> 00:22:21.467
[Gi Jeong: Your mom didn't notice me, did she?
I'm pretty quick, huh?]

00:22:21.467 --> 00:22:23.367
[Yeah, we're fine.]

00:22:23.367 --> 00:22:27.500
[Don't worry about your brother.]

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:30.633
[He saw us hugging.]

00:22:30.633 --> 00:22:34.667
[Pfft, what does that kid know?
Just say it's a friendly hug.]

00:22:34.667 --> 00:22:38.767
He's not just some kid.

00:23:00.864 --> 00:23:02.167
Hey, U Dol.

00:23:02.167 --> 00:23:03.800
Did you get a boyfriend?

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.600
Huh?

00:23:06.912 --> 00:23:08.433
Yeah.

00:23:08.433 --> 00:23:10.667
I don't like him.

00:23:10.667 --> 00:23:11.767
Break up with him.

00:23:11.767 --> 00:23:12.967
No, U Dol.

00:23:12.967 --> 00:23:14.667
If Mom finds out, she'll go crazy.

00:23:14.667 --> 00:23:17.767
I don't want to keep seeing you
get scolded by Mom.

00:23:17.767 --> 00:23:20.633
- Huh?
- So break up quickly.

00:23:20.633 --> 00:23:21.867
What?

00:23:21.867 --> 00:23:24.416
Don't come to my house for a while.

00:23:24.416 --> 00:23:25.600
Don't contact me either.

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:26.867
Don't wait for me at school.

00:23:26.867 --> 00:23:27.900
Don't even come to the study room.

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:29.500
Why not?

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:31.433
Just do as I say for now.

00:23:31.433 --> 00:23:32.967
If he tells Mom, it's over.

00:23:32.967 --> 00:23:36.700
Why is that little kid
trying to act like an older brother?

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:40.233
He's not just an ordinary kid.

00:23:40.233 --> 00:23:43.800
He's still just 10 years old, right?

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:46.667
But I'm telling you,
he's not a normal 10-year-old.

00:23:48.512 --> 00:23:51.667
Anyway, just follow my plan for now.

00:23:51.667 --> 00:23:53.967
- U Yeon.
- I'll contact you again.

00:23:53.967 --> 00:23:55.387
U Yeon,

00:23:55.387 --> 00:23:56.633
U Yeon!

00:23:56.633 --> 00:23:59.167
What's wrong? Did you guys fight?

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.700
Darn. If he's not just an ordinary kid...

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:09.300
Okay.

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:10.560
Hey,

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:12.233
what were you doing in third grade?

00:24:12.233 --> 00:24:14.400
- I picked my nose.
- No, not that stuff.

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:15.833
- I played games!
- Yeah, isn't that

00:24:15.833 --> 00:24:17.800
what you're supposed to do in third grade?

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.400
Right! They're usually
picking their nose and playing games!

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:23.767
But seriously, why is he like that?

00:24:23.767 --> 00:24:26.433
Hey!

00:24:28.576 --> 00:24:30.000
Darn it.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.967
Ah, that crazy punk. Is this thing broken?

00:24:32.967 --> 00:24:34.432
I'll smash it to pieces.

[Mobeom Elementary School]

Hey, kiddo.

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:40.433
Can we talk for a sec?

00:24:40.433 --> 00:24:42.667
Wow, a giant.

00:24:42.667 --> 00:24:46.000
I have something to say.

Hey, kiddo.

Hey, can't you hear me?

00:24:49.633 --> 00:24:50.800
I said I need to talk.

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:52.933
Wow, a handsome giant.

00:24:52.933 --> 00:24:53.967
Come here quickly.

Oh, look at that tiny kid.

Hey, the kiddo's friend.

Yes?

Don't answer.

Okay, got it.

00:25:02.133 --> 00:25:03.367
Want me to buy you ice cream?

00:25:03.367 --> 00:25:05.233
Yes.

00:25:09.167 --> 00:25:10.272
Poison?

I don't care about that.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.100
Which school do you go to?

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.067
Chiwon High.

00:25:40.067 --> 00:25:42.933
The one on top of the mountain?

00:25:42.933 --> 00:25:45.567
Oh, you know it.

00:25:45.567 --> 00:25:49.467
Well, our school is pretty famous.

- Wait.
- Where are you going suddenly?

Thanks for the ice cream.

What was that?

00:26:08.067 --> 00:26:10.600
That's total disrespect.

Darn it.

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:13.567
Isn't this too much? From an elementary kid?

00:26:13.567 --> 00:26:14.933
Yes, exactly.

00:26:14.933 --> 00:26:17.067
Is it our fault for attending Chiwon High?

00:26:17.067 --> 00:26:18.867
Darn it.

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:22.367
Then whose fault is it?

00:26:26.912 --> 00:26:28.167
Stop overreacting.

00:26:28.167 --> 00:26:30.033
He's still just a kid.

00:26:30.033 --> 00:26:31.467
No.

00:26:31.467 --> 00:26:33.733
U Yeon was right.

00:26:33.733 --> 00:26:34.976
He is

00:26:34.976 --> 00:26:36.667
not just an ordinary kid.

00:26:36.667 --> 00:26:40.000
Even if he's smart, he's just a 3rd grader.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.200
You might look like someone who just

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:45.100
relies on being handsome and acts like a punk,

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:47.467
but show him you're actually a kind person.

00:26:47.467 --> 00:26:48.633
Did you just insult me?

00:26:48.633 --> 00:26:49.667
That was a compliment.

00:26:49.667 --> 00:26:50.933
Sounded like an insult.

00:26:50.933 --> 00:26:53.033
Does that matter right now?

00:26:53.033 --> 00:26:54.688
Any ideas?

00:26:55.392 --> 00:26:57.967
Huh? Brother-in-law.

00:26:57.967 --> 00:26:59.500
Brother-in-law.

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:01.700
Wow, a giant teddy bear.

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:04.300
Brother-in-law.

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:05.700
Brother-in-law.

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:06.767
Wait a minute.

Hey, where are you touching?

00:27:07.967 --> 00:27:09.167
Hey, hey!

00:27:09.167 --> 00:27:11.333
No, stop touching me.

00:27:16.133 --> 00:27:17.133
You punks!

00:27:17.133 --> 00:27:19.567
Who gave me a wedgie?

00:27:19.567 --> 00:27:21.367
You punk!

00:27:22.688 --> 00:27:25.133
Brother-in-law, brother-in-law!

00:27:25.133 --> 00:27:29.000
- He's super fun, right?
- Hey, kid!

00:27:31.633 --> 00:27:33.500
What? Kids like teddy bears?

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:35.467
Jeez, this isn't working at all.

00:27:35.467 --> 00:27:37.933
What now? Huh? Seriously.

00:27:37.933 --> 00:27:40.867
I misjudged him.

00:27:40.867 --> 00:27:43.767
Listening to classical music,
he's not just an ordinary kid.

00:27:43.767 --> 00:27:45.200
So you just realized that now?

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:47.000
Wait.

00:27:48.367 --> 00:27:50.133
Let's raise the bar.

00:27:50.133 --> 00:27:51.933
What?

00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:55.168
Something U Dol likes?

00:27:56.267 --> 00:27:57.800
Well...

00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:00.133
He likes quizzes maybe?

00:28:00.133 --> 00:28:02.233
- Why?
- Oh.

00:28:02.233 --> 00:28:03.767
Dae O asked me.

00:28:03.767 --> 00:28:06.300
Why would Dae O...

00:28:07.533 --> 00:28:10.100
Gi Jeong put him up to this, right?

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.867
- Just leave him be.
- No, they shouldn't meet.

00:28:13.867 --> 00:28:15.567
You never know what Gi Jeong might say.

00:28:15.567 --> 00:28:17.967
It seems like he's trying to do something.
Just trust me for now.

00:28:17.967 --> 00:28:21.733
We can't keep walking on eggshells
around U Dol forever.

00:28:30.368 --> 00:28:31.833
Why are you here again?

00:28:31.833 --> 00:28:34.500
Let's settle this man-to-man.

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:36.600
How childish.

00:28:37.408 --> 00:28:39.500
Scared?

00:28:40.233 --> 00:28:41.967
Who?

00:28:41.967 --> 00:28:43.767
Me?

00:28:44.533 --> 00:28:45.867
That's right.

00:28:45.867 --> 00:28:46.900
Deal.

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:48.033
That's how you should be.

00:28:48.033 --> 00:28:51.033
But if you lose, you'll break up
with my sister, right?

00:28:51.867 --> 00:28:53.733
Deal.

00:28:57.767 --> 00:29:01.033
Cuckoo, cuckoo.

00:29:01.033 --> 00:29:04.133
Cuckoo, cuckoo.

00:29:04.133 --> 00:29:05.733
Over here.

00:29:05.733 --> 00:29:07.867
- Cuckoo.
- Hey.

00:29:09.533 --> 00:29:10.833
Cuckoo.

00:29:10.833 --> 00:29:13.300
What? You're competing against U Dol?

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:15.800
Yeah, capital city quiz.

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:18.700
Must you challenge a kid to that?

00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:20.000
I know.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.067
It's ridiculous to do this with a child.

00:29:22.067 --> 00:29:23.264
But for you,

00:29:23.264 --> 00:29:26.000
I'll gladly make a fool of myself.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.567
I'll even act like a grade-schooler.

00:29:27.567 --> 00:29:31.167
But you promised to break up with me if you lose.

00:29:31.167 --> 00:29:33.200
Then I just have to win.

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:35.567
Not trying to scare you, but...

00:29:35.567 --> 00:29:40.267
U Dol memorized all 195 national capitals
when he was three.

00:29:42.976 --> 00:29:46.500
Oh, so... he only knew 195?

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:49.767
That's the exact number of
UN-recognized countries.

00:29:52.167 --> 00:29:53.633
Don't worry.

00:29:53.633 --> 00:29:56.167
I've got a Plan B.

00:29:56.167 --> 00:29:57.696
Plan B?

00:29:57.696 --> 00:29:58.900
What's that?

00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:00.733
Well...

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:04.033
We can just meet secretly.

00:30:04.033 --> 00:30:05.867
What?

00:30:09.408 --> 00:30:11.167
Right.

00:30:11.167 --> 00:30:13.600
Nothing to worry about then.

00:30:15.072 --> 00:30:17.167
I'm sorry.

00:30:17.167 --> 00:30:19.533
Making you go through this nonsense.

00:30:19.533 --> 00:30:21.733
Isn't that only right?

00:30:21.733 --> 00:30:23.633
You're special to me.

00:30:23.633 --> 00:30:26.000
Special?

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:06.467
Just see U Dol's behavior as cute.

00:40:06.467 --> 00:40:09.500
You challenged a kid to a duel
just to humor him, right?

00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:12.467
Well... yeah.

00:40:12.467 --> 00:40:14.533
Wait, how'd you know?

00:40:14.533 --> 00:40:16.133
Why wouldn't I?

00:40:16.133 --> 00:40:17.167
I'm Song U Yeon.

00:40:17.167 --> 00:40:21.400
Oh, Song U Yeon.

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:24.533
U Dol's acting like that because of me.

00:40:24.533 --> 00:40:27.300
He hates seeing me get scolded by Mom.

00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:30.767
If Mom finds out about you and me,
she'll scold me again.

00:40:30.767 --> 00:40:33.167
But when I heard that, it kind of touched me,

00:40:33.167 --> 00:40:36.533
so even though U Dol is overacting, I'm not mad.

00:40:36.533 --> 00:40:39.700
So just understand him a little.

00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:41.500
Alright.

00:40:45.333 --> 00:40:48.767
You are not right for my sister.

00:40:48.767 --> 00:40:51.867
My sister already gets ignored by Mom.

00:40:51.867 --> 00:40:55.833
If she dates someone like you, it'll get worse.

00:40:55.833 --> 00:40:58.467
Someone like me...

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:02.500
Someone like me...

00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:06.267
Ugh.

00:41:06.267 --> 00:41:08.167
He's getting ignored
by an elementary school kid, too.

00:41:08.167 --> 00:41:10.000
This is so frustrating.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.800
He spent the whole night as
that darn pink caterpillar, groaning.

00:41:14.433 --> 00:41:18.033
Looks like U Yeon's brother
really cares about her.

00:41:18.033 --> 00:41:21.800
Well, I also think U Yeon is
a hundred times better anyway.

00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:25.133
Why are you laughing?

00:41:25.133 --> 00:41:28.200
It reminded me of the first time I saw Gi Jeong.

00:41:33.367 --> 00:41:37.767
Oh, you're Geu Rin's brother.

00:41:37.767 --> 00:41:39.767
Hi.

00:41:39.767 --> 00:41:41.967
You're really tall.

00:41:44.167 --> 00:41:46.800
If you get clingy with my sister,

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:48.700
you'll regret it.

00:41:51.167 --> 00:41:52.167
What?

00:41:52.167 --> 00:41:54.400
So when did you two get close?

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:57.467
Since you started dating that punk.

00:41:58.367 --> 00:42:01.900
He came to me asking to talk you down.

00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:06.467
That's probably the first time
he called me 'brother'.

00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:10.900
Not bad for a little brother.

00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:12.733
Treat him well.

00:42:15.367 --> 00:42:16.933
I'm going to class.

00:42:16.933 --> 00:42:18.400
Have some snacks while working.

00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:20.233
Okay.

00:42:25.984 --> 00:42:27.967
Koo Seon Ho.

00:42:29.467 --> 00:42:31.733
I've completely forgotten about that guy.

00:42:31.733 --> 00:42:33.800
I'm not thinking about him at all.

00:42:38.033 --> 00:42:41.167
Does that mean he trusts me, or that he doesn't?

00:42:45.133 --> 00:42:47.600
I didn't even ask.

00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:49.700
You're so obvious.

00:42:55.667 --> 00:42:57.167
What should this week's concept be?

00:42:57.167 --> 00:42:58.867
I have something specific in mind.

00:42:58.867 --> 00:43:00.467
Oh! That thing we talked about last time?

00:43:00.467 --> 00:43:01.600
I'm in!

00:43:35.667 --> 00:43:36.900
Where are you going?

00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:38.700
Huh?

00:43:39.567 --> 00:43:41.000
Just to the study room...

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:42.167
You're lying.

00:43:42.167 --> 00:43:43.633
You're going to meet that guy, right?

00:43:43.633 --> 00:43:47.000
No, I'm heading to the croquis meeting.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.233
Then I'm coming too.

00:43:48.233 --> 00:43:50.067
What?

00:43:53.568 --> 00:43:57.733
I know you planned to meet secretly.

00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:00.200
Seriously?

00:44:01.733 --> 00:44:03.833
I'm really sorry.

00:44:03.833 --> 00:44:06.067
It's okay, just come and tell him
to stand as the model.

00:44:06.067 --> 00:44:08.067
He must be cute.

00:44:08.067 --> 00:44:09.767
We welcome anyone shorter than me.

00:44:09.767 --> 00:44:11.733
Tell him to come now!

00:44:17.088 --> 00:44:18.567
Nam Gi Jeong.

00:44:18.567 --> 00:44:21.600
Aren't you going to that SF thing today?

00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:23.800
Can't go. My girlfriend's brother is visiting.

00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:26.100
Hey, that's exactly why you should go.

00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:27.400
It's a chance to score points.

00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:29.133
Hey!

00:44:29.133 --> 00:44:32.767
♫ This unfamiliar feeling I can't place ♫

00:44:32.767 --> 00:44:36.800
♫ The more I overthink, the more confused I get ♫

00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:40.768
[Spirit Fingers, 11th Meeting]

00:44:49.152 --> 00:44:51.367
What's wrong? Let's go.

00:44:51.367 --> 00:44:53.267
- It's underground?
- Huh?

00:44:53.267 --> 00:44:56.233
Mom told me to avoid places
like basements if possible.

00:44:56.233 --> 00:44:58.033
It's dangerous in case of a fire.

00:44:58.033 --> 00:45:01.633
Mom said not to go into dark and creepy places.

00:45:01.633 --> 00:45:03.867
Oh, yes, yes, young master.

00:45:03.867 --> 00:45:06.167
Let's just head inside first.

00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:10.200
Let's go.

00:45:14.233 --> 00:45:16.967
See, it's not gloomy, right?

00:45:19.033 --> 00:45:22.400
Bigfoot, you doing okay?

00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:24.367
This is Bigfoot. Say hello.

00:45:24.367 --> 00:45:27.233
Bigfoot, this is my brother, U Dol.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.233
U Dol.

00:45:31.233 --> 00:45:33.967
Bigfoot's super smart.

00:45:33.967 --> 00:45:35.933
How smart?

00:45:35.933 --> 00:45:38.667
Well.

00:45:38.667 --> 00:45:40.367
He distinguishes room colors.

00:45:40.367 --> 00:45:42.633
Dogs are red-green colorblind.

00:45:42.633 --> 00:45:44.600
Can't tell red from green.

00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:47.000
But our Bigfoot knows them all.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.833
Come here.

00:45:51.333 --> 00:45:52.933
Look at those rooms.

00:45:52.933 --> 00:45:55.233
Each one has a different color.

00:45:55.233 --> 00:45:57.433
How does it make you feel?

00:45:58.233 --> 00:46:02.633
It was the first time I've found
my color since I came here.

00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:06.767
Today's Baby Blue.

00:46:06.767 --> 00:46:09.000
It's my personal room.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.833
Open it yourself.

00:46:20.733 --> 00:46:22.633
Wow.

00:46:26.633 --> 00:46:28.633
It's the ocean.

00:46:30.567 --> 00:46:32.567
It's the ocean!

00:46:34.867 --> 00:46:37.167
It's the ocean!

00:46:37.167 --> 00:46:39.733
Huh? U Dol.

00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:43.233
Huh?

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:47.167
Welcome, kiddo.

00:46:57.833 --> 00:46:59.967
Not sure if this fits.

00:46:59.967 --> 00:47:02.000
Thank you, Black.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.600
See, if you come suddenly like this,
it's such an inconvenience.

00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:06.800
Why would you need clothes for drawing?

00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:09.200
This is not a proper meeting.
You guys are just hanging out.

00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:11.733
No, we're not just...

00:47:11.733 --> 00:47:14.033
We totally are.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.233
Did you say your name is U Dol?

00:47:20.544 --> 00:47:23.133
What do you think is a proper meeting?

00:47:23.133 --> 00:47:25.467
Investing time in meaningful pursuits.

00:47:25.467 --> 00:47:26.700
I see.

00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:28.100
What counts as 'meaningful'?

00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:31.033
Things that advance society.

00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:37.267
Who decides that?

00:47:37.267 --> 00:47:39.433
It's obvious, right?

00:47:39.433 --> 00:47:41.067
Nothing's inherently obvious.

00:47:41.067 --> 00:47:42.633
Listen carefully, kiddo.

00:47:42.633 --> 00:47:45.300
Value is something you define yourself.

00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:47.567
Not what some book says.

00:47:47.567 --> 00:47:50.633
Living hard for a week, then for one day

00:47:50.633 --> 00:47:54.067
becoming someone special and drawing what we like,

00:47:54.067 --> 00:47:56.733
that's our version of being meaningful.

00:47:56.733 --> 00:47:59.600
This seems like a pretty proper meeting to me.

00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:01.400
I can't accept that.

00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:05.333
The truth is, studying is
more important than playing.

00:48:05.333 --> 00:48:09.867
Fine. Whether you agree or not is your choice.

00:48:09.867 --> 00:48:14.933
But we're free to reject rude party crashers too.

00:48:17.867 --> 00:48:20.900
Either wear this or go home.

00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:23.067
Your call.

00:48:35.067 --> 00:48:39.067
How am I supposed to wear this?

00:48:39.067 --> 00:48:40.900
Need help?

00:48:41.967 --> 00:48:43.767
Hello?

00:48:43.767 --> 00:48:45.800
I'm Koo Seon Ho.

00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:48.500
That was too harsh on the kid earlier.

00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:53.033
I just treated him like an adult
because he didn't want to be treated like a child.

00:48:53.033 --> 00:48:55.733
I'm sorry, my brother has been acting really rude.

00:48:55.733 --> 00:48:57.667
No, it's okay.

00:48:57.667 --> 00:49:00.533
Actually, I was exactly like that
when I was young.

00:49:01.633 --> 00:49:05.100
But why are you so helpless
around your little brother?

00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:08.133
Yeah, when he acts up,
just smack him and set him straight.

00:49:08.133 --> 00:49:10.833
Like this, like this, like this, like this!

00:49:10.833 --> 00:49:12.433
Poor Gi Jeong.

00:49:12.433 --> 00:49:14.000
That's how real siblings act.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.267
That's right, good job.

00:49:21.233 --> 00:49:24.500
- Wow.
- Wow.

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:29.100
Well, this photo feels a bit ambiguous.

00:49:31.264 --> 00:49:33.233
I wish we could redo this one.

00:49:34.688 --> 00:49:36.433
Will he reshoot?

00:49:36.433 --> 00:49:37.767
Right?

00:49:37.767 --> 00:49:39.433
No, it's just...

00:49:39.433 --> 00:49:42.667
My sister already gets ignored by Mom.

00:49:42.667 --> 00:49:46.167
If she dates someone like you, it'll get worse.

00:49:46.967 --> 00:49:48.367
I think it would be better
if he could strike a stronger pose.

00:49:48.367 --> 00:49:50.667
It's okay, but...

00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:54.200
Let's reshoot.

00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:55.633
- Huh?
- Huh?

00:49:55.633 --> 00:49:58.100
Give me the clothes. We're redoing it.

00:49:59.067 --> 00:50:00.933
Bro.

00:50:00.933 --> 00:50:04.833
If anything feels off next time,
tell me to reshoot. Okay?

00:50:04.833 --> 00:50:05.867
Okay.

00:50:05.867 --> 00:50:07.900
That's how professionals do it.

00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:15.967
Now only Gi Jeong's not here?

00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:18.167
Oh, right.

00:50:18.167 --> 00:50:20.800
Gi Jeong isn't coming anymore, right?

00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:22.333
He quit, didn't he?

00:50:22.333 --> 00:50:23.567
Yes.

00:50:23.567 --> 00:50:25.467
When?

00:50:25.467 --> 00:50:27.667
Khaki!

00:50:27.667 --> 00:50:30.667
You pose first. Go ahead.

00:50:30.667 --> 00:50:34.267
Alright, starting 3-minute croquis now.

00:50:40.667 --> 00:50:43.667
Want me to teach you how to do croquis?

00:50:43.667 --> 00:50:45.467
No, thanks.

00:51:13.733 --> 00:51:15.300
Vanilla!

00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:17.200
Niagara!

00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:19.300
- Abu... what was it?
- Yeah, that one.

00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:21.600
Pass, pass! I don't know!

00:51:24.667 --> 00:51:27.300
I'd accept it if it were that guy.

00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:30.067
- Hey, are you okay?
- Are you okay?

00:51:30.067 --> 00:51:32.067
- Ouch, it hurts.
- Be careful.

00:51:32.067 --> 00:51:33.333
Let me see.

00:51:33.333 --> 00:51:36.867
What's this weirdly uncomfortable
feeling I'm getting?

00:51:36.867 --> 00:51:38.600
Whose sketchbook is this?
There's nothing drawn here.

00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:40.167
That's yours, right?

00:51:40.167 --> 00:51:42.700
It's better to not draw at all than to draw badly.

00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:44.100
It's a waste of time.

00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:45.600
U Dol, but still...

00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:47.500
What if I can't draw well?

00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:51.100
It's natural to struggle with your first croquis.

00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:05.500
How about trying to draw like this?

00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:07.168
If you

00:52:07.168 --> 00:52:09.900
were to draw her...

00:52:09.900 --> 00:52:11.967
- Like this.
- Me?

00:52:11.967 --> 00:52:14.000
Is this a drawing?

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.700
Have you heard of abstract art?

00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:18.067
Of course!

00:52:18.067 --> 00:52:21.433
Abstract art moves away from mimicking shapes

00:52:21.433 --> 00:52:25.967
to focus on pure elements
like points, lines, surfaces, and colors.

00:52:25.967 --> 00:52:27.367
Right.

00:52:27.367 --> 00:52:30.400
If you see this as abstract art,
it becomes a valid piece.

00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:33.833
If figure drawing's hard,
try approaching it like abstraction.

00:52:33.833 --> 00:52:37.133
Or like me, just draw the parts you like.

00:52:37.133 --> 00:52:39.567
SF doesn't have any set rules.

00:52:39.567 --> 00:52:42.400
You're free to draw however you want.

00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:44.400
There's no such thing as a bad drawing.

00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:46.667
- There isn't.
- There isn't.

00:52:46.667 --> 00:52:49.000
You can do it. You can do it.

00:52:50.867 --> 00:52:53.033
What do you think?

00:52:53.033 --> 00:52:55.233
Wanna give it a try?

00:52:56.033 --> 00:52:58.167
This meeting really feels weird.

00:52:58.167 --> 00:53:00.400
U Dol.

00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:02.633
But I'll try it for once.

00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:28.533
♫ You're shining brightly, like a star ♫

00:53:28.533 --> 00:53:32.067
♫ You're lighting up my heart ♫

00:53:32.067 --> 00:53:37.400
♫ With your own light, your own color ♫

00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:40.200
♫ You make the whole world beautiful ♫

00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:42.667
Next up, our little guest.

00:53:42.667 --> 00:53:46.567
♫ You, who fill my dreams ♫

00:53:46.567 --> 00:53:50.167
♫ I really want to reach you ♫

00:53:50.167 --> 00:53:56.433
♫ Become a comet of miracles ♫

00:53:57.567 --> 00:53:58.833
Uzbekistan.

00:53:58.833 --> 00:54:00.067
Tashkent.

00:54:00.067 --> 00:54:02.167
- Romania.
- Bucharest.

00:54:02.167 --> 00:54:03.167
What's the capital of Kenya?

00:54:03.167 --> 00:54:04.867
- Nairobi.
- What about the UAE?

00:54:04.867 --> 00:54:06.467
Abu Dhabi.

00:54:06.467 --> 00:54:08.500
São Tomé and Príncipe.

00:54:09.433 --> 00:54:11.233
São Tomé.

00:54:13.733 --> 00:54:15.600
Do you have a girlfriend?

00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:17.200
Huh?

00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:18.933
U Dol.

00:54:18.933 --> 00:54:21.400
If you're single, how about dating my sister?

00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:22.500
What are you doing?

00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:24.567
She's naturally pretty once you look closely.

00:54:24.567 --> 00:54:26.767
- And she's kind!
- U Dol, U Dol.

00:54:26.767 --> 00:54:27.933
I'm sorry, Seon Ho.

00:54:27.933 --> 00:54:30.367
I'm sorry, but I...

00:54:30.367 --> 00:54:32.933
He likes someone else.

00:54:37.167 --> 00:54:39.400
She's a hundred times less pretty than U Yeon

00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:42.433
and a thousand times worse in personality,

00:54:42.433 --> 00:54:44.700
but, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

00:54:47.233 --> 00:54:49.733
You said he wouldn't come, right?

00:54:49.733 --> 00:54:53.033
You lost the game, right?
You said you wouldn't meet my sister.

00:54:53.033 --> 00:54:54.900
U Dol.

00:55:04.967 --> 00:55:06.100
No, stop looking.

00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:07.233
Do you think I'm stupid?

00:55:07.233 --> 00:55:08.667
I saw you holding hands earlier.

00:55:08.667 --> 00:55:10.967
Let's talk about adult relationships,
adult relationships.

00:55:10.967 --> 00:55:13.800
Is it normal to not care
when my girlfriend's ex keeps hovering?

00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:16.400
How should I make you feel like I'm a man to you?

00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:17.400
Liking someone?

00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:20.467
Maybe you just want to get to know
each other more and more?

00:55:20.467 --> 00:55:22.733
I did what Mom said, even if I didn't like it,
because I was afraid you'd hate me.

00:55:22.733 --> 00:55:23.900
I hate it when Mom plays favorites.

00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:26.100
- I'll throw it away.
- You've started

00:55:26.100 --> 00:55:28.000
avoiding me again, huh?

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:31.000
Like a real man, smack the wall!

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:32.900
What should I do, Gi Jeong?

00:55:32.900 --> 00:55:36.033
I'm trying to hate you.

00:55:42.533 --> 00:55:45.100
I have a request.

00:55:46.967 --> 00:55:49.933
From now on, don't call me a kid or anything.

00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:54.533
I don't want to.

00:55:54.533 --> 00:55:56.067
Why not?

00:55:56.067 --> 00:55:58.033
It's just how I feel.

00:56:06.267 --> 00:56:08.067
Did you get scolded?
