00:00:09.322 --> 00:00:11.282
As for Asuka Kunimi…

00:00:13.368 --> 00:00:16.162
we will continue her kishi admission test.

00:00:17.122 --> 00:00:22.126
However, I will be personally serving…

00:00:24.879 --> 00:00:27.423
as the examiner for the final match.

00:00:57.412 --> 00:00:59.414
Shoichi Yuuki's memoir.

00:01:00.123 --> 00:01:03.918
These are the pages I removed
from the manuscript.

00:01:08.381 --> 00:01:09.424
SHOICHI YUUKI

00:01:15.638 --> 00:01:16.848
This part was

00:01:18.308 --> 00:01:20.310
dedicated to you and your mother.

00:01:22.103 --> 00:01:23.062
What?

00:01:25.398 --> 00:01:27.483
I will give my all…

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.529
to defeat Asuka Kunimi.

00:02:05.772 --> 00:02:09.192
We should end this. All of it.

00:03:19.262 --> 00:03:21.681
KEIKO AND ASUKA.

00:03:22.181 --> 00:03:27.937
I LEFT THE TWO OF THEM,
MY MOST BELOVED FAMILY.

00:03:34.652 --> 00:03:36.487
I went to meet Asuka Kunimi.

00:03:40.908 --> 00:03:45.997
I gave her the part of your memoir
about the Kunimi family.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.710
For what?

00:03:54.547 --> 00:03:56.424
For the Yuuki family.

00:04:01.179 --> 00:04:02.472
I see.

00:04:10.396 --> 00:04:12.023
That day…

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:16.903
my life as a kishi ended once.

00:04:20.323 --> 00:04:25.870
It was the time when I went over a year
without a single win.

00:04:26.704 --> 00:04:29.082
I was on the verge of retiring.

00:04:36.005 --> 00:04:37.173
I resign.

00:04:37.673 --> 00:04:38.800
Thank you.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.386
Day by day, my confidence crumbled.

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:44.055
I was afraid of the young talents.

00:04:45.098 --> 00:04:46.474
As a kishi,

00:04:47.183 --> 00:04:49.644
my career was about to hit rock bottom.

00:04:51.187 --> 00:04:53.398
What was I missing?

00:04:55.608 --> 00:04:56.734
I couldn't figure it out.

00:04:59.112 --> 00:05:00.154
I was alone…

00:05:01.614 --> 00:05:03.408
falling deeper and deeper.

00:05:04.992 --> 00:05:09.163
Still, I could go home
to my beloved family.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.458
My wife and daughter

00:05:12.542 --> 00:05:16.087
eased the loneliness
I was constantly feeling.

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:22.927
Even though their presence made me happy,

00:05:24.303 --> 00:05:28.808
a darker thought crept in
and occupied my mind.

00:05:30.726 --> 00:05:35.982
"If they were not here,
I'd be able to focus on shogi."

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.654
"Could it be that
I keep losing because of them?"

00:05:49.704 --> 00:05:51.038
And then,

00:05:52.206 --> 00:05:53.457
that day came.

00:05:57.879 --> 00:06:00.464
Oh Dad! Look!

00:06:02.717 --> 00:06:06.387
I'm good now. I want to play with you.

00:06:12.685 --> 00:06:13.853
ASUKA KUNIMI
WINNER OF CHILDREN'S SHOGI TOURNAMENT

00:06:13.936 --> 00:06:16.522
Dad, you promised…

00:06:22.445 --> 00:06:24.363
Don't touch my shogi set!

00:06:35.041 --> 00:06:39.295
That day,
my seven-year-old daughter found the move

00:06:40.338 --> 00:06:42.840
I was searching for my entire life.

00:06:43.883 --> 00:06:45.927
The ultimate move.

00:06:47.845 --> 00:06:51.974
It was no coincidence.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.019
I knew for certain then.

00:06:56.312 --> 00:06:57.355
Asuka was…

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.193
a genius with a gift
that far surpassed me.

00:07:04.111 --> 00:07:08.574
That realization didn't bring me joy.

00:07:09.325 --> 00:07:11.410
Instead, I was shaken to the core.

00:07:13.663 --> 00:07:16.249
My daughter, at seven, already had a gift.

00:07:16.749 --> 00:07:20.461
I was jealous and scared.

00:07:31.222 --> 00:07:33.349
What I saw in the mirror was a monster.

00:07:35.226 --> 00:07:37.895
A monster cursed by shogi.

00:07:39.605 --> 00:07:43.818
And I knew that
if I stayed with my wife and daughter,

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:49.657
I would, without a doubt,
make them miserable.

00:07:50.825 --> 00:07:52.285
That's when I decided.

00:07:52.368 --> 00:07:53.869
DIVORCE APPLICATION

00:07:53.953 --> 00:07:55.454
I don't care anymore…

00:07:56.664 --> 00:07:57.748
about you,

00:08:00.042 --> 00:08:01.085
or Asuka.

00:08:09.719 --> 00:08:10.595
You should…

00:08:11.596 --> 00:08:13.222
stop playing shogi.

00:08:20.354 --> 00:08:21.731
This is right.

00:08:22.732 --> 00:08:26.861
With this, I will be strong.

00:08:28.613 --> 00:08:31.574
I can finally become stronger.

00:08:38.664 --> 00:08:43.753
I had no other choice
but to live as a monster.

00:08:45.379 --> 00:08:47.173
Keiko and Asuka.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.384
I left the two of them…

00:08:51.969 --> 00:08:53.512
my most beloved family.

00:08:59.393 --> 00:09:01.562
And then, I met you.

00:09:03.064 --> 00:09:05.858
You gave me a new life as Shoichi Yuuki.

00:09:12.657 --> 00:09:14.825
But it's all over now.

00:09:16.827 --> 00:09:19.163
Once you retire,
it's the end for the Yuuki family.

00:09:32.218 --> 00:09:35.680
I wonder what Asuka felt
while reading this.

00:09:39.141 --> 00:09:41.352
She's hated her father for abandoning her.

00:09:41.435 --> 00:09:44.105
That has driven her
to keep fighting, right?

00:09:45.773 --> 00:09:46.982
But now…

00:09:53.155 --> 00:09:54.281
Hey.

00:09:54.782 --> 00:09:58.119
Isn't there any way
for Asuka and Shoichi to make up?

00:09:58.953 --> 00:09:59.829
Why should they?

00:09:59.912 --> 00:10:00.913
Because…

00:10:01.914 --> 00:10:03.332
they're family, right?

00:10:04.583 --> 00:10:08.295
Wouldn't they want to get along
rather than fight?

00:10:24.019 --> 00:10:25.354
Mom.

00:10:25.938 --> 00:10:29.316
Are you that scared of
losing Dad to Asuka Kunimi?

00:10:31.402 --> 00:10:33.112
Think of your age.

00:10:33.612 --> 00:10:36.699
Shoichi this, Shoichi that.
You're obsessed with him.

00:10:38.284 --> 00:10:41.078
Do you ever think of anything else?

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:45.291
Hey.

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:48.711
What about me?

00:10:51.964 --> 00:10:53.424
Do you even see me?

00:11:02.224 --> 00:11:03.350
Hey.

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:10.274
Do you know why
I leaked the footage to the tabloids?

00:11:11.776 --> 00:11:13.486
You don't get it, do you?

00:11:16.614 --> 00:11:18.616
Because Dad is all you think about.

00:11:24.872 --> 00:11:26.290
Why?

00:11:29.084 --> 00:11:30.628
Is it because I'm weak?

00:11:32.671 --> 00:11:34.340
Because I'm not as good as Dad?

00:11:38.552 --> 00:11:40.638
Can't you just look at me?

00:11:45.726 --> 00:11:47.561
Say something!

00:11:48.562 --> 00:11:49.522
Tatsuya.

00:12:07.206 --> 00:12:09.625
Don't speak to your parent like that.

00:12:14.213 --> 00:12:15.339
Parent?

00:12:17.091 --> 00:12:22.221
Then act like one
and don't neglect your kid.

00:12:42.658 --> 00:12:43.951
I'm sorry.

00:12:49.707 --> 00:12:51.083
I'm sorry.

00:13:02.261 --> 00:13:03.804
What's up?

00:13:03.887 --> 00:13:05.764
Thinking about dying again?

00:13:07.808 --> 00:13:10.269
Don't you have anywhere else to go?

00:13:11.186 --> 00:13:12.438
Mr. Todou.

00:13:14.523 --> 00:13:18.569
Sorry, but I went ahead and read this.

00:13:24.158 --> 00:13:26.160
"Keiko and Asuka."

00:13:26.243 --> 00:13:28.162
"My most beloved family."

00:13:31.498 --> 00:13:33.417
I don't know what to say.

00:13:35.502 --> 00:13:38.547
What did you think when you read this?

00:13:40.966 --> 00:13:42.426
What about you?

00:13:42.926 --> 00:13:44.178
What did you think?

00:13:48.557 --> 00:13:49.683
As someone who

00:13:50.517 --> 00:13:52.936
was also cursed by shogi,

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:56.982
I understood how he felt.

00:13:58.651 --> 00:13:59.902
Sadly.

00:14:02.029 --> 00:14:03.822
I don't have my own family.

00:14:04.365 --> 00:14:08.994
But if I did,
I might've made the same decision.

00:14:12.289 --> 00:14:16.877
Of course, that doesn't change the fact
that he abandoned you.

00:14:19.296 --> 00:14:20.464
But…

00:14:22.299 --> 00:14:26.929
once you know the truth,
it hits different.

00:14:32.893 --> 00:14:34.353
You and your mother were…

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:38.691
both loved by him.

00:14:39.483 --> 00:14:40.943
Unlike me.

00:14:43.946 --> 00:14:45.155
So…

00:14:46.949 --> 00:14:49.201
there's no need for you to hate him.

00:14:50.119 --> 00:14:53.747
There's no point in taking revenge.

00:14:56.250 --> 00:15:00.587
We should end this. All of it.

00:15:06.176 --> 00:15:07.886
Please…

00:15:09.805 --> 00:15:11.932
Don't take Shoichi away from us.

00:15:22.276 --> 00:15:23.986
"Keiko and Asuka."

00:15:25.279 --> 00:15:27.573
"My most beloved family."

00:15:30.242 --> 00:15:31.243
Yeah.

00:15:35.289 --> 00:15:36.707
I wonder…

00:15:39.168 --> 00:15:43.422
what Mom would've thought
if she read this.

00:15:44.923 --> 00:15:45.883
MOST BELOVED FAMILY

00:15:49.261 --> 00:15:50.596
As for me…

00:15:53.724 --> 00:15:56.060
When I read those words…

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:08.739
I was so pissed!

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:10.324
What?!

00:16:10.407 --> 00:16:13.535
He ruined everything for me and my mom.

00:16:14.745 --> 00:16:17.122
How dare he say those things now?

00:16:17.206 --> 00:16:19.625
Shogi monster? Are you kidding me?

00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:23.504
He's so full of himself!

00:16:23.587 --> 00:16:27.091
A super self-obsessed and selfish bastard,
that's what he is!

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:29.176
But--

00:16:29.259 --> 00:16:30.302
Mr. Todou.

00:16:31.553 --> 00:16:35.974
This is a family feud.

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:40.229
I don't care what other people think.

00:16:40.771 --> 00:16:45.901
Even if the whole country sides with him,
I will never forgive him.

00:16:46.819 --> 00:16:49.738
He put my mom and I in such misery.

00:16:50.739 --> 00:16:52.825
So I'll deny him with all I've got.

00:16:57.371 --> 00:17:01.166
Thanks to those pages,
I've made up my mind.

00:17:04.628 --> 00:17:06.463
I won't become a kishi!

00:17:07.172 --> 00:17:10.717
I'll crush him, and then quit shogi!

00:17:57.389 --> 00:17:58.557
Mom.

00:18:00.642 --> 00:18:02.686
I'm going to end it all.

00:18:10.194 --> 00:18:12.946
The whole nation
is on Shoichi Yuuki's side.

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:16.700
I don't care.

00:18:19.578 --> 00:18:21.455
We are villains after all.

00:18:29.588 --> 00:18:30.964
That’s fine with me.

00:18:31.632 --> 00:18:33.342
Let them all be enemies.

00:18:36.887 --> 00:18:38.180
Asuka.

00:18:38.847 --> 00:18:40.766
You'll be fine. You're strong.

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:45.646
I'll be by your side
all the way to the end of hell.

00:18:50.692 --> 00:18:52.361
Let's beat up your dad.

00:18:56.156 --> 00:18:57.241
Yeah.

00:19:01.203 --> 00:19:08.126
KISHI ADMISSION TEST, BEST OF FIVE
FINAL GAME

00:19:18.804 --> 00:19:19.680
Is she not here yet?

00:19:19.763 --> 00:19:21.932
-What's she doing?
-Anyone talked to her?

00:19:22.015 --> 00:19:25.602
It seems like amateur Asuka Kunimi
has not arrived yet.

00:19:26.395 --> 00:19:29.189
The media has been all over her.

00:19:29.273 --> 00:19:32.567
That must've been quite a huge toll
on her mental health.

00:19:32.651 --> 00:19:36.488
It's possible
she might choose to lose by default.

00:19:37.072 --> 00:19:39.908
The whole country's eyes
are on this kishi admission test.

00:19:39.992 --> 00:19:42.244
What will happen today?

00:19:42.953 --> 00:19:44.246
Will she show up?

00:19:45.414 --> 00:19:46.832
She will.

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:47.601
Well,

00:20:49.478 --> 00:20:50.562
let's begin.

00:20:54.941 --> 00:20:56.610
It is now the scheduled time.

00:20:56.693 --> 00:20:59.696
The final game of
the kishi admission test, best of five.

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:01.365
Please begin the match.

00:21:11.458 --> 00:21:15.712
Amateur Asuka Kunimi.
Her opening move is rook to 5-8.

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:42.114
KING

00:21:42.197 --> 00:21:43.740
Mino Castle.

00:21:44.491 --> 00:21:47.828
I see he's not holding back at all.

00:21:47.911 --> 00:21:51.081
We need him to win
to maintain his honor as the chairman.

00:21:51.706 --> 00:21:53.792
Looks like a solid start.

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:57.087
Hit him!

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:26.867
Knight takes on 8-5.

00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:29.035
Amateur Kunimi is on the offensive.

00:22:29.119 --> 00:22:33.123
Looks like she'll keep pushing here.

00:22:35.959 --> 00:22:38.211
Asuka, I'm sorry.

00:22:38.295 --> 00:22:39.963
All this time…

00:22:40.881 --> 00:22:42.632
I've burdened you.

00:22:42.716 --> 00:22:45.552
I don't care anymore about you,

00:22:46.136 --> 00:22:47.596
or Asuka.

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:49.890
Stop playing shogi.

00:23:01.359 --> 00:23:02.444
Why…

00:23:03.111 --> 00:23:04.362
do you want to see him?

00:23:05.906 --> 00:23:07.741
Because…

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:12.245
we're family.

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:19.085
My mom is dying.

00:23:19.169 --> 00:23:20.545
So…

00:23:21.129 --> 00:23:22.047
Please!

00:23:22.631 --> 00:23:24.216
Please let me see my Dad!

00:23:24.299 --> 00:23:27.552
I need to tell him about her! Please!

00:23:36.269 --> 00:23:38.396
Amateur Kunimi promotes a pawn to 9-1.

00:23:39.147 --> 00:23:41.399
Closing in on Yuuki 9-dan's throat!

00:23:41.483 --> 00:23:42.859
Why?

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:47.405
For a bastard like this…

00:24:13.598 --> 00:24:15.809
Pawn to 8-1. Check.

00:24:15.892 --> 00:24:17.727
Amateur Kunimi is attacking relentlessly.

00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:21.564
You can do it.

00:24:22.148 --> 00:24:26.152
He's in a tough spot.
She's forcing him to retreat.

00:24:26.778 --> 00:24:28.571
An unbelievable turn of events!

00:24:29.072 --> 00:24:33.994
Amateur Kunimi's relentless attacks
seem to be overwhelming Yuuki 9-dan.

00:24:44.838 --> 00:24:47.132
Yuuki 9-dan plays promoted bishop to 5-6.

00:24:47.632 --> 00:24:49.634
He takes amateur Kunimi's rook.

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:53.346
With that, he's stopped her attacks.

00:24:54.097 --> 00:24:57.225
Yuuki 9-dan has completely
turned around the game.

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:02.856
Amateur Kunimi responds with gold to 5-6.

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:06.401
That's exactly
what Yuuki 9-dan had anticipated.

00:25:11.364 --> 00:25:15.201
Yuuki 9-dan moves silver to 2-8. Check.

00:25:22.042 --> 00:25:25.879
Amateur Kunimi flees with king to 4-8.
She looks troubled.

00:25:25.962 --> 00:25:27.464
Damn.

00:25:28.256 --> 00:25:29.257
What's going on?

00:25:29.758 --> 00:25:31.676
He really is a monster.

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:33.094
He's strong.

00:25:36.014 --> 00:25:38.308
The tables have completely turned.

00:25:38.892 --> 00:25:41.728
Looks like Yuuki 9-dan
is launching a skillful attack.

00:25:42.228 --> 00:25:44.064
Amateur Kunimi is the one under siege now…

00:25:45.315 --> 00:25:47.776
Yuuki 9-dan moves promoted knight to 5-8.

00:25:47.859 --> 00:25:49.361
Check again.

00:25:49.444 --> 00:25:51.488
Kunimi's in a really tough spot now.

00:25:51.571 --> 00:25:55.825
Defense looks almost impossible.
Is it over for her?

00:25:55.909 --> 00:25:57.702
That's it, isn't it?

00:25:58.328 --> 00:25:59.537
Impressive.

00:25:59.621 --> 00:26:01.748
Remarkable as usual.

00:26:05.877 --> 00:26:08.922
That's it? Is she going to lose?

00:26:29.401 --> 00:26:34.656
Maybe I was always hoping
for this day to come.

00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:43.581
What's wrong, Asuka? Is this the end?

00:26:57.095 --> 00:26:58.513
What's wrong, Asuka?

00:27:01.057 --> 00:27:02.392
Is this the end?

00:27:06.104 --> 00:27:07.730
You can fly higher.

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:13.361
Fly.

00:27:23.121 --> 00:27:27.041
She's holding on.
Amateur Kunimi escapes with her king.

00:27:27.125 --> 00:27:29.043
That's right. Don't stop.

00:27:29.794 --> 00:27:31.754
Keep going, no matter how unsightly.

00:27:32.755 --> 00:27:36.092
She managed here,
but she's not out of danger yet.

00:27:43.057 --> 00:27:46.769
Lance to 5-7.
Amateur Kunimi is getting cornered.

00:27:46.853 --> 00:27:48.938
She's in an extremely tight position.

00:27:49.022 --> 00:27:52.108
Amateur Kunimi's gold
takes and retreats to 5-7.

00:27:53.318 --> 00:27:55.528
Yuuki 9-dan moves gold to 4-8.

00:27:55.612 --> 00:27:57.614
A crushing check!

00:27:58.281 --> 00:28:00.909
I can't watch anymore!

00:28:01.576 --> 00:28:03.870
He struck the critical point.

00:28:03.953 --> 00:28:06.164
She can't run upward now.
It's looking rough.

00:28:06.247 --> 00:28:07.790
Don't give up.

00:28:09.292 --> 00:28:10.460
You can do it.

00:28:32.774 --> 00:28:36.110
Yuuki 9-dan moves bishop to 8-7. Check.

00:28:36.194 --> 00:28:40.615
He's cornered her with the rook
and bishop. There's no way out.

00:29:05.098 --> 00:29:06.224
It's not over yet!

00:29:06.975 --> 00:29:08.601
How obstinate.

00:29:34.168 --> 00:29:37.005
Bishop to 8-5. Check.

00:29:39.507 --> 00:29:41.050
She turned it around!

00:29:41.885 --> 00:29:44.095
A sudden reversal.

00:29:44.178 --> 00:29:46.139
Yuuki 9-dan was caught off guard.

00:29:46.222 --> 00:29:47.140
Yes!

00:30:28.306 --> 00:30:29.766
Go!

00:30:51.829 --> 00:30:52.705
Go!

00:31:14.185 --> 00:31:15.728
Get him!

00:31:39.127 --> 00:31:40.128
Go.

00:31:40.211 --> 00:31:41.087
Go.

00:31:45.049 --> 00:31:46.092
Take him down!

00:31:48.094 --> 00:31:49.137
ROOK

00:31:54.892 --> 00:31:57.937
Asuka. This is your piece.

00:31:58.521 --> 00:32:01.149
It travels freely as it wishes.

00:32:15.079 --> 00:32:19.208
ROOK

00:32:32.346 --> 00:32:36.809
ROOK

00:33:19.602 --> 00:33:20.770
I resign.

00:33:22.063 --> 00:33:22.939
He resigns!

00:33:23.022 --> 00:33:25.650
Yuuki 9-dan bows his head.
After 129 moves--

00:33:25.733 --> 00:33:28.820
-She won!
-Asuka Kunimi's stunning comeback!

00:33:28.903 --> 00:33:30.363
She really did it.

00:33:30.446 --> 00:33:34.575
The final game of the kishi admission test
ends with amateur Asuka Kunimi's win!

00:33:34.659 --> 00:33:36.994
She makes history
as the first female kishi.

00:33:37.078 --> 00:33:39.497
-She did it!
-This is truly an epoch-making moment!

00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:41.999
-Amazing!
-What an incredible turn of events!

00:33:42.083 --> 00:33:46.712
Indeed, a historic match to mark
the birth of the first female kishi.

00:33:46.796 --> 00:33:52.135
That part aside,
she's simply an incredible player.

00:33:52.218 --> 00:33:53.719
-She did it!
-She'll make history.

00:33:53.803 --> 00:33:57.682
We have just witnessed
the birth of a phenomenal player!

00:34:29.755 --> 00:34:31.591
You've become so strong.

00:34:35.511 --> 00:34:36.637
Asuka.

00:35:20.973 --> 00:35:23.726
I was right,
you're not cut out to be a kishi.

00:35:25.686 --> 00:35:27.897
But you're a great teacher.

00:35:28.773 --> 00:35:30.483
I can tell by looking at her now.

00:35:33.069 --> 00:35:34.362
Yes.

00:35:34.946 --> 00:35:36.739
She is a great student.

00:35:39.659 --> 00:35:41.244
Take care of Asuka.

00:36:23.411 --> 00:36:24.829
I'm sorry.

00:36:27.248 --> 00:36:28.291
No…

00:36:32.086 --> 00:36:33.921
Thank you for everything.

00:37:01.365 --> 00:37:02.616
You did it!

00:37:05.161 --> 00:37:06.162
Oh.

00:37:07.204 --> 00:37:08.331
Yeah.

00:37:09.373 --> 00:37:13.210
That's all? Aren't you excited?

00:37:16.088 --> 00:37:19.091
I thought it would feel more cathartic…

00:37:23.804 --> 00:37:28.017
But I think I said all I needed to.

00:37:30.269 --> 00:37:31.437
I see.

00:37:33.564 --> 00:37:35.483
It was a great family feud.

00:37:43.199 --> 00:37:45.201
It was fun!

00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:52.208
Shall we go home?

00:37:53.542 --> 00:37:54.710
Yes.

00:37:58.005 --> 00:38:02.426
I take full responsibility…

00:38:03.636 --> 00:38:06.055
for all the scandals.

00:38:09.558 --> 00:38:13.020
As of today,

00:38:13.562 --> 00:38:17.400
I resign as the chairman
of the shogi association…

00:38:20.444 --> 00:38:22.822
and retire from being a kishi.

00:38:23.823 --> 00:38:25.366
Chairman Yuuki.

00:38:26.033 --> 00:38:28.619
Thank you for all your hard work
over the years as a kishi.

00:38:29.453 --> 00:38:31.789
"The end" of a kishi…

00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:37.962
Shoichi Yuuki retires
and the first female kishi is born.

00:38:38.838 --> 00:38:41.006
Times are changing.

00:38:41.674 --> 00:38:42.716
Yes.

00:38:43.968 --> 00:38:46.595
Our time is over.

00:38:49.014 --> 00:38:50.516
What are you saying?

00:38:53.602 --> 00:38:55.855
It is the other way around.

00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:58.566
Your time begins now.

00:39:15.875 --> 00:39:17.209
Ms. Asuka Kunimi.

00:39:17.835 --> 00:39:20.379
You've accomplished
becoming the first female kishi.

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:24.258
How do you feel after the final game?

00:39:26.218 --> 00:39:28.304
Well…

00:39:30.556 --> 00:39:33.893
Shogi is really

00:39:35.019 --> 00:39:36.270
annoying.

00:39:37.771 --> 00:39:39.565
So that's why,

00:39:39.648 --> 00:39:40.941
I'm quitting.

00:39:41.025 --> 00:39:43.110
-What?
-Quitting?!

00:39:44.195 --> 00:39:46.989
-Why? You finally made it!
-What do you mean?

00:39:53.370 --> 00:39:57.082
TWO YEARS LATER

00:40:03.214 --> 00:40:04.632
Can I order, please?

00:40:04.715 --> 00:40:06.008
Just a moment.

00:40:07.218 --> 00:40:08.302
Okay.

00:40:09.887 --> 00:40:10.846
Well!

00:40:11.764 --> 00:40:12.640
Look here!

00:40:12.723 --> 00:40:14.266
Thank you for waiting.

00:40:14.350 --> 00:40:18.229
You see, Daddy's working
to pay for your milk.

00:40:18.312 --> 00:40:20.648
I have a title match coming up.
I can't lose!

00:40:20.731 --> 00:40:22.441
That is my main job!

00:40:22.525 --> 00:40:25.861
Bring in money,
and you'll have the right to talk.

00:40:28.614 --> 00:40:30.533
-Seriously!
-What would you like?

00:40:30.616 --> 00:40:32.201
Konrads' spaghetti, please.

00:40:32.284 --> 00:40:33.536
-One?
-Yes.

00:40:34.245 --> 00:40:36.288
-Yes, let me know.
-Reiko.

00:40:36.372 --> 00:40:37.706
Turn the TV on!

00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:38.791
Oh, right!

00:40:38.874 --> 00:40:41.126
-One spaghetti?
-Yes.

00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:42.419
Okay.

00:40:58.394 --> 00:40:59.478
Tatsuya.

00:41:00.312 --> 00:41:01.230
What?

00:41:05.401 --> 00:41:06.735
Want to play?

00:41:07.778 --> 00:41:09.280
It's been a while.

00:41:49.528 --> 00:41:51.280
It's starting soon.

00:42:10.549 --> 00:42:12.718
It's almost time.

00:42:15.304 --> 00:42:18.682
I know. She'll be here soon.

00:42:18.766 --> 00:42:19.642
Noted.

00:42:23.562 --> 00:42:25.314
What's taking so long?

00:42:29.818 --> 00:42:32.237
Oh, you'll go there?

00:42:33.572 --> 00:42:36.575
Then how about this?

00:42:38.994 --> 00:42:39.995
There you are.

00:42:41.538 --> 00:42:42.581
And…

00:43:13.404 --> 00:43:14.530
Great move.

00:43:15.239 --> 00:43:16.782
Got complimented by a kishi!

00:43:17.908 --> 00:43:21.912
What are you doing here?
Don't you have the Ohryu Title Match?

00:43:21.995 --> 00:43:23.330
I'll go after this.

00:43:23.414 --> 00:43:25.040
Hey, master.

00:43:25.124 --> 00:43:27.710
Your opponent's already waiting!

00:43:32.673 --> 00:43:35.843
Shoot. Don't move a piece!

00:43:35.926 --> 00:43:39.388
-Hey!
-You forgot your bag!

00:43:41.306 --> 00:43:42.433
Good luck!

00:43:42.516 --> 00:43:43.559
It won't take long!

00:44:07.958 --> 00:44:09.752
I'm sorry I'm late!

00:44:10.252 --> 00:44:12.087
What were you doing?

00:44:15.799 --> 00:44:16.967
Well…

00:44:19.678 --> 00:44:21.513
I was playing shogi.

00:44:26.518 --> 00:44:28.103
Hurry. Get ready.

00:44:28.187 --> 00:44:29.229
Yes!

00:44:49.792 --> 00:44:55.172
We will now begin
the first game of the Ohryu Title Match.

00:45:01.762 --> 00:45:05.140
Shogi is really

00:45:05.224 --> 00:45:06.767
annoying.

00:45:08.268 --> 00:45:11.438
So that's why, I'm quitting!

00:45:11.522 --> 00:45:13.524
-What?
-Quitting?!

00:45:14.191 --> 00:45:16.902
-Why? You finally made it!
-What do you mean?

00:45:16.985 --> 00:45:18.111
But…

00:45:20.364 --> 00:45:22.157
because it's annoying…

00:45:27.246 --> 00:45:30.916
it's super

00:45:30.999 --> 00:45:32.084
fun!

00:45:33.585 --> 00:45:34.878
Fun?

00:45:43.512 --> 00:45:44.555
Right?

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:07.077
Let's have a good game.

00:46:16.003 --> 00:46:17.629
ROOK

00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:32.853
