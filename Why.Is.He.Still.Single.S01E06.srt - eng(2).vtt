Hey, let me show you
something really funny.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:02.780
Are you ready?

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:03.620
Yes.

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.790
He really wore that hat outside!

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:11.630
Yeah.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.830
And he even thought he looked great.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:16.670
Hey.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.110
But speaking of which,
you two are quite fated.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.670
Fancy running into him on a trip.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.550
What we have is a cursed fate.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.230
Enemies always cross paths.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.460
You don't even know how mean
he was the whole way.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.740
Like a peacock showing off.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.300
Always bragging about how much he knows.

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.950
He even made the tour guide girl cry.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.620
Sounds like you had a terrible
travel experience.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.020
So off-putting.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:42.790
I know.

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.420
Next time you travel, bring me.

00:02:45.506 --> 00:02:47.740
A good travel companion
is the first step to happiness.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.990
True.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.300
Oh, in a few days there'll be
the fireworks festival.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.140
Let's go together.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.460
The fireworks festival...

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.740
Speaking of that,

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.390
last year, I went with my boyfriend.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.460
It's in the past. Time to move on.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.350
How about this?

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.900
If you're afraid it'll be lonely
or bring back memories,

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.300
we can invite more people,
make it livelier.

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:17.860
Sure. It's decided then.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:18.700
Sure.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:24.580
(Son)
Hello, son.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.420
Hi, Mom.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.860
Yejia got your brother-in-law to bring
that fan back for me.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.300
And under the fan,

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.620
she tied a jade pendant
for "peace in all seasons".

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:35.990
Her return gift

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.830
is thoughtful and exquisite.
I really like it.

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.210
Return gift?

00:03:40.262 --> 00:03:41.973
What exactly did you two do
behind my back?

00:03:41.973 --> 00:03:43.390
Alright, don't worry about it.

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:44.390
I'm just telling you.

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:45.740
You need to thank her.

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.860
The girl is so polite.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.270
Hmph, girl?

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:50.550
Hear that?

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:51.830
You must go. Immediately.

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.670
Also, you can't just say "thank you".

00:03:54.751 --> 00:03:55.928
Then what do I do?

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:57.190
Think for yourself.

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.980
(Son)

00:04:12.395 --> 00:04:14.390
The drink you ordered today
is very creative.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.860
Oh, thank you.

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:18.420
And you?

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:19.420
The usual?

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.300
I want to change mine.

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:24.310
Change to what?

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:25.750
Anything.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.100
Alright.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.230
Still here alone?

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:33.500
Aren't you alone too?

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.150
Oh, darling.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.060
Sorry.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.060
I'm late.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.820
Not late. I just arrived too.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.550
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.350
How about watching the fireworks
together on Sunday?

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.230
I booked a suite on the rooftop.

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.910
The fireworks will bloom right
before your eyes.

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.110
So romantic.

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.500
I love it!

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.150
Darling, you're amazing.

00:04:54.262 --> 00:04:55.380
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.820
Fireworks should be watched
with my own woman.

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:02.300
Yes.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.060
Cheers.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.973
(Shanghai International Fireworks Music Festival)
You want to watch fireworks?

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.150
What do you want?

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.710
You can't just say "thank you"
and call it done.

00:05:23.973 --> 00:05:24.950
(I'm telling you all.)

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.670
(I'm not soldering a capacitor,)

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.030
(but sincerity.)

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:30.550
(I believe)

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.990
(the best way to thank someone
is with a gift.)

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:34.860
(But the gift)

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.740
(must be handmade by you.)

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:38.910
(To let the other person feel)

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:40.910
(that you put thought into it.)

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.420
A total of 86 patients
underwent randomization.

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:05.470
Fifty-seven were assigned
to the experimental group.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.150
Twenty-nine were assigned
in the control group.

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:12.620
A pathological complete
response occurred in 37%

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.180
of the patients
in the experimental group,

00:06:18.262 --> 00:06:21.590
and in 7% in the control group.

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:23.380
Thank you for your time.

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.300
It would be our journal
honor to publish your essay.

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:28.550
Pleasure is mine.

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.617
I look forward to meeting you
in person next time.

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:32.860
Thank you. Talk to you soon.
Have a good day.

00:06:36.151 --> 00:06:37.330
Your English is really fluent.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.420
Well, all those years studying abroad
can't go to waste.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:43.140
Paper published?

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:44.430
Yes.

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:45.630
Went smoothly?

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:47.180
Quite smooth, thank you.

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:49.590
What's wrong with you today?

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:51.620
Oh, my stomach.

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:55.230
I didn't feel uncomfortable today.

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:56.940
Oh, right.

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:00.030
My mom likes the jade pendant
you sent to her.

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:01.620
That's great.

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:02.728
As long as Auntie likes it.

00:07:03.773 --> 00:07:04.906
So I think...

00:07:04.906 --> 00:07:06.520
You don't need to give me
any more gifts.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:07.595
Otherwise, it'll never end.

00:07:08.084 --> 00:07:09.470
Who said I'm giving you a gift?

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:15.710
By the way,

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:18.550
I saw that fireworks flyer you had.

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:20.150
I know a really great spot.

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:21.590
Amazing view.

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:24.470
So I've prepared red wine
to watch the fireworks.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:25.710
Sweet on the tongue,

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:26.710
brightness in the eyes,

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.128
and "boom-boom" in the ears.

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:33.900
(Yu Yu)

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:36.870
This is my secret.

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:39.420
Don't tell Xia Xiaoman or Wu.

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:40.260
Absolutely not.

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:42.500
Then why did you send me the location?

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:48.220
You...

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.550
You want me to watch the fireworks
with you.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:52.380
Well...

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:56.670
If you insist on coming with me,

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:57.900
I won't object.

00:07:58.620 --> 00:07:59.460
I'm not going.

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:01.380
Huh?

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:03.573
I already asked Xiaoman
to watch the fireworks with me.

00:08:03.751 --> 00:08:05.240
You're leaving such an important thing

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:07.590
to someone as unreliable as Xia Xiaoman?

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:10.620
She'll probably pick some
overly crowded place,

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:11.620
squeezed with people,

00:08:11.662 --> 00:08:13.928
or some shabby spot
where you can't see anything.

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:16.910
As long as we're together,
we'll have fun.

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:18.328
The fireworks are just decoration.

00:08:18.462 --> 00:08:20.570
Of course, you wouldn't understand
that kind of joy.

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:22.670
I don't need to.

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:25.230
Go on with what you're doing. Bye.

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:47.620
- Hey.
- Hello.

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:48.710
- You're here.
- Hello.

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:49.550
Xiaoxiao.

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:50.590
Alright, you two.

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:52.470
You're the only couple today.

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:53.900
Tone it down a bit.

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:55.820
I'm not really into
all that lovey-dovey stuff.

00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:58.350
It's fine. Let them show off.

00:08:58.350 --> 00:08:59.350
Save it for Dao later.

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:00.380
So frugal.

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:01.380
Xiaoman. Hey!

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:02.260
Hello, you're here.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:03.260
Let me introduce you.

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:04.470
This is Wu.

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:05.660
His girlfriend Xiaoxiao.

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:06.660
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:07.660
I am Song.

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:08.500
I am Ping Yang.

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:11.150
- You're here.
- Hi.

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:12.790
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.140
- You all came.
- Yeah.

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:15.684
Why are you
carrying such a big bag?

00:09:15.728 --> 00:09:17.740
It's full of snacks and drinks.

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:18.660
A treasure stash.

00:09:18.706 --> 00:09:20.830
Don't mention it.
She couldn't sleep at all last night.

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:22.130
Like a kid before a school trip.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:25.500
Alright, everyone's here. Let's go.

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:26.380
Sure!

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:27.684
- Sure.
- Where are we going?

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.860
To the secret base
for watching fireworks.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:37.300
(Panda Construction Engineering Co., Ltd)

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:38.660
What kind of secret base is this?

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.260
Don't look down
on this abandoned building.

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:43.070
The view here is wide open.

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:44.140
Perfect location.

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:46.990
And the best part,
there won't be a single person here.

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:49.190
I've actually heard of

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:50.590
this abandoned building.

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:53.350
It must be great for watching fireworks.

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:56.230
But how did you even find a place
like this?

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:57.380
You're incredible.

00:09:57.860 --> 00:09:59.470
Don't you know who I am?

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:00.950
Come on, let's go.

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:04.380
Right here.

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:06.310
Hey.

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:07.910
Who are you people?

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:10.470
We're just ordinary citizens.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.260
Here to watch the fireworks.

00:10:12.728 --> 00:10:14.240
No. You all should leave now.

00:10:14.262 --> 00:10:16.990
They're doing construction inside.
What fireworks are you trying to see?

00:10:16.995 --> 00:10:18.310
Isn't this an unfinished building?

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:19.540
Our company took it over.

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:20.910
Hurry and leave.

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:22.740
Sorry.

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:27.540
So, what do we do now?

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:30.830
I'm really sorry, everyone.

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:33.140
I'm just too unreliable.

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:28.470
Earlier, you invited me
to watch fireworks.

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:29.470
I turned you down.

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:30.740
Sorry.

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:32.900
Oh, it's fine.

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:36.710
Can I still watch with you?

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:48.590
If you insist on watching with me,

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:50.990
I can only agree out of courtesy.

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:52.660
Thank you.

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:56.110
Wow, this place is really nice.

00:11:59.706 --> 00:12:01.140
Fireworks for just the two of us.

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:02.990
Not only that.

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:03.860
What?

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:04.830
Come here.

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:06.020
This way.

00:12:06.973 --> 00:12:08.590
Didn't I tell you not to tell others?

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:09.590
Isn't it lively now?

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:10.950
No, this is my secret spot.

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:12.190
Sharing brings more joy.

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:14.140
Xia Xiaoman is really unreliable.

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:15.540
Mr. Yu.

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:18.500
Wow, this place is amazing.

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:20.500
Wow, it's absolutely perfect.

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:21.860
It's okay.

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:24.440
Still a bit worse than my spot.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.350
Not bad, Mr. Yu. Impressive.

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:28.590
Well, Mr. Yu.

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:30.430
How did you even find this secret base?

00:12:31.195 --> 00:12:33.380
The owner of this building
is my college classmate.

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:34.590
He lent it to me.

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:36.710
- Oh.
- Wow.

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:40.110
Although Mr. Yu didn't invite us
to watch fireworks before,

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:41.540
this time we're lucky thanks to you.

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:42.540
We get to see them now.

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:44.860
- Thank you, Mr. Yu.
- Thank you, Mr. Yu.

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:47.070
Hey.

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:48.740
This is pretty nice.

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:51.190
Why don't we just eat here?

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:52.230
Sure, let's do it.

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:54.900
Let's see what you brought.

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:06.310
How does it feel to be thanked?

00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:07.430
Not bad.

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:10.310
Look how happy they are.

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:11.660
It's all because of you.

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:16.780
Sorry for sharing your secret.

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:19.620
- Wow!
- Wow!

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:25.780
Wow, look!

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:28.500
It's huge!

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:29.470
That one just now!

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:30.660
Wow!

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:32.190
There!

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:44.430
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:46.660
I really didn't expect
to see fireworks like this.

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:10.070
Take this.

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:10.950
What's this?

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:11.790
A VR headset.

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:13.340
I built a shuttle device.

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:14.573
It works great for fireworks.

00:14:14.595 --> 00:14:15.230
Try it.

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:18.380
- What about you?
- I've got one too.

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:19.380
You have two?

00:14:19.706 --> 00:14:20.770
Buy one, and get one free.

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:22.900
Why can't I see anything?

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:24.380
You'll see in a moment.

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:26.460
Here it comes.

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:43.150
Wow!

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:03.070
Wow!

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:05.620
Beautiful, right?

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:07.070
So beautiful.

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:10.070
Too beautiful! So dreamy!

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:24.380
So this is what fireworks look like
through your eyes.

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:26.020
This is way too cool.

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:28.860
Send me the video?

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:31.830
For a price,
later, we'll treat you to a dinner.

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:33.710
I can give you the video for sure.

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:34.860
But dinner... Forget it.

00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:36.860
I have to go home to wash clothes today,

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:37.860
and tidy up the house.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:39.860
Work's been way too busy lately.

00:16:39.906 --> 00:16:41.259
I haven't cleaned for so long.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:42.140
Well...

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:42.980
Alright then.

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:45.980
Hey.

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:48.020
Since when did you learn to eavesdrop?

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:49.860
I didn't.

00:16:50.862 --> 00:16:52.530
You still have three minutes
before work.

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:54.020
So I'm waiting for you.

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:57.310
Mr. Yu is back at the hospital again.

00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:58.430
Don't speak.

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:00.140
Let's disappear.

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:01.670
Hurry, go.

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:04.150
Hello, Mr. Yu.

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:05.580
Thank you for your hard work, Mr. Yu.

00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:06.420
Gone again?

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:12.270
Sit down.

00:17:17.884 --> 00:17:18.830
Where does it hurt now?

00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:22.020
I still have a headache and neck pain.

00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:24.060
So I came to ask you
for some painkillers.

00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:25.580
You finished the painkillers

00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:26.906
I gave you last time so quickly?

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:27.870
I finished them,

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:31.340
so I came to ask
for stronger painkillers.

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.740
Medicine can't be prescribed recklessly.

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:36.430
And many pains heal on their own.

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:37.990
You must not...

00:17:37.995 --> 00:17:39.617
Make a big deal out of it, right?

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:42.950
Not very accurate,
but roughly means that.

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:44.220
Wait...

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:47.060
Do you often have patients
who make a big deal out of small things

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:48.060
come to see you?

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:51.190
So that makes you too tired
to do housework.

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:54.300
You said you didn't eavesdrop on others.

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:58.100
Besides, so what if I'm busy
and too tired to do housework?

00:17:58.540 --> 00:17:59.470
Hmph.

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:00.470
I am this kind of person.

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:02.260
No matter how tired,
I will do housework.

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:04.740
I am very diligent and love cleanliness.

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:07.670
That means your home
must be very tidy and clean.

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:08.510
Of course.

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:10.740
But very regrettably,

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:13.020
I cannot invite you to my home,

00:18:13.284 --> 00:18:15.630
because I'm not used
to letting outsiders into my room.

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:19.710
So regrettable.

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:21.310
You may leave.

00:18:23.462 --> 00:18:25.500
Anyway, people who say they don't
like housework

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:26.870
or can't do housework are,

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:28.500
in one word, lazy.

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:31.390
Headache.

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:34.300
Headache? I have medicine.

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:36.910
I'm being sarcastic.

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:38.820
I'm just joking.

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:41.270
Goodbye.

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:48.100
Who wants to go to your home?

00:18:55.940 --> 00:19:00.460
(House renovation bill of quantities
and pricing table)

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:01.500
In such a short time,

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:03.390
how can such a complex project
be completed?

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:04.470
Isn't that ridiculous?

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:08.100
Ou Yang said he wouldn't do it.

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:10.020
I had no choice either,

00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:11.260
so I came over

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:12.950
to find you.

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:14.940
Ou Yang, huh?

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:15.830
Hmph.

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:18.470
He said this goes against the rules
of creation.

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:20.140
It can't be done.

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:22.630
This time he's right.

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:25.780
Other designers said the same thing.

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:27.260
Otherwise,

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:29.340
should I just drop it? Forget it.

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:30.180
Wait.

00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:31.180
Don't drop it.

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:33.510
I'll take it.

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:38.060
A project no one can complete.

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:39.740
If I complete it on time,

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:40.630
what does that mean?

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:42.780
It means slapping them in the face,

00:19:42.906 --> 00:19:45.100
and it also means you are
more capable than them.

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:47.820
You would be the designer of the year.

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:48.940
Exactly.

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:52.780
Oh, have you thought it through?

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:54.740
What if you don't finish?

00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:57.470
Piece of cake.

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:01.310
Oh.

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:04.950
Wu, aren't you setting up Mr. Yu?

00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:06.030
I'm not.

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:11.580
(People always need
some difficult challenges)

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:12.706
(to motivate themselves.)

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:14.780
(Success lets you show off,)

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:16.740
(and failure lets you be playful.)

00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:20.470
(All for hope that there is
something only you can do.)

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:22.780
(It makes you feel safe,)

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:24.780
(like finding your place)

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:26.340
(in a crowded subway.)

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:30.540
(Wanting to be unique among billions,)

00:20:30.662 --> 00:20:32.373
(this is the root of inner struggle.)

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:35.060
(Torturing yourself,)

00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:37.260
(any obstacle can be overcome.)

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:40.950
(But remember to lift your feet first.)

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:50.910
No inspiration?

00:20:51.373 --> 00:20:52.740
How could I have no inspiration?

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:54.140
Go do your work.

00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:56.990
(I have no work.)

00:20:57.306 --> 00:20:59.430
(I have to wait for you
to finish the design drawing.)

00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:00.270
(Got it.)

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:03.830
(Mr. Yu.)

00:21:04.084 --> 00:21:06.060
(The client didn't want it to be
that perfect.)

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:07.390
(Stop being pretentious.)

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:08.630
(What pretentious?)

00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:10.630
(This is a dedication to art.)

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:40.340
It's you.

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:41.230
Where are you going?

00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:42.662
I'm going to Xia Xiaoman's place.

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:45.100
Hey, following someone like that
is scary.

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:46.500
Why not greet me?

00:21:46.573 --> 00:21:48.300
After greeting,
if there's nothing to say,

00:21:48.373 --> 00:21:49.540
wouldn't it be more awkward?

00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:51.060
Haven't seen you for days.

00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:52.506
Have you gone crazy from overtime?

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:54.870
Overtime is for the inefficient.

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:56.340
I don't do overtime.

00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:58.340
Let's go.

00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:10.230
See?

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:32.190
Wu, what are you doing here?

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:34.580
Dr. Gu, I'm waiting for Mr. Yu.

00:22:35.662 --> 00:22:36.740
Why is he so far from you?

00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:38.990
Sick again. Continue your work.

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:40.820
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:45.020
Fighting again?

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:46.820
Hmph, actually the opposite.

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:49.230
To avoid awkward silence,

00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:50.500
I stay away from her.

00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:52.500
But don't you talk a lot with her?

00:22:52.884 --> 00:22:54.030
What are you doing here?

00:22:57.390 --> 00:22:58.260
Mr. Yu.

00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:00.740
You must finish this design today.

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:02.870
Otherwise, I won't have time
for the mock-up.

00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:04.260
So I came to help you.

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:05.820
I even brought my laptop.

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:07.630
Are you questioning my ability?

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:10.390
No, I'm just sharing the workload.

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:12.060
Enough, go back now.

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:13.780
I came all this way,
so just let me go up.

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:16.340
- You knew I wouldn't let you in, yet you came.
- Breaking the rule for work once.

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:17.430
Either in the hallway,

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:18.670
or Xia Xiaoman's place.

00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:19.540
Pick one.

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:22.870
Then I'll work overtime at the office.

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:24.340
Why not do it at home?

00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:26.390
Home is where I live with my girlfriend.

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:28.300
I can't bring work home.

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:30.990
Hmph. It's clearly because there's
no private space.

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:32.190
See how good I have it.

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:33.500
Free and easy at home.

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:35.020
No one bothers me. Jealous, huh?

00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:36.500
Sick again.

00:23:36.884 --> 00:23:37.995
- Come back.
- Goodbye.

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:46.540
Ta-da.

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:48.260
This is my newly
invented vegetable rice.

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:51.060
It looks black but tastes great.

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:53.540
Indeed, it's very black. Can I eat it?

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:54.580
Yes.

00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:56.150
Here, try it.

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:00.340
Try it.

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:01.710
Thank you.

00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:06.070
Mmm.

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:08.300
Xiaoman, you're amazing.

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:09.740
Cooking so well

00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:11.340
and inventing new things.

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:12.340
I really admire you.

00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:15.710
I think my future husband
will be very happy.

00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:19.540
Because I will take care
of everything at home.

00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:21.150
Let him fully

00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:22.630
focus on his career.

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:25.430
I think behind every successful man,

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:27.300
there's a strong woman.

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:30.230
That said,

00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:32.100
you want to be a full-time housewife.

00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:35.260
Yes, and I don't need him to spend much.

00:24:35.306 --> 00:24:36.670
I'm not trying to take advantage.

00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:38.300
I think each month

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:40.630
it's enough if he brings back
living expenses.

00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:42.190
Any leftovers we save.

00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:44.060
So we can gradually manage

00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:45.230
and feel at home.

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:48.710
I think you'll be a great wife.

00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:49.990
I think so too.

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:51.150
What a pity.

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:53.300
No one appreciates it.

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:55.190
Otherwise, I'd marry you.

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:57.630
Or tomorrow we could register?

00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:01.990
But I never knew

00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:04.540
what kind of man you like?

00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:06.340
Me?

00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:09.300
I want a man
who is ambitious in his career,

00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:11.990
but also willing to share housework
with me.

00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:14.260
In today's world,

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:15.500
such men are rare.

00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:16.790
There are.

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:17.860
Who?

00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:20.430
(Facing time pressure,)

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:22.300
(higher work efficiency is needed.)

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:24.630
(Staying calm and focused)

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:25.470
(is the key.)

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:28.020
(Choose a quiet work environment,)

00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:29.820
(and allocate time for each task.)

00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:55.950
Really.

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:58.470
I think Mr. Yu actually
likes doing housework.

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:01.020
He does laundry more diligently than I do.

00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:02.540
He did tell me

00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:05.740
that he keeps his home neat and clean,

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:07.430
tidy and spotless.

00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:08.950
Have you been inside?

00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:11.670
No, but I heard from Shen Wu

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:13.430
that he doesn't let anyone in.

00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:14.540
So strange.

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:17.230
Now I'm curious.

00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:39.660
Xiaoman.

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:42.340
I'm wondering why you always cry poor.

00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:43.630
You spend so much money

00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:45.670
buying luxury shoes and bags.

00:26:47.484 --> 00:26:49.540
Even have these limited-edition
red-soled shoes.

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:53.100
I call it "exquisite poverty".

00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:02.150
Why are you staring at me?

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:04.430
Stay here tonight.

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:07.230
I'll let you experience
princess treatment.

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:50.230
Jia, you're amazing.

00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:54.630
I worked hard on my makeup.

00:27:55.150 --> 00:27:56.820
Gotta show it off.

00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:59.710
Or scare him?

00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:33.340
What's this?

00:28:36.462 --> 00:28:37.580
What are you recording?

00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:39.230
What are you two doing?

00:28:44.084 --> 00:28:45.528
Why are you dressed like that?

00:28:45.573 --> 00:28:46.740
Going to sing "Night Shanghai"?

00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:48.950
Wearing that mask,

00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:50.528
planning a Sichuan opera face-change?

00:28:50.528 --> 00:28:51.470
I really can.

00:28:58.220 --> 00:28:59.060
Give up, huh?

00:28:59.060 --> 00:28:59.900
You win.

00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:03.500
This dish is made by Xiaoman. Try it.

00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:07.780
Even you can't finish it.

00:29:07.862 --> 00:29:09.060
Then it must be terrible.

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:11.060
So will you eat it or not?

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:12.910
If you insist I eat,

00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:14.150
I'll just eat a little.

00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:22.530
We have

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:24.910
a question to ask you.

00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:26.660
Go ahead.

00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:29.990
Why don't you let anyone into your home?

00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:32.100
Good question.

00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:35.950
Home can be a place

00:29:35.995 --> 00:29:37.540
to separate from this troublesome world.

00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:40.260
It's an independent, private space.

00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:42.820
Like male leads
in fantasy martial-arts drama.

00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:46.190
They cultivate alone
in their secret rooms.

00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:47.030
Understand?

00:29:55.390 --> 00:29:57.300
Then, sorry to disturb you.

00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:59.470
Please continue your cultivation.

00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:06.340
He's really strange.

00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:08.470
Grown up and still wearing a mask.

00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:11.870
I made a meme of him, look.

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:15.780
You're so talented.

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:17.150
Even put the hat in.

00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:18.670
I'll post it in our group chat.

00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:50.100
Mr. Yu, it's so late, still not here?

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:51.100
What's going on?

00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:52.870
It's 10:30 AM.

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:10.470
Wu, coffee, double shot.

00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:24.310
Triple.

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:27.270
- Hey, you.
- Mr. Yu.

00:31:29.617 --> 00:31:31.060
You don't need to say anything.

00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:32.780
Trust me, I can finish quickly.

00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:35.020
You don't need to do this work anymore.

00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:36.630
What?

00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:38.340
You don't have to do it.

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:39.470
What?

00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:40.740
This place is nice.

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:44.430
How are you here?

00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:48.100
Because you didn't finish work on time.

00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:49.950
According to headquarters,

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:52.020
this place is now managed by Ou Yang.

00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:53.260
You're no longer needed.

00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:55.820
Effective now, immediately.

00:31:56.551 --> 00:31:59.390
This contract officially
takes effect at noon.

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:05.500
One minute left.

00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:07.310
What?

00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:09.030
No.

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:10.710
This is my studio.

00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:12.230
Even if I didn't finish work on time,

00:32:12.395 --> 00:32:13.950
you can't just dismiss me so recklessly.

00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:15.100
No need to explain.

00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:17.020
See for yourself.

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:19.440
If you don't understand,
get a lawyer to teach you.

00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:22.380
Also,

00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:26.780
this woman is mine now.

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:27.860
What?

00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:29.780
Please take good care of me.

00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:31.100
Lin Sa, you...

00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:32.340
Hey, you.

00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:34.190
He's also mine from now on.

00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:36.470
Triple of yours.

00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:39.580
Sorry.

00:32:40.390 --> 00:32:41.230
Just black tea.

00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:42.630
Oh, very sorry.

00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:46.190
One minute has passed.

00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:48.910
Mr. Yu, you should leave.

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:51.300
- I...
- From now on,

00:32:51.630 --> 00:32:54.300
this is Ou Yang's studio.

00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:58.820
This thing looks so annoying.

00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:00.900
Throw it away.

00:33:00.910 --> 00:33:01.790
Right now.

00:33:01.810 --> 00:33:02.690
Coming.

00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:03.860
Wu.

00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:08.100
Wu, don't!

00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:14.860
Who?

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:19.380
Who?

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:32.990
Hi.

00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:36.070
What are you doing here?

00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:37.740
Ou Yang is too flirtatious.

00:33:37.910 --> 00:33:39.820
We decided to ditch that guy.

00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:42.630
Just saw you feeding him fruit earlier.

00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:43.910
For you too.

00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:46.390
From now on, we follow you.

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:48.340
Obedient in everything.

00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:49.630
Do whatever you ask.

00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:50.910
I don't need that.

00:33:50.910 --> 00:33:51.950
You do.

00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:03.430
It's already 2:14 AM.

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:08.180
Delays are terrifying.

00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:46.150
This...

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:47.500
What's that sound?

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:50.140
What's meant to come will come.

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:53.750
Why is he so annoying?

00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:24.350
(Keeping promises)

00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:26.310
(isn't easy,)

00:35:26.884 --> 00:35:28.350
(but things promised to others)

00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:29.790
(must be fulfilled.)

00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:33.060
(Showing off is scary.)

00:35:58.790 --> 00:35:59.790
Why are you panicking?

00:35:59.973 --> 00:36:01.973
Waiting for you to release
the second half.

00:36:01.995 --> 00:36:03.270
We couldn't sleep all night.

00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:04.180
Now we're late.

00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:05.100
We're like this now...

00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:06.220
It's all your fault.

00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:08.470
You look like those two women.

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:10.140
Who?

00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:11.020
The women in my dream.

00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:12.470
Ugh.

00:36:18.862 --> 00:36:20.540
I'm very disappointed
in you two traitors.

00:36:21.310 --> 00:36:22.150
What?

00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:24.790
When did we betray you?

00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:26.390
Traitors, don't talk to me.

00:36:27.790 --> 00:36:29.100
He's just late.

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:30.020
Saving face.

00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:32.100
Just blaming us to distract.

00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:35.950
But it's rare that Mr. Yu is late.

00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:37.180
Design plan, done.

00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:39.310
Alright.

00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:46.870
Mr. Yu, are you tired?

00:36:46.884 --> 00:36:48.350
Want me to pour you some black tea?

00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:49.790
Absolutely not.

00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:51.660
Just say it.

00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:52.500
Why so fierce?

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:54.310
I want coffee, triple shot.

00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:07.270
The design plan is done.

00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:10.620
Can the materials and construction plan
be finished today?

00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:13.540
- Yes.
- If not finished,

00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:15.070
tomorrow I can't hand it to the foreman.

00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:15.950
Then our start time...

00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:16.990
I said I can.

00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:26.420
Well...

00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:28.910
Mr. Yu is quite irritable today.

00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:31.430
Menopause?

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:32.870
Getting older.

00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:35.860
Well...

00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:38.140
Ou Yang called me this morning.

00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:41.540
He said he wants to help
finish this project.

00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:42.750
Don't mention him to me.

00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:45.180
Third and final time I say it,

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:46.660
I can do it myself.

00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:51.830
Where's my coffee?

00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:56.230
Hmph.

00:37:56.990 --> 00:37:57.950
Two traitors.

00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:02.540
Scald you.

00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:08.420
Hmph.

00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:30.060
It's past ten at night and
still drinking this, not sleeping?

00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:33.990
Is it ten already?

00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:37.140
Thirty-six yuan in total.

00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:53.540
(Emergency)

00:38:56.910 --> 00:38:58.580
Over fatigue. Nothing serious.

00:38:58.706 --> 00:39:00.350
Rest for a few days, and he'll be fine.

00:39:01.350 --> 00:39:02.540
Over fatigue?

00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:04.500
Probably from staying up late.

00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:07.390
Then why did he suddenly faint?

00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:08.790
Low blood sugar?

00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:10.020
Not really.

00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:11.220
He drank a lot of Red Bull,

00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:12.950
so he wouldn't have low blood sugar.

00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:16.500
But extreme anxiety can affect appetite.

00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:18.020
Right.

00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:19.420
Yes.

00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:23.220
I can't eat when I talk to Mom
about his marriage.

00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:25.390
I can hear.

00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:26.990
That's great.

00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:32.990
I'm fine now.

00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:33.910
I'm going to work.

00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:35.700
That won't do.

00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:38.580
Dr. Gu said your
blood pressure is unstable.

00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:39.470
Irregular heartbeat.

00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:41.350
You must rest for 48 hours.

00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:43.220
Don't listen to her.

00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:45.310
She's a doctor after all.

00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:46.660
Or you can listen to me.

00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:47.580
I'm a doctor too.

00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:48.870
You're even less reliable.

00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:50.950
Mr. Yu, you don't need to rush.

00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:52.790
Ms. Lin just told me

00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:55.310
that Ou Yang will help us
complete this project.

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:56.340
Ou Yang?

00:39:59.100 --> 00:39:59.940
Forget it.

00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:01.580
Anyway, the main design

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:03.060
is almost finished.

00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:04.270
Only materials

00:40:04.270 --> 00:40:05.350
and pricing issues are left.

00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:08.140
Even if he's stupid,
he should handle it.

00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:10.660
Where's Lin Sa?

00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:15.180
Lin is in a meeting with Ou Yang.

00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:20.100
Such a simple thing,
still hand-holding him?

00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:23.420
Well...

00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:25.700
The condition for Ou Yang to take over

00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:28.540
is to change your design.

00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:32.500
What are you doing?

00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:33.750
I want to stop him.

00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:35.660
Are you insane? You need to rest.

00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:36.790
Mr. Yu, calm down.

00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:38.220
That work is already Ou Yang's.

00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:39.310
Stop talking. Move aside.

00:40:39.310 --> 00:40:40.750
No, Mr. Yu.

00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:41.590
What are you doing?

00:40:41.862 --> 00:40:43.950
You didn't stop Ou Yang
from changing my design,

00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:44.990
but you stopped me instead?

00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:46.500
Aren't you supposed to rest?

00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:47.340
Move aside.

00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:50.940
Yu Yu!

00:40:50.995 --> 00:40:52.060
What did you just call me?

00:40:52.573 --> 00:40:54.390
You're disrespectful!
What are you doing?

00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:56.500
It's not that I'm doing anything.
You should rest.

00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:57.660
- Move aside!
- I won't!

00:40:57.660 --> 00:40:58.750
Go away, don't block me!

00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:00.310
Stop being so willful!

00:41:00.310 --> 00:41:01.540
Listen, I'm your apprentice.

00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:02.750
I have to look after you.

00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:03.990
Then don't be my apprentice.

00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:05.060
Get out!

00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:21.100
What's wrong with you?

00:41:21.350 --> 00:41:22.470
Don't block me either.

00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:24.500
Yu.

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:25.790
Don't be mad.

00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:27.430
Yu, sit.

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:29.100
Rest well.

00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:30.430
Come, lie down.

00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:31.270
Rest well.

00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:33.990
(A designer)

00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:35.950
(who doesn't finish work on time)

00:41:36.090 --> 00:41:38.140
(ends up having their design
changed by someone else.)

00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:39.220
(Truly a failure.)

00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:56.700
You got fired just like that?

00:41:57.390 --> 00:41:58.870
Can I still ask about this?

00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:00.990
But it doesn't sound quite right.

00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:03.990
Shall I ask for you again?

00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:05.430
Forget it.

00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:06.750
I won't trouble you with this.

00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:09.390
Then why didn't you tell your girlfriend

00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:10.620
and call us out?

00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:13.750
I don't want to bring
this negative mood home.

If you don't bring it home,
bring it to us, huh?

00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:17.540
