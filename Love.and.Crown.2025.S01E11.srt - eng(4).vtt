00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:55.700

nothing is certain yet.

Your Majesty is indeed

the finest student I have ever taught.

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:22.180
This strike, sharp and decisive,

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:23.060
is fine play.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.730
It is Grand Tutor's teachings that were fine.

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:28.940
But Grand Tutor need not worry.

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:31.100
In me,

Yes, Your Majesty.

Have you decided?

00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:39.530
Will you truly retrieve the Moon-Eclipse?

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.180
You are right.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:46.980
Only if the Moon-Eclipse is in my hands

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.130
will it be safest.

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:51.300
I must destroy it myself.

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:29.900
We must leave first.

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.290
We will destroy the Moon-Eclipse later.

The assassin who threatened the Empress has been seized.

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:02.530
This was found on his person.

00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:11.140
He did not threaten me.

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:12.460
I summoned him.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.220
Are you certain

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:16.460
you have not been deceived by this thief?

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.140
The one who deceived me...

Was it not you?

Your Majesty speaks the sweetest words,

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:30.810
yet does the things that hurt me most.

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:34.700
I was a fool.

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.250
Time and again I let you deceive me,

You should never trust him.

Take him away.

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:57.180
Yes.

I told you the fault is not his.

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:03.570
This matter has nothing to do with him.

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:04.810
The fault lies with me.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.250
The one who deceived me...

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:37.810
Was it not you?

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.010
Your Majesty speaks the sweetest words,

you may speak plainly.

If one drinks this wine,

00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:26.420
it will make one

It is from the heart.

Very well.

I wish nothing more than to have him torn apart.

Yet you ask me to spare him?

00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:48.460
Then let me hate you.

Swear to guard the border to the last!

In the ninth year of Yongxi,

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.530
Kumor, Prince of Xijiang,

00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:50.460
resented the census decree,

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:52.250
and marched to besiege Jiangzhou.

00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:54.860
Ling Jueding, Governor of Jiangzhou,

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:56.050
led the troops in defense,

00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:57.530
and repelled the foe again and again.

00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:00.250
But Kumor's advance was relentless.

00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:01.810
Jiangzhou was in peril.

Your Majesty.

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:26.810
Kumor harbors ill intent.

00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:29.770
Jiangzhou lies barely a thousand li from the Capital.

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:31.180
If left unchecked,

the danger may reach the Capital itself.

Your Majesty dispatch troops to aid Jiangzhou.

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:51.770

the plague must be

as for the stored grain,

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:30.180
we have less than eight hundred thousand dan left.

00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:32.220
If we reinforce Jiangzhou,

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:35.460
Xuzhou's relief may have to be delayed.

00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:38.180
If Your Majesty sends troops to Jiangzhou,

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:40.490
the Capital's guards must be mobilized.

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:43.460
Xuzhou is barely a thousand li away.

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:46.050
If the people there cannot be appeased,

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:47.010
and unrest follows,

00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:50.530
the Capital will be left vulnerable.

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:52.730
Grand Tutor Ling,

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:54.730
what say you?

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:04.990
In my view,

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:06.530
Your Majesty should send aid,

00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:09.460
and reinforce Jiangzhou.

00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:12.490
And what of Xuzhou?

00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:14.990
Xuzhou holds but disaster victims.

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:16.220
But Jiangzhou

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:18.860
is the land of Great Qi.

00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:24.700
General Ling Jueding

00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:26.570
won fame from youth,

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:28.460
commanding the entire Western Garrison.

00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:30.290
To defend Jiangzhou

00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:32.050
is hardly beyond him.

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:35.380
General Ling guards Jiangzhou for Your Majesty,

00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:37.180
loyal and steadfast.

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:45.090
Grand Tutor Ling,

00:32:46.510 --> 00:32:47.810
what are you implying?

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:50.290
No one trusts General Ling

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:51.900
more than I do.

00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:53.860
Else why would the command tally

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:55.570
rest in his hands to this day?

00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.380
Would you not agree, Grand Tutor Ling?

00:32:58.750 --> 00:33:00.140
Indeed,

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:01.700
Your Majesty.

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:06.180
Xuzhou is in crisis.

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:07.940
I cannot ignore it.

00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:10.570
Yet Jiangzhou must be held.

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:11.730
Otherwise,

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:14.250
even General Ling's life would not absolve him.

00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:23.700
This matter is difficult.

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:25.810
I shall ponder it for two more days.

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:28.770
We await Your Majesty's decree.

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:52.770
The Imperial Preceptor says

00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:54.490
Your Majesty is gravely ill and must rest.

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:55.610
No one may enter.

00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:57.250
Commander Li.

00:33:57.310 --> 00:33:59.420
You've no idea how chaotic it is outside.

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:01.420
One group after another is demanding entry.

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:03.050
I can't hold them off.

00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:04.420
They're either imperial kin,

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:05.810
or high ministers of court.

00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:07.810
Not a single one I dare offend.

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:09.900
You mustn't offend any of them.

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:12.490
So the one you can offend is me?

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:21.650
Your Majesty,

00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:23.460
I would never dare.

00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:26.090
Then hurry back out and face them.

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:26.860
I...

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:29.570
Well.

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:38.780
So Your Majesty claims illness

00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:41.490
only to hide here in Nanrong Palace for peace and quiet.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:43.820
Are you saying

00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:45.260
that I'm not ill?

00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:46.780
Your Majesty is ill indeed.

00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:48.690
Then Your Majesty must rest

00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:49.900
as a sick man should,

00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:51.490
and not burden your mind.

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:54.530
Though Your Majesty is here,

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:55.690
the thoughts

00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:57.210
are still in turmoil.

00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:00.340
This does no good for Your Majesty's ailment.

00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:02.570
This is a critical time.

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:04.690
I cannot relax for a moment.

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:06.980
I must save Jiangzhou's soldiers and people.

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:10.130
Yet I cannot abandon the people of Xuzhou either.

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:12.900
Behind Ling Xuefeng,

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:15.210
stands an entire host of noble clans.

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:16.610
I know this all too well.

00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:18.530
If I don't force his hand,

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:20.650
he'll surely abandon Xuzhou

00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:21.690
to protect Jiangzhou.

00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:23.340
I

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:25.300
must take this gamble with him.

00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:29.860
His Majesty has feigned illness and hidden in Nanrong Palace.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:32.780
I expected it.

00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:37.210
Why aren't you peeling the grapes?

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:40.820
These mare-milk grapes must be eaten with the skin

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:41.900
to keep their crispness.

00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:43.940
I'll take the rest with me.

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:47.260
You've only just sat down and already you're leaving.

00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:49.650
Didn't I report everything to you earlier?

00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:52.380
I strongly opposed sending troops in court.

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:55.380
His Majesty seemed inclined to agree.

00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:58.610
That Ling Xuefeng looked quite distressed.

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:02.170
Ling Jueding holds the military power.

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:05.650
If he loses his standing in this campaign,

00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:09.090
Ling Xuefeng will be as if cut from his right arm.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.940
Naturally His Majesty will be pleased.

00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:13.780
So you think

00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:17.490
His Majesty would abandon Jiangzhou?

00:36:20.590 --> 00:36:21.380
What is it?

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:23.210
You don't think so?

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:24.570
Mother,

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:26.010
what are you imagining?

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:27.690
If Jiangzhou falls,

00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:30.780
who could bear such infamy for all time?

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:33.940
Ling Jueding has guarded Jiangzhou for years.

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:36.490
There is no one who knows that land better.

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:40.570
His Majesty would never strip him of command at such a time.

00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:44.490
Then why stage all of this?

00:36:45.590 --> 00:36:47.650
The people of Xuzhou are people all the same.

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:49.780
What did you say?

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:53.260
Nothing.

00:36:54.110 --> 00:36:54.980
Mother is wise.

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:56.570
I shall take my leave.

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:07.170
Is

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:09.380
the Empress's confinement not yet lifted?

00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:10.690
Yes.

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:12.900
With Jiangzhou in peril,

00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:15.460
as the older sister of Young General Ling,

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:18.860
how could she not know?

00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:23.940
And if she knew His Majesty refused to send reinforcements,

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:26.940
what would she think then?

00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:37.650
Your Majesty,

00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:39.090
Aunt Chan has arrived.

00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:58.130
Your Majesty is confined and copying sutras.

00:37:58.190 --> 00:37:59.690
It must drain your spirit.

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:01.690
The Empress Dowager pities you,

00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:03.610
so Her Majesty prepared medicinal dishes

00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:04.740
and sent me to deliver them.

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:10.650
Thank the Empress Dowager for her kindness.

00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:14.010
I must continue copying.

00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:16.340
Aunt Chan may go.

00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:20.300
Perhaps Your Majesty hasn't heard.

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:23.820
Something has happened in Jiangzhou.

00:38:27.110 --> 00:38:27.940
What did you say?

00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:30.110
[Nanrong Palace]

00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:30.860
Move aside.

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:31.940
I must see His Majesty.

00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:34.340
Your Majesty!

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:36.090
I know you're inside!

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:37.820
Come out!

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:39.130
Your Majesty!

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:41.380
Why will you not send aid to Jiangzhou?

00:38:42.590 --> 00:38:43.380
Your Majesty.

00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:45.820
Your Majesty!

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:47.010
It seems the Empress

00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:48.900
already knows of Jiangzhou.

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:53.130
Since Your Majesty has chosen this political gamble,

00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:55.260
you must lay down your stake.

00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:56.900
Your Majesty,

00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:59.610
you must not soften because of the Empress.

00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:02.860
What lies between me and the Empress

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:04.900
needs no comment from you.

00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:24.740
Did the Grand Tutor

00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:26.210
send you to seek me out?

00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:27.940
My father?

00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:31.130
What has this to do with him?

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:32.260
I came on my own.

00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:33.210
It has nothing to do with my father.

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:36.130
My father would never use me as you do.

00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:41.780
I was just about to leave the palace.

00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:43.650
Come with me.

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:03.980
Come out!

00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:24.820
Luo?

00:40:38.110 --> 00:40:39.420
You managed to find this place.

00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:41.740
I told you

00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:43.610
that I would never spare you.

00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:45.210
If you want to kill him, kill me first.

00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:46.010
Cangcang.

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:51.340
You are my empress.

00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:53.210
Why would I kill you?

00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:14.940
Cangcang.

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:20.090
You sought me out today

00:41:20.590 --> 00:41:22.420
to urge me to send troops to Jiangzhou

00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:24.420
and save your brother, Ling Jueding.

00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:25.610
Yet now

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.900
you risk your life to protect Luo Xianxue.

00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:29.900
My dear,

00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:32.090
you certainly care for many people.

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:34.740
I am the only one you never hold in your heart.

00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:36.420
I once held you in mine.

00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:37.980
How did you treat me then?

00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:46.570
We truly cannot go back?

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:48.170
From the very beginning,

00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:49.490
there was only deceit between us.

00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:56.340
In that case,

00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:58.690
if you kill Luo Xianxue with your own hand,

00:41:59.230 --> 00:42:01.490
I may consider sending aid to Jiangzhou.

00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:04.130
You're mad.

00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:06.210
If you will not strike,

00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:07.690
I can do it for you.

00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:38.610
Do you mean to save Luo Xianxue,

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:41.300
or your brother, Ling Jueding?

00:42:41.550 --> 00:42:42.340
Xiao Huan!

00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:44.170
You are a sovereign.

00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:45.780
How can you trifle with lives?

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:48.460
Yet you force me to send troops without heed.

00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:49.130
Is that not also

00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:50.130
treating other lives

00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:51.130
as trifles?

00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:52.300
Jiangzhou and Xuzhou

00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:53.860
are both part of my realm.

00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:56.010
