00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.680
This part of the forest
is veiled by unseen powers.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.840
That's why Khun's performing
the unveiling ritual

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.040
to lead us to the missing.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.200
What's wrong?

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.320
I'm not sure,

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.400
but I have a bad feeling

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.040
something might go wrong.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:11.360
Help me!

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.640
Help...

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.440
Professor!

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.419
The lightning born from the power
of the Shiva lingam and the Yoni stone led me here

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.040
to seek what has been lost.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.920
That's...

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.600
a copy of the Vedic scriptures...

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.560
you discovered years ago.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.000
(Casting a spell)

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.960
I now call upon Brahmin Kalakal
to reclaim his body.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:14.280
(Casting a spell)

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.160
Aunt Kate,

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.800
there's something you need to know.

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.120
What is it?

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.560
It's Siwat...

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.160
Professor!

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.040
That's...

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.560
what I was gonna tell you.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.765
Siwat possesses powers
like Thara and Khunkhao do.

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:46.640
I'm sorry.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.520
I really can't control it.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.891
Are you sure that everything you told me,

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.080
about the four Brahmins

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.080
and the powers you three possess,

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:18.840
is connected to Tambralinga?

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:20.960
All that we've witnessed

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.360
leaves no room for doubt.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.680
It's all real.

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:27.760
The moment our noses bled,

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.840
it felt exactly like
the lightning that freed Kalakal.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.561
He's been freed again, hasn't he?

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.200
We need to figure out
how to deal with him.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.800
If he manages to possess...

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:40.920
any of us,

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.200
the rest will be in danger.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.240
All of our past happened in Tambralinga.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.888
Once we locate it,

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:50.960
we'll know how to deal with him.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:53.720
Wait,

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:55.000
are you...

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.160
trying to find that city?

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.080
I think we need to do it.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:01.924
You can't.

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:03.840
If that city gets mentioned again,

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.160
treasure hunters
will come swarming into the forest.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:07.700
If that's your concern,

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:08.960
we promise we...

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.020
I'm worried that...

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.520
I'll lose my family again,
like I lost Singkhon.

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:19.800
All of us...

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:21.920
will be targeted.

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:24.400
These treasure hunters will stop at nothing

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.960
to take the Shiva lingam and Yoni stone,

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.770
and everyone here will be at risk.

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:32.380
What if we go in quietly?

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:37.680
You know, just to find out
why the three of us had to meet again.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.680
You've forgotten, haven't you,

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.840
that Michael had to die

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:44.440
because of that city?

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.360
Mom!

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.060
It took us ten long years

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:49.520
to come to terms with Singkhon's death.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.800
Have you forgotten the agony we felt, Khun?

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.960
I want you to start fresh

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:02.720
and leave the past behind.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.560
If we keep bringing up that city,

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:07.520
how could Khun and Siwat

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.720
ever forget about Singkhon and Michael?

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.520
But...

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:21.200
if you know full well that what you're after

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.640
will ruin everyone here,

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.920
and you still refuse to stop,

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:29.720
then I can't stop you.

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:33.000
But if we're to suffer losses once again,

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.200
be prepared for the consequences.

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:20.240
Who are you?

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:22.600
Why are you spying on my family?!

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.800
Nearly 20 years have passed,

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.280
and the lone huntress of Nakhon Si Thammarat

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.730
has become nothing more than a legend.

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:37.760
Aisoon!

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:39.960
What do you want?

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:42.720
Do you think Khunkhao will ever know

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.200
who was responsible

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:46.960
for his dad's death?

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.240
Shut up!

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:51.880
You'll need to beg me to keep quiet forever,

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:53.720
like you always have.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.597
Otherwise,

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.640
Khunkhao will hate you for life.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.600
You already took Singkhon's life,

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.000
what more do you want?!

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.080
Bring me Siwat,

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:09.040
the Shiva lingam, and the Yoni Stone,

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.880
and I'll take this secret

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.400
to my grave.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:35.840
Thara!

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:39.440
What?

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:43.600
Well,

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.160
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.400
If you're talking about the past,

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.520
it doesn't matter.

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.640
But I killed you with my own hands.

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.840
You didn't kill me.

00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:58.920
Kalakal did.

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:07.000
Don't worry about it.

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:11.400
The more I see the past,

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.480
the more I fear...

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.945
that I might end up hurting you.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.960
The past may have returned

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.400
so that we can deal with Kalakal.

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:26.600
Uncle Singkhon once said that

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.560
our deaths would mark the end of everything.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.680
So today, I'll begin anew.

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:38.240
I won't let the past
steal away the person I love,

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:40.920
or you, again.

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:46.260
I'm heading to bed now.

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.360
You should get some rest, too.

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:18.809
I thought Thara would walk you here.

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.880
You've been through a lot today.

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:32.480
Go get some rest.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:34.327
Don't worry.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:37.840
Hang on.

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:46.800
Will you forgive my father?

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:57.920
I know it's not an easy thing to do...

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.160
but it's possible, isn't it?

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:57.360
Give it back to me.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:01.360
Khunkhao!

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:02.360
Hey!

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:04.280
What happened?

00:17:04.943 --> 00:17:05.750
Khunkhao?

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:06.840
Khunkhao...

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:09.280
- Dad...
- Yeah?

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:11.400
My necklace...

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000

Aisoon.

00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:24.800
Kate.

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:26.640
Take Khunkhao to the hospital.

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:28.844
Singkhon,

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:29.800
where are you going?

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:31.720
I'll go get the necklace back.

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:40.080
Watch out!

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:51.440
Singkhon!!

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:54.320
Dad!

00:17:58.843 --> 00:18:00.080
Dad...

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.160
Dad!

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:32.560
Khunkhao.

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:36.520
I dreamed of my dad.

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.120
It was just a dream.

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:53.280
If I had protected the Shiva lingam necklace,

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:57.260
my dad wouldn't have had to die.

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.760
It's my fault...

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:05.840
that he died.

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.720
I want to know what exactly happened.

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:35.720
There's someone who knows that very well.

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:37.120
Come closer and you'll die.

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:39.840
Aunt Kate!

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:40.720
Kill him.

00:19:41.708 --> 00:19:46.068
♫No matter how long it takes♫

00:19:46.108 --> 00:19:48.708
♫I'll still choose to love you♫

00:20:09.348 --> 00:20:10.348
Singkhon...

00:20:15.008 --> 00:20:16.188
I'm sorry.

00:20:19.788 --> 00:20:22.308
I really didn't know
what to do at the time.

00:20:43.765 --> 00:20:44.698
Are you crying?

00:20:48.508 --> 00:20:49.508
Is everything okay?

00:20:53.308 --> 00:20:54.148
I...

00:20:55.838 --> 00:20:57.308
just miss Singkhon.

00:21:06.648 --> 00:21:08.268
I also dreamed of him last night.

00:21:18.428 --> 00:21:19.748
Do you remember...

00:21:20.908 --> 00:21:22.388
how much Singkhon

00:21:22.828 --> 00:21:24.708
cherished Khao Luang forest

00:21:24.908 --> 00:21:26.988
and Tambralinga?

00:21:28.408 --> 00:21:29.408
I do.

00:21:31.368 --> 00:21:33.148
He never wanted anyone to invade

00:21:33.388 --> 00:21:34.448
or ruin it.

00:21:35.228 --> 00:21:36.268
If you know that...

00:21:36.308 --> 00:21:38.508
But Tambralinga means a lot to me,

00:21:38.548 --> 00:21:39.748
Thara...

00:21:42.148 --> 00:21:43.428
and Siwat as well.

00:21:49.628 --> 00:21:51.148
No matter what happens,

00:21:52.908 --> 00:21:54.828
I'll face the consequences.

00:21:58.228 --> 00:21:59.608
Please don't stop us.

00:22:38.808 --> 00:22:39.708
Aunt Kate,

00:22:41.968 --> 00:22:43.908
may I speak with you?

00:22:45.808 --> 00:22:46.668
Have a seat.

00:23:02.428 --> 00:23:03.268
Thank you.

00:23:09.908 --> 00:23:10.908
I love this place.

00:23:13.388 --> 00:23:15.908
I wanna stay here
with Khunkhao, Thara, and you.

00:23:17.488 --> 00:23:20.708
I know no one can ever forget
the pain of losing their parents.

00:23:27.788 --> 00:23:28.988
I just can't do anything.

00:23:31.728 --> 00:23:33.245
Unable to change the past...

00:23:36.908 --> 00:23:38.248
And unable to move forward.

00:23:42.828 --> 00:23:44.748
Why did my father hurt Uncle Singkhon?

00:23:47.028 --> 00:23:49.348
I want to know what exactly happened.

00:23:54.388 --> 00:23:56.388
There's someone who knows that very well.

00:24:35.548 --> 00:24:36.548
I'm here.

00:24:39.628 --> 00:24:41.628
I'm not getting out until I see you.

00:24:42.668 --> 00:24:43.668
I'm right here.

00:24:50.828 --> 00:24:51.668
Aisoon?

00:24:55.068 --> 00:24:55.988
I'm sorry.

00:24:57.348 --> 00:25:00.148
He wouldn't show himself
if I didn't bring you with me.

00:25:01.348 --> 00:25:02.788
As soon as I get out of the car,

00:25:03.708 --> 00:25:05.188
drive away immediately.

00:25:05.228 --> 00:25:06.388
But what about you?

00:25:06.748 --> 00:25:08.148
Just go. Don't worry about me.

00:25:37.608 --> 00:25:39.028
Where are the Shiva lingam
and the Yoni stone?

00:25:57.308 --> 00:25:58.148
Aunt Kate!

00:26:02.788 --> 00:26:03.588
Aunt Kate!

00:26:04.148 --> 00:26:04.988
Siwat...

00:26:05.748 --> 00:26:06.748
Come closer and you'll die.

00:26:11.908 --> 00:26:12.628
Aunt Kate...

00:26:12.708 --> 00:26:13.508
Aunt Kate!

00:26:19.508 --> 00:26:20.628
Have you seen my mom?

00:26:21.308 --> 00:26:22.108
No, bro.

00:26:24.828 --> 00:26:26.466
Mind, have you seen my mom?

00:26:27.908 --> 00:26:28.668
No.

00:26:29.268 --> 00:26:30.428
Where could she be?

00:26:30.988 --> 00:26:31.908
Her phone's off.

00:26:31.948 --> 00:26:32.748
Lookwaii,

00:26:32.948 --> 00:26:33.868
have you seen Siwat?

00:26:34.348 --> 00:26:35.988
He's not home and won't pick up my calls.

00:26:36.868 --> 00:26:38.068
- No.
- Wait.

00:26:38.868 --> 00:26:42.428
Are you not gonna tell us
about the powers Siwat possesses?

00:26:53.428 --> 00:26:54.228
Khun,

00:26:54.268 --> 00:26:56.108
someone just sent a picture to our page.

00:26:59.388 --> 00:27:00.148
Hey...

00:27:03.308 --> 00:27:04.428
That's Aisoon,

00:27:04.728 --> 00:27:05.628
one of Michael's people.

00:27:06.148 --> 00:27:07.668
With my mom and Siwat.

00:27:10.048 --> 00:27:11.117
What's going on?

00:27:17.588 --> 00:27:19.788
How much longer
will you keep hunting me down?

00:27:20.428 --> 00:27:22.108
Until the day you die.

00:27:29.188 --> 00:27:29.988
Maria?

00:27:31.648 --> 00:27:32.810
Get rid of him.

00:27:55.988 --> 00:27:57.050
Get her.

00:27:58.068 --> 00:27:58.831
No...

00:27:59.708 --> 00:28:00.428
No!

00:28:00.788 --> 00:28:01.668
Leave me alone!

00:28:04.708 --> 00:28:05.628
Let go of me!

00:28:07.148 --> 00:28:08.028
Kill him.

00:28:09.748 --> 00:28:11.628
But we haven't obtained the stones yet.

00:28:12.028 --> 00:28:13.148
We have her.

00:28:13.388 --> 00:28:14.668
We'll keep her as our bargaining chip.

00:28:15.528 --> 00:28:16.995
Siwat has his powers.

00:28:17.388 --> 00:28:18.788
Do you wanna be burned alive?

00:28:24.368 --> 00:28:26.308
I'll take you to someone...

00:28:26.348 --> 00:28:29.388
who can tell you the truth
about Singkhon's death.

00:28:30.788 --> 00:28:33.748
But for your safety,
don't wear your Yoni stone necklace.

00:28:54.988 --> 00:28:55.868
Dean?!

00:28:56.588 --> 00:28:57.788
No, Dad...

00:28:57.948 --> 00:28:58.788
Kill him!

00:29:02.148 --> 00:29:02.948
Dean...

00:29:03.508 --> 00:29:04.228
Do it!

00:29:04.388 --> 00:29:05.668
I told you to kill him!

00:29:09.818 --> 00:29:11.264
Give it to me.

00:29:12.508 --> 00:29:13.428
Do it!

00:29:13.548 --> 00:29:14.468
Shoot me!

00:29:14.708 --> 00:29:15.508
Sure!

00:29:15.781 --> 00:29:17.061
I'm fine with that!

00:29:17.428 --> 00:29:19.548
You asked for it,
so I'll make sure you get it.

00:29:19.588 --> 00:29:20.308
Dean...

00:29:27.108 --> 00:29:27.828
Hey!

00:29:42.348 --> 00:29:43.628
How did you get here?

00:29:43.988 --> 00:29:44.988
Thanks, Dean.

00:29:52.268 --> 00:29:53.134
Aisoon,

00:29:53.588 --> 00:29:56.228
what happened to my dad 19 years ago?

00:29:56.988 --> 00:29:57.988
What are you talking about?

00:29:58.848 --> 00:29:59.848
I have no idea.

00:30:00.288 --> 00:30:01.388
You drugged me

00:30:02.228 --> 00:30:04.428
to steal the necklace for Michael,
didn't you?

00:30:05.548 --> 00:30:07.068
I didn't drug anyone.

00:30:08.148 --> 00:30:09.548
The one who did it...

00:30:12.148 --> 00:30:13.068
was her.

00:30:18.148 --> 00:30:19.028
Liar!

00:30:19.948 --> 00:30:21.748
My mom would never drug Khun.

00:30:22.268 --> 00:30:23.188
You're lying!

00:30:23.748 --> 00:30:25.668
Your mom drugged Khunkhao

00:30:26.688 --> 00:30:28.108
so I could get the Shiva lingam.

00:30:29.748 --> 00:30:31.148
And Singkhon had to die...

00:30:31.628 --> 00:30:32.828
because...

00:30:33.568 --> 00:30:35.228
he was betrayed by his own sister.

00:30:35.988 --> 00:30:36.828
That's not true.

00:30:37.308 --> 00:30:38.628
Mom, tell us he's lying!

00:30:39.108 --> 00:30:41.148
You didn't betray Uncle Singkhon,
did you?

00:30:52.748 --> 00:30:53.867
I'm sorry.

00:31:09.268 --> 00:31:10.068
Dad!

00:31:10.388 --> 00:31:11.388
They're running away!

00:31:55.048 --> 00:31:57.108
If you'd been honest with my dad,

00:31:57.308 --> 00:31:58.545
he wouldn't have had to die.

00:31:58.748 --> 00:32:00.188
I'm really sorry, Khunkhao.

00:32:03.468 --> 00:32:04.308
Khun...

00:32:04.856 --> 00:32:09.216
♫No matter how long it takes♫

00:32:09.256 --> 00:32:11.856
♫I'll still choose to love you♫

00:32:18.016 --> 00:32:19.416
I know you had your reasons.

00:32:20.476 --> 00:32:21.816
Tell me the truth.

00:32:22.496 --> 00:32:24.016
Tell everyone

00:32:25.056 --> 00:32:27.136
what really happened.

00:32:29.936 --> 00:32:31.536
Searching for Tambralinga...

00:32:33.856 --> 00:32:36.157
has always been Singkhon's dream.

00:32:39.256 --> 00:32:41.197
A check for five million baht will be yours...

00:32:41.206 --> 00:32:41.976
[Singkhon Sriwichit]

00:32:41.986 --> 00:32:43.856
if you agree to work with me.

00:32:46.896 --> 00:32:48.216
We needed the money

00:32:48.256 --> 00:32:50.696
for Thara's heart surgery,

00:32:51.456 --> 00:32:52.859
so he said yes.

00:32:53.896 --> 00:32:54.790
Fine.

00:32:55.081 --> 00:32:56.016
I'll do it.

00:32:57.576 --> 00:32:59.096
But I have one condition.

00:33:00.256 --> 00:33:01.936
Once we discover the ruins of Tambralinga,

00:33:02.396 --> 00:33:04.336
we must absolutely keep the location secret

00:33:04.856 --> 00:33:07.056
until I decide the time's right.

00:33:07.876 --> 00:33:09.856
I won't allow Khao Luang forest
to be destroyed,

00:33:10.936 --> 00:33:12.776
not by those treasure hunters.

00:33:13.596 --> 00:33:14.596
Deal.

00:33:14.736 --> 00:33:18.496
Finding Tambralinga
has always been my dream, too.

00:33:19.796 --> 00:33:22.136
I don't want the forest
to be destroyed, either.

00:33:43.216 --> 00:33:46.256
After years of searching Khao Luang forest,

00:33:46.842 --> 00:33:48.336
Aisoon discovered something.

00:33:48.376 --> 00:33:51.616
He realized that the Yoni stone
Michael obtained when he adopted Siwat,

00:33:51.896 --> 00:33:53.896
and Khunkhao's Shiva lingam,

00:33:54.336 --> 00:33:56.056
were connected to Tambralinga.

00:33:56.916 --> 00:33:58.736
We set out immediately.

00:34:34.096 --> 00:34:35.016
I'm okay.

00:34:35.656 --> 00:34:36.656
Don't worry.

00:35:06.696 --> 00:35:07.816
Please take some medicine.

00:35:28.136 --> 00:35:29.136
Thanks.

00:35:42.416 --> 00:35:43.416
How's he doing?

00:35:46.916 --> 00:35:47.916
Not good.

00:35:50.096 --> 00:35:51.336
We can only ease the pain.

00:35:54.576 --> 00:35:55.976
But not long after entering the forest,

00:35:56.396 --> 00:35:58.176
Michael contracted cerebral malaria

00:35:58.216 --> 00:35:59.776
and had to return to the UK for treatment.

00:35:59.816 --> 00:36:01.136
He never came back.

00:36:02.256 --> 00:36:05.936
But Aisoon did,
a day before Thara's surgery.

00:36:13.256 --> 00:36:14.056
Thara!

00:36:14.256 --> 00:36:14.936
Mom!

00:36:14.976 --> 00:36:15.816
Mom!

00:36:16.896 --> 00:36:17.875
Are you sure?

00:36:21.776 --> 00:36:22.896
If you fight me,

00:36:23.696 --> 00:36:24.536
your son dies.

00:36:25.496 --> 00:36:26.376
Let me go!

00:36:27.656 --> 00:36:28.656
Mom!

00:36:33.256 --> 00:36:34.096
Mom...

00:36:35.496 --> 00:36:37.176
Don't you ever hurt Thara!

00:36:43.056 --> 00:36:43.936
Here, Khun.

00:36:44.536 --> 00:36:45.656
Have some hot cocoa.

00:36:46.256 --> 00:36:47.536
Thank you, Aunt Kate.

00:36:52.256 --> 00:36:55.416
He forced me to drug Khunkhao

00:36:55.736 --> 00:36:57.816
so he could steal the Shiva lingam.

00:37:07.656 --> 00:37:08.536
Khun...

00:37:11.216 --> 00:37:12.256
How do you feel, Khun?

00:37:16.496 --> 00:37:18.456
You're just very sleepy, aren't you?

00:37:19.416 --> 00:37:20.316
Yes.

00:37:24.176 --> 00:37:25.040
Khun,

00:37:25.576 --> 00:37:26.976
just take a nap right here.

00:37:27.256 --> 00:37:29.896
I'll check if Singkhon's ready.

00:37:59.976 --> 00:38:00.816
No!

00:38:01.256 --> 00:38:02.016
No...

00:38:03.176 --> 00:38:04.056
No!

00:38:04.756 --> 00:38:05.616
No...

00:38:08.456 --> 00:38:09.296
No!

00:38:09.496 --> 00:38:11.136
Give me back my necklace.

00:38:16.636 --> 00:38:18.696
Once Aisoon had the necklace,

00:38:18.736 --> 00:38:20.616
he wouldn't let Thara go.

00:38:21.436 --> 00:38:22.616
In the end,

00:38:22.656 --> 00:38:24.656
I had to tell Singkhon the truth.

00:38:25.576 --> 00:38:28.136
We hunted him down in Khao Luang forest

00:38:28.176 --> 00:38:29.856
to save Thara.

00:38:31.856 --> 00:38:32.976
Where's Thara?!

00:38:33.416 --> 00:38:34.856
Answer me!

00:38:39.376 --> 00:38:40.096
Watch out!

00:38:42.816 --> 00:38:43.816
Singkhon...

00:38:46.936 --> 00:38:47.766
Watch out!

00:38:58.296 --> 00:38:59.256
Singkhon!

00:39:04.536 --> 00:39:05.976
Singkhon!!

00:39:06.456 --> 00:39:08.036
Singkhon!!

00:39:12.336 --> 00:39:13.576
Singkhon...

00:39:18.496 --> 00:39:19.256
Mom!

00:39:19.616 --> 00:39:20.416
Thara?!

00:39:33.016 --> 00:39:34.936
After Singkhon died,

00:39:38.816 --> 00:39:40.337
when I found Thara...

00:39:42.056 --> 00:39:43.816
he was nearly dead too.

00:39:46.736 --> 00:39:47.656
But...

00:39:48.309 --> 00:39:52.256
why didn't my father know that
Aisoon took Uncle Singkhon's life?

00:39:53.296 --> 00:39:54.936
I was ashamed,

00:39:55.176 --> 00:39:57.696
so I didn't let anyone know.

00:39:58.736 --> 00:40:01.936
I never thought Aisoon
would dare work for Michael again.

00:40:06.416 --> 00:40:07.976
Before Michael passed away,

00:40:09.276 --> 00:40:12.256
he asked me
to take him to look for the city again.

00:40:14.256 --> 00:40:16.336
He wanted to help you, Siwat.

00:40:18.256 --> 00:40:20.555
If you'd been honest with my dad,

00:40:22.316 --> 00:40:23.576
he wouldn't have had to die.

00:40:24.996 --> 00:40:26.136
I was scared.

00:40:27.636 --> 00:40:29.296
Too afraid to risk it.

00:40:34.816 --> 00:40:36.656
I'm really sorry, Khunkhao.

00:40:42.966 --> 00:40:44.063
Khun...

00:41:05.176 --> 00:41:06.176
Professor!

00:41:06.496 --> 00:41:09.056
Fetch me the Shiva lingam and the Yoni stone!

00:41:12.124 --> 00:41:16.644
♫No matter how long it takes♫

00:41:16.684 --> 00:41:19.284
♫I'll still choose to love you♫

00:41:27.004 --> 00:41:28.644
You guys suck.

00:41:30.524 --> 00:41:31.764
You too.

00:41:31.924 --> 00:41:33.524
Got the nerve to crawl back, huh?

00:41:39.624 --> 00:41:40.884
Thanks to your son,

00:41:41.544 --> 00:41:43.044
everything's f*cked up.

00:41:43.244 --> 00:41:44.304
No Shiva lingam.

00:41:44.344 --> 00:41:45.444
Nothing at all.

00:41:47.044 --> 00:41:48.444
There's still a chance.

00:41:49.604 --> 00:41:51.204
After all the times you've messed up,

00:41:51.244 --> 00:41:52.524
you've got countless chances, huh?

00:41:52.724 --> 00:41:54.604
Come on. Without me,

00:41:55.444 --> 00:41:57.684
you'll never get the Heart of the Vedas,

00:41:58.084 --> 00:42:00.124
that priceless gem
that could make you crazy rich.

00:42:01.044 --> 00:42:01.804
And?

00:42:01.844 --> 00:42:03.084
I haven't even gotten it yet.

00:42:03.164 --> 00:42:04.164
Who's to blame?

00:42:04.704 --> 00:42:05.404
Well,

00:42:05.884 --> 00:42:06.804
then kill me.

00:42:08.804 --> 00:42:09.684
Sure.

00:42:09.924 --> 00:42:10.924
As you wish.

00:42:11.044 --> 00:42:11.844
Yeah.

00:42:12.384 --> 00:42:13.324
Go ahead and kill me,

00:42:13.844 --> 00:42:16.764
then go back to being
an invisible MILF model

00:42:17.304 --> 00:42:19.161
with no Michael's money backing you up.

00:42:21.284 --> 00:42:22.284
Kill me.

00:42:23.324 --> 00:42:24.764
Don't you dare try me.

00:42:28.364 --> 00:42:29.364
Maybe...

00:42:29.644 --> 00:42:31.958
you have to choose between killing me

00:42:32.564 --> 00:42:33.844
or walking forward with me.

00:42:37.164 --> 00:42:38.604
So, what's your plan?

00:42:41.684 --> 00:42:43.404
They've got both stones,

00:42:44.604 --> 00:42:46.804
and Siwat will surely go after the city.

00:42:46.844 --> 00:42:48.164
We just need to ambush them.

00:42:50.324 --> 00:42:52.724
After all those years following Michael,

00:42:52.764 --> 00:42:55.124
you still haven't laid eyes on the ruins.

00:42:55.277 --> 00:42:56.437
But someone has,

00:42:56.884 --> 00:42:57.524
you know?

00:42:57.564 --> 00:42:58.844
And he knows where it is.

00:43:04.644 --> 00:43:06.964
That Professor Thakoon or something?

00:43:10.004 --> 00:43:12.964
He's as obsessed with Tambralinga as Michael.

00:43:13.804 --> 00:43:16.324
He even visited the city ruins in the forest
with Singkhon

00:43:16.444 --> 00:43:18.764
and tried to document it in a book,

00:43:19.264 --> 00:43:22.044
insisting to the scholars
that the city was real.

00:43:22.404 --> 00:43:23.724
But no one believed him.

00:43:24.291 --> 00:43:27.171
Then he became known as a mad scholar.

00:43:30.304 --> 00:43:33.764
Are you sure
he's gonna lead us to the city?

00:44:13.624 --> 00:44:14.484
Professor!

00:44:39.284 --> 00:44:40.604
Brahmin Kalakal...

00:44:42.724 --> 00:44:44.884
I've long awaited
the moment I could stand before you.

00:44:46.404 --> 00:44:48.284
What is it that you desire from me?

00:44:49.964 --> 00:44:52.924
I wish to serve you loyally, Brahmin Kalakal,

00:44:53.964 --> 00:44:56.324
the Earth Bender of Tambralinga.

00:44:57.764 --> 00:44:59.084
Whatever you ask,

00:45:00.184 --> 00:45:01.724
I will obey.

00:45:03.604 --> 00:45:06.284
Bring me Suriya and the others.

00:45:07.824 --> 00:45:10.244
You may now enter my body,

00:45:12.284 --> 00:45:13.924
and I shall handle it myself.

00:45:26.324 --> 00:45:27.204
This is crazy!

00:45:27.484 --> 00:45:28.364
My goodness!

00:45:29.044 --> 00:45:30.244
He's gone crazy!

00:45:31.844 --> 00:45:32.629
Khun...

00:45:36.284 --> 00:45:38.204
Khun must not know about this.

00:45:38.764 --> 00:45:39.684
Professor...

00:45:44.164 --> 00:45:45.164
Professor!

00:45:46.444 --> 00:45:47.324
Professor...

00:45:47.364 --> 00:45:49.964
Fetch me the Shiva lingam and the Yoni stone!

00:45:51.564 --> 00:45:52.204
Professor...

00:46:10.444 --> 00:46:11.604
Who the hell are you?

00:46:12.484 --> 00:46:14.940
If you want the Shiva lingam
and the Yoni stone,

00:46:15.324 --> 00:46:16.604
I can get them for you.

00:46:19.004 --> 00:46:20.444
We truly can.

00:46:21.084 --> 00:46:22.684
You're their enemies, aren't you?

00:46:23.604 --> 00:46:24.884
But in exchange,

00:46:25.724 --> 00:46:28.164
you must take us to Tambralinga with you.

00:46:30.724 --> 00:46:32.274
Show me...

00:46:34.004 --> 00:46:36.964
how you're gonna obtain both of the stones.

00:46:43.364 --> 00:46:44.564
I've got a plan.

00:46:59.444 --> 00:47:01.124
If they know we're the Benders,

00:47:01.164 --> 00:47:02.644
then what's their plan?

00:47:02.804 --> 00:47:03.964
We can't avoid it.

00:47:04.124 --> 00:47:05.644
Then we must face it.

00:47:05.685 --> 00:47:06.365
Hey!

00:47:07.164 --> 00:47:07.884
Wait...

00:47:12.124 --> 00:47:14.964
Everything must return to the beginning.

00:47:15.324 --> 00:47:16.404
The beginning?

00:47:16.604 --> 00:47:18.924
It's pathetic
seeing you all protecting each other.

00:47:18.964 --> 00:47:21.524
No matter how hard you try to lie to us,

00:47:21.724 --> 00:47:22.884
I won't buy it.

00:47:22.924 --> 00:47:24.924
Guess you'll have to see for yourselves.

00:47:25.164 --> 00:47:29.404
