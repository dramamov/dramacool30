00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:03.680
(Episode 107)

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:07.580
You're here, my princesses. Welcome.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.620
Right this way.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:20.190
Gosh.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.430
To think this day has finally come.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.660
The three of us are finally together.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.970
This just goes to show you
blood is thicker than water.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.300
- What is he even saying?
- Se Ri.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.170
Do you have any idea
what this is all about?

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.570
I was dragged to this dinner I hate
because of you.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.080
Aren't you adorable?

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:43.980
Excuse me.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.090
Please put my Se Ri's setting on the left.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:53.960
She's a lefty, just like me.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.830
And there's no seafood on the menu today,
is there?

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.170
You see, my Se Ri has a seafood allergy.
She got it from her mom.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.970
Hey, why do you keep saying "my Se Ri?"
It's giving me the creeps.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.440
And do you happen
to take family photos here?

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.480
That's more of a family-restaurant thing.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.650
I got a little carried away. My apologies.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.720
If you want a family photo,
wait until you marry Kyung Chae...

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.690
and have kids of your own.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.720
Se Ri.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.300
- How do you think other people see us?
- What do you think?

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.960
They probably think we're strangers
who aren't even related...

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.370
and don't suit each other.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:35.670
I think the opposite.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.070
I bet they think we're a family.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.540
This is so annoying.
If you keep this up, I'm going home.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.580
Mom, what's with him today?
Has he lost his mind?

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.650
What did you want to talk about?
You said Se Ri needed to hear this too.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:52.880
That was it.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.060
All I wanted to do today was
for the three of us to have a meal...

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.720
and feel like a family.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.330
This isn't a joke, and it's just annoying.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.000
How can a grown man act so childish
and make such a joke?

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.230
Mom, I'm leaving.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.970
Are you crazy? What's wrong with you?
How could you do this in front of her?

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.010
Se Ri!

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.220
Well, it's a shame to end
our first family dinner like this.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.420
But this is just the beginning.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.830
Until the day our family
truly takes over Mingang.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.210
Are you very upset?

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.710
What's his deal, anyway?
Some things just aren't funny.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.080
Why would he, you, and I be a family?

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.780
Why does he keep pushing the family thing?
It's so annoying!

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.220
Calm down and get some rest, okay?

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.890
When you're upset like this,
it makes me upset too.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.770
So cheer up for me, all right?

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.970
I'm only happy when my daughter is happy.

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.880
Quite the motherly act
for someone who doesn't mean it.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.390
Anyone watching would think
you actually gave birth to her.

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.590
I may not have given birth to her,

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.490
but that doesn't mean
my feelings aren't real.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.160
Isn't that even stranger?

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.360
How can you be sincere about a child
you didn't even give birth to?

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.860
Unless you have an ulterior motive,

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.230
- how is that possible?
- It is.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.600
There's more to family than blood ties.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.340
The bond you form by raising someone
is a real thing.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.480
Even if they're not your blood,
if you love and care for them,

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.940
then you're family.
Isn't that enough to become one?

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.180
How noble of you.

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.250
Now that the divorce papers are signed,
shouldn't you be on your way out?

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.890
How long are you going to keep
hanging around our house?

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.320
The divorce isn't finalized yet.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.860
Once it's final, I'll leave
even if you stop me. Don't worry.

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.600
And that finalization
is just around the corner.

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.400
Soon, it'll be goodbye forever to you.

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.550
What? What's wrong?

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.750
"What's wrong?"

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.090
Who do you think you are to drag Se Ri
into that shameful spectacle yesterday?

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.120
You've taken this joke way too far!

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.360
Who said I was joking?
I was serious yesterday.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.990
And I still am.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.660
In fact, I've never been more serious
in my entire life.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.870
Are you Se Ri's dad or something?
I'm not even her real mom,

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.440
and we're not family,
so why do you keep harping on about it?

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.180
Baek Sul Hee, we are family.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.780
Se Ri is the daughter you gave birth to.
And she's my flesh and blood.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.720
That's why our new family is going
to take over Mingang and have it all.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.120
And I'll help you make that happen.

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.320
Secretly, without anyone knowing.

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.090
Just try pulling a stunt
like that one more time.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
And what's this about you
ripping up the divorce papers?

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.960
It's exactly what it sounds like.
I destroyed them myself.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.130
If you don't believe me, check yourself.
See if anything's been filed.

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.710
I don't want Chairman Min Doo Sik
and Jung Lucia to get a divorce right now.

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:38.880
- What's in it for me?
- You've been strange since yesterday.

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.650
On the outside, you're Kim Sun Jae,
but inside, you feel like someone else.

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.980
What is going on with you?
What's your angle?

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.890
There is no angle.

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.020
Except for one thing.

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.990
It's that I want my bloodline...

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.930
to become the new owner of Mingang.
Let's just put it that way.

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.610
You're doing a good job
assisting the acting chairman.

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.710
You put your heart and soul
into the company.

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:14.980
You're a pretty decent guy,
I'll give you that.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.510
What's this all of a sudden?

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.680
I don't care anymore
if you're Moon Tae Kyung or not.

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.650
And about Chairman Min Doo Sik's
slush fund ledger that I have.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.660
I'm just trying to figure out
the most devastating time to release it.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.400
So you're going to expose it?

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:35.630
That way,
you'll become a financial criminal.

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:36.630
You won't get away with it.

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.800
That's for me to worry about.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:43.310
But the important thing is that
there's a whole new game in front of me.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.740
Last time, you said
you'd reached a turning point in life,

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.380
and now it's a whole new game?

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:51.650
Seriously, what's gotten into you lately?

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:56.490
We're not exactly on good terms,
but I'm worried you changed so suddenly.

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:58.060
You know what the old folks say.

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:01.390
When someone changes overnight,
it means their days are numbered.

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:04.330
Don't you worry about me.
You should be worried about yourself.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:09.300
I can look the other way
while you treat Lucia as your boss,

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:11.700
but don't you dare get any ideas
about being her man.

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:14.840
Because in the end, she will return...

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:16.740
to her first man.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.450
Kim Sun Jae really said that?

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:31.990
He's like a totally different person.
What in the world is going on?

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:34.760
He said he ripped up our divorce papers.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.830
I checked just in case, and it was true.

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:40.330
That's not the kind of man Kim Sun Jae is.
But why?

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.030
Why would he be helping us?

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:44.040
If anything,
he'd be trying to get in our way.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.100
Unbelievable.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:47.810
Oh, and also,

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:49.870
he said that in the end,

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.280
you would go back to your first man.

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:55.080
My first man?

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:00.820
Wait, so he's saying
I'm going to go back to him?

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:03.220
I don't know. Something's definitely off.

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.420
He wouldn't be acting this way
unless he had an ace up his sleeve.

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:10.060
Come to think of it,
he was acting weird yesterday too.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.600
He asked me and Se Ri
to have dinner with him.

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:15.200
Dinner?

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:18.770
Wait, with Se Ri too? Why?

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:22.570
He was going on about
how the three of us are a family.

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:24.080
A family?

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:27.250
It's time to get rid of Lucia,
don't you think?

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:31.080
Kick her out of the house and company,
and erase every trace of her.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.490
The divorce papers have been filed,
so it will all be taken care of.

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:38.560
As much as I hate Kim Sun Jae
becoming Se Ri's stepfather,

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:41.490
what I hate even more is
Se Ri not knowing anything...

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:44.230
and adoring Lucia
as if she were her real mother.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.970
Imagine the tragedy
of her thinking Lucia is her mother.

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:51.740
Do you have another plan, then?

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:55.340
I'll give you my entire stake
and everything I've scraped together.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:57.310
I'll hand it all over to you.

00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:59.840
So call a shareholders' meeting
and oust her for good.

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:03.980
Come to think of it, you're a real softie,

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:06.380
seeing how you're living
in the same house as Lucia.

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:08.450
I couldn't do that for a single day.

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:12.820
How can you stand it, knowing full well
what she thinks of our Se Ri?

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:17.630
She'll stop at nothing to play
the perfect stepmother to win Se Ri over.

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:20.770
What will you do when Se Ri is ready...

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:25.070
to jump off a cliff if Lucia tells her to
after being gaslighted?

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.610
So, should I call a shareholders' meeting
and formally have her dismissed?

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.910
Do it.
And call a board meeting if you have to.

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:36.010
If anyone gives you trouble,
tell them Stella Jang won't let it slide.

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:39.250
They know who holds the leverage
over their weaknesses.

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:47.330
Who did you meet with last night?

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:49.660
Just someone.

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:51.460
That woman... Oh, right.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.570
I saw you come in with your stepmother.

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:59.570
- I guess you met them together.
- She insisted.

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:04.080
Who did you meet
that required her to be there?

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:09.350
You don't need to know.
You're being so nosy.

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:15.090
By the way, Se Ri,
when I really look at you,

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:17.790
you look so much like your stepmother.
Do you know that?

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:20.690
I don't just mean you have a similar vibe.

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:23.090
Visually, you're like two peas in a pod...

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.460
Two peas in a pod? Don't be ridiculous!

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.570
Your eyesight must be terrible.

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:29.230
You should get yourself a pair of glasses.

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.770
Oh, my. Why are you so worked up?

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:34.210
I'm just calling it like I see it.

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:36.540
Really? Then tell me exactly
what looks so similar!

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:41.080
Their eyes, nose, and mouth.
They're identical in every way.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.380
Anyone would think they were
a real mother and daughter.

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:45.420
Mother and daughter? Who?

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:47.650
You say that again and see what happens!

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.250
I won't just stand by and take it!

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:53.360
Goodness. Are you trying to pick a fight
with me right now?

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:56.490
I'm only reacting this way
because you're spouting nonsense!

00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:00.330
- How is that nonsense?
- Where do they look alike?

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:04.600
(Mingang Distribution)

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:06.400
What did you call me for?

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.310
I'm swamped with work right now.

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:11.010
The office can't run without me.

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:12.510
Why haven't you submitted...

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:13.710
Online Business Team's
new business proposal?

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:15.550
I heard you were in charge of it.

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:18.650
Oh, that? I'm working on it now.

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:22.590
I can't just throw it together.
I'm putting my all into it,

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:24.520
so it's taking a bit of time.

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:26.990
If you're too excited
about the director promotion...

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:28.560
to focus on your work...

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:31.560
Hey, no way! Who said that?
I'm not like that at all.

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:34.630
I told you to wait quietly, didn't I?

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:38.770
If you keep slacking off
and make it obvious to everyone,

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.740
I might reconsider.

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:43.940
Even without your shares,
it won't affect the overall outcome.

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.710
Besides, I have Madam Jang.

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:49.850
Hey, what's gotten into you?
Did I do something to upset you?

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:52.380
If I did, I'm sorry. I'll do better.

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:54.650
I'll go finish the proposal right now.

00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:57.690
I'll submit it by the end of the day,
so just hang on. All right?

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:10.470
What? You came to get another whiff
of the director's office?

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:14.210
I'm not redecorating,
so don't worry and get out.

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:18.210
No, that's not it. It's just that
Kyung Chae seems a little different.

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:19.940
Isn't it natural for her to change?

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.110
She has Stella Jang
firmly in her corner now.

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:26.180
Why on earth did Madam Jang
change her tune like that?

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:29.050
Either way, it works out for you,
doesn't it?

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.320
If Kyung Chae
promised you the director position,

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:32.720
you've already won.

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:36.160
- I'm the one with the problem.
- Hey, that's not true.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:37.800
Kyung Chae is saying...

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:40.130
she doesn't necessarily need my shares.

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:42.730
Seriously, what am I supposed
to make of that?

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:46.770
Stop trying to play her game
and just go do your job.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.940
Besides, what am I supposed to do
when you bring me problems like this?

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:55.610
Should I give advice to you
when you're after my job?

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:56.910
Or should I console you?

00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:58.920
Try using your head for once.

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:01.390
Really? Is that how it works?

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:04.920
My goodness.

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:07.120
Why are all these stock prices
in the gutter?

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.560
At this rate, I'm worried I'm just doing
all the work for someone else's gain.

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:11.160
What is it again? Something wrong?

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:14.500
We only need to worry about
the Mingang Distribution stock price.

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:17.600
I know, but I shouldn't be
the only one to prosper.

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:20.500
We all have to prosper together.
That's how our country stays strong.

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:23.340
Look at you. You're acting suspicious.

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:25.640
You didn't get into trouble again,
did you?

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:30.110
Remember how Ji Seop and Ja Kyung told us
to hold on tight to our Mingang stake?

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:32.150
My beautiful wife, of course.

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:34.220
You think I sold it off?

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:37.390
Ji Seop is going to need it,
even if not right away.

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:41.460
- Keep it safe and hand it over to him.
- That's the plan. Don't you worry.

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:45.500
Do you really think I'd sell it
to invest in another stock?

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:49.300
You're obsessed with money,
but you wouldn't do that.

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:52.940
Depending on who gets those shares,
the owner of the company could change.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.070
We have to support Ji Seop,
no matter what.

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:57.940
Wait. Don't tell me...

00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:02.250
- you already gave it to someone.
- I said no!

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:03.750
Why are you yelling at me?

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:07.380
All that yelling made me hungry.
Go make me some instant noodles.

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:10.050
Instant noodles? Just eat this.

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.660
We haven't had instant noodles in so long.
Think about how it feels.

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:16.330
After 50 years, it must feel let down.
You have to be loyal, right?

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:19.000
Green onions, an egg, and tons of pepper.
You know how I like it.

00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:22.500
Good grief.
Is your stomach a bottomless pit?

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:34.450
- Stella. This is Oh Pan Sool.
- Pan Sool? What's this about?

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:36.610
I'm just calling to ask this.

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:39.250
Did you sell the Mingang stake I gave you?

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:40.580
Yes, of course.

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:44.360
Oh, it must be because
I haven't transferred the funds yet.

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:47.630
I actually bought your stake myself.

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:49.960
I'll add a premium and send you the money.

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:52.200
Wait, why would you buy it, Stella?

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:56.670
Anyway, my wife won't stop nagging me,

00:14:56.730 --> 00:15:00.870
so would it be a problem for you
if I were to buy it back?

00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:04.580
My goodness!
Are you a man who goes back on his word?

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:08.250
That won't do.
Changing your tune because of your wife...

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:10.680
is truly disappointing.

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:13.650
No, of course not. I can't let you down.

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:16.590
I just spoke out of turn.
Please, just forget I said anything.

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:20.590
Well, then, I will take my leave.

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.930
Seriously, that old fool.

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:29.900
Why would he want the Mingang stake back
now of all times?

00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:33.040
And a shareholders' meeting
will be called soon.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.410
Are you seriously
holding a shareholders' meeting...

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:36.840
to oust our Lucia?

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:39.910
When are you going to stop
calling her that?

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:41.650
Tae Joo.

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:44.820
From now on, get close to Kyung Chae,
not Lucia.

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:47.220
She's Ho Se's woman,
which makes her your sister-in-law.

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:51.160
- It's just been hard for me.
- Then you need to try.

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:54.190
Min Kyung Chae is on our side now,
not Lucia.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:55.390
How many times do I have to tell you?

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:06.600
If Madam Jang is going to pass
Mingang down to her granddaughter, Se Ri,

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:10.470
that means she might eliminate Lucia
right away.

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:14.280
No, wait.
She wouldn't even have to go after Lucia.

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:18.880
She knows I'm here,
so she could get rid of me at any moment.

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:21.120
No way.

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:23.090
Absolutely not.

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:25.060
I won't go down like this!

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:32.710
(Mingang Distribution)

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:35.750
(Mingang Distribution)

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:45.120
You look like you're on your way
to a funeral.

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:47.160
I don't know what your deal is,

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:49.960
but that outfit isn't right
for the office, is it?

00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:57.570
And you got chrysanthemums too.

00:19:58.670 --> 00:19:59.800
Did someone die?

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:02.510
Will you please just shut your mouth?

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:06.710
I don't want to exchange a word with you,
especially today.

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:09.980
What could have possibly upset you
this time?

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:12.650
On a day like today,
breathing the same air as you...

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:13.880
makes me sick,

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:16.220
so just act like you don't know me.

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:22.190
(Mingang Distribution)

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:24.760
Doors closing.

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:26.930
(Mingang Distribution)

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:33.740
Fine. Be as smug as you want.

00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:36.840
There aren't many days left
for that, anyway.

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:54.760
Once everyone who deserves it
has been punished,

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:56.660
let's go together...

00:20:57.490 --> 00:20:58.800
to Mi So's columbarium.

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:03.500
Together?

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:05.640
Together.

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:09.070
Because we'll be on the same side
until the very end.

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:12.140
In that case,

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:15.110
let's go to your parents' columbarium too.

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:18.520
Sure, let's do that.

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:22.420
My parents would be so happy
to hear that in the skies.

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:25.760
Lucia.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:30.630
The fact that you're Mi So's mom,
it's still...

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:33.200
No, that's something
that will never change.

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:34.900
So please don't be so sad.

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.900
A mother wants to remember her child.
Who could possibly stop that?

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:39.570
Not even the Almighty can stop that.

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:43.540
Even if the world
and everyone in it forgets,

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:46.240
as long as her mother remembers,
that's all that matters.

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:50.750
And Mi So, from up there in the skies,

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:54.080
is remembering her mom too.

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:37.260
Nothing beats shopping
at a department store.

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:41.060
The luxury section was incredible.
They had all the new arrivals.

00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:45.500
What do you think you're doing?

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:48.240
What does it look like?
I just went shopping.

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:51.980
Fine, you went shopping.
But why are you making a scene here?

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:53.980
This is all for Se Ri.

00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:56.080
Give them to her at home.

00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:58.320
What? For Se Ri?

00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:02.120
This is my first gift for Se Ri,
so make sure you give them to her.

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:04.390
They're all imported, so she'll love them.

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:06.120
You...

00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:08.630
have no idea what today is, do you?

00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:11.730
Then again,

00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:15.000
how would a monster like you know?

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:17.700
Keep them for yourself!

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:28.350
You're feeling a mother's love
for Se Ri, aren't you?

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:30.950
Right?

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:35.620
She's the reason your daughter's dead,
but you don't hate her, do you?

00:23:36.050 --> 00:23:38.320
You might have hated her,
but you don't now. Am I right?

00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:40.690
Right now, you're worried sick about her.

00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:42.290
You're scared she'll break down,
aren't you?

00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:44.560
- No!
- Stop lying.

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:48.670
If that weren't true, why did you
stop me from saying something...

00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:51.500
that would devastate Se Ri
when you signed the divorce papers?

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:54.440
That was just...

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:56.040
Do you know why you did that?

00:23:56.970 --> 00:23:58.210
Because blood calls to blood.

00:23:58.810 --> 00:24:00.980
As her mother,
you feel a blood tie to Se Ri.

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:03.480
Just stop with the nonsense!

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:07.350
If my blood calls to anyone,
it's to Mi So.

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:08.690
Mi So is my daughter!

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:12.020
No! Mi So isn't your daughter.

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:16.060
You're insane. What kind of father
says that on the day his daughter died?

00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:19.260
Are you even human?

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:22.600
Actually, I'm ecstatic.

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:25.970
Your daughter, my daughter,
our daughter...

00:24:26.370 --> 00:24:29.870
is alive and well.
Why wouldn't I be thrilled as her dad?

00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:35.180
If you don't believe me, come with me.

00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:37.950
Let go!

00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:51.160
What are you doing?
Are you crazy? Stop it!

00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:00.870
Look.

00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:03.170
Look at this. See?

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:08.040
It's a 99-percent match!

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:11.180
That means these two are
without a doubt parent and child.

00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:12.880
Who do you think this is about?

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:15.220
It's you and Se Ri.

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:18.420
Stop talking nonsense!

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:22.230
You're being disgusting
and absolutely horrible!

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:26.160
Your toothbrush went missing
a few days ago, right? So did Se Ri's.

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:29.570
Min Soo Jung wanted
Min Kyung Chae's toothbrush,

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:31.070
but she grabbed yours by mistake.

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:33.870
She suspected Min Kyung Chae and Se Ri
were mother and daughter,

00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:35.670
so she secretly ran a DNA test.

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:38.740
Her plan was to use it
to blackmail Min Kyung Chae.

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:44.110
But things got twisted, and you and Se Ri
ended up getting the DNA test instead.

00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:46.550
And these are the results.

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:48.250
That's impossible.

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:51.320
I clearly gave birth to Mi So myself.

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:52.920
It's a fact everyone knows,
from the skies to earth.

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:54.790
On that same day, Min Kyung Chae...

00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:56.830
also gave birth
to the late Jung Ho Se's daughter.

00:25:57.330 --> 00:25:59.700
You know Se Ri and Mi So share a birthday,
don't you?

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:03.330
You passed out after giving birth...

00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:04.570
and were rushed off
in an ambulance that day.

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:08.510
Min Kyung Chae's newborn daughter
was in that ambulance too.

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:13.280
Are you saying...

00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:18.820
the two babies were switched that day?

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:21.950
If you don't believe me,
run the test yourself.

00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:24.320
Find out what your relationship
with Se Ri really is.

00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:26.890
Then what about Mi So?

00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:29.860
I already told you. She's Min Kyung Chae
and Jung Ho Se's daughter.

00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:32.930
So, in the end, the girl who jumped
from here wasn't our daughter,

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.030
but Min Kyung Chae's.

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:41.140
Aren't we lucky? Our daughter is alive.

00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:44.240
Who cares if some other kid lives or dies?

00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:46.610
All that matters is that
our daughter is alive and well.

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:49.150
So from now on,

00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:51.610
the three of us will become
the owners of Mingang.

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:54.920
Just focus on us becoming
the true owner family, will you?

00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:58.590
Both you and I...

00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:02.030
have to do whatever it takes as parents...

00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:04.960
to make Se Ri the new owner of Mingang.

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:10.130
So forget about a kid like Mi So
and focus only on our Se Ri.

00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:13.870
Look, to be blunt, it was for the best
that she died back then.

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:16.010
Just imagine if she had lived.

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:17.640
You would've worked yourself to death,

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:19.210
and she would've only ruined
Se Ri's future.

00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:22.810
So, when she died,

00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:26.520
it really was for the best.
She took care of the problem herself.

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:53.880
This is insane.

00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:56.180
This can't be happening.

00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:57.780
How could my Mi So...

00:27:57.780 --> 00:27:59.650
No.

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:01.950
No!

00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:05.060
No!

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:36.850
