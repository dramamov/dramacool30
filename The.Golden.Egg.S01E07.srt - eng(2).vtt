WEBVTT

00:00:05.577 --> 00:00:06.978
It's not a coincidence!

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:09.848
How did I not notice until now?

00:00:09.914 --> 00:00:10.949
MYSTERIOUS DEATHS

00:00:11.015 --> 00:00:12.050
KOTA KUBOZUKA

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.991
Mr. Aoshiro is connected
to the serial mysterious deaths.

00:00:23.361 --> 00:00:25.363
SPECIAL RECEPTION ROOM

00:00:26.764 --> 00:00:28.266
Okay, here we go.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:33.338
Thank you.

00:00:33.404 --> 00:00:34.239
Thank you.

00:00:34.772 --> 00:00:36.107
My clothes were okay.

00:00:36.174 --> 00:00:37.609
Sorry for the commotion.

00:00:38.143 --> 00:00:40.011
I took a few pics up front.

00:00:40.078 --> 00:00:40.945
Okay.

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:43.348
Please don't be so nervous.

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.626
Once again, thank you for coming in today.

00:00:54.692 --> 00:00:56.394
It's my pleasure.

00:00:56.961 --> 00:01:01.633
First, I wanted to get your thoughts on
common labor issues from the perspective

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:03.334
of a young businessman.

00:01:04.235 --> 00:01:05.770
Let's see.

00:01:06.471 --> 00:01:12.277
Regarding labor issues,
we have to address older and younger…

00:01:14.612 --> 00:01:16.114
RECORDING

00:01:16.181 --> 00:01:17.382
QUESTION SHEET

00:01:17.448 --> 00:01:21.085
It's no use, none of this
is entering my brain.

00:01:21.653 --> 00:01:22.954
What do I do?

00:01:24.155 --> 00:01:26.891
He's not the culprit
of any incidents, is he?

00:01:42.073 --> 00:01:46.077
I thought I was talking to an empty shell
when the interview started.

00:01:46.144 --> 00:01:47.412
I'm terribly sorry.

00:01:47.478 --> 00:01:50.648
But then you got over it
and finally relaxed.

00:01:50.715 --> 00:01:53.051
You really grabbed my interest.

00:01:53.117 --> 00:01:54.385
Thank you.

00:01:55.053 --> 00:01:57.956
-Okay, I can see myself out from here.
-Sure.

00:01:58.022 --> 00:02:00.191
Let me know when it will be published.

00:02:00.258 --> 00:02:01.092
I will.

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:02.393
Have a good day.

00:02:03.728 --> 00:02:04.929
Thank you.

00:02:06.998 --> 00:02:13.338
It would be even more amazing if you
could exchange personal numbers with him.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.381
What do I do?

00:02:24.282 --> 00:02:28.987
If he really is involved in these deaths,
giving him my contact is dangerous.

00:02:29.687 --> 00:02:36.027
But if he is involved, I know it's best
if I can create a personal connection.

00:02:37.895 --> 00:02:39.797
What do I do?

00:03:02.654 --> 00:03:05.223
Wait, excuse me!

00:03:06.291 --> 00:03:10.595
If you would like to meet up again
sometime, this is my private information.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.567
I could tell you about what goes on behind
the scenes at a tabloid.

00:03:18.102 --> 00:03:19.570
I would be interested in that.

00:03:20.338 --> 00:03:21.205
You'd tell me?

00:03:21.272 --> 00:03:22.974
Yes, off the record.

00:03:24.008 --> 00:03:25.043
Sounds interesting.

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:28.980
Later then.

00:03:29.047 --> 00:03:30.581
Thank you for your time.

00:03:48.766 --> 00:03:50.001
You can head down.

00:03:50.501 --> 00:03:53.204
Could you confirm one thing for me?

00:03:53.271 --> 00:03:54.205
What's that?

00:03:54.772 --> 00:03:57.809
I'm sure you know about Kota Kubozuka,

00:03:57.875 --> 00:04:00.345
the fugitive for the serial
mysterious deaths.

00:04:00.411 --> 00:04:04.749
Is it just a coincidence that Kubozuka
and Aoshiro are from Niigata?

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:12.857
Did Murai tell you something?

00:04:13.391 --> 00:04:18.162
Even if you happen to notice or
realize something in the middle of it,

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.398
try to keep your poker face.

00:04:20.465 --> 00:04:24.502
But they're not the same age,
so they're not connected, right?

00:04:27.772 --> 00:04:30.508
They both went to the same elementary
and middle schools.

00:04:31.075 --> 00:04:32.510
Do they know each other?

00:04:33.845 --> 00:04:36.547
Kubozuka frequently got in trouble
since he was young,

00:04:36.614 --> 00:04:39.650
and was sentenced with probation
while in high school.

00:04:40.585 --> 00:04:42.186
You knew that, right?

00:04:42.253 --> 00:04:43.087
Yes.

00:04:43.721 --> 00:04:47.959
He came to Tokyo after that, and met up
with Aoshiro a number of times.

00:04:49.994 --> 00:04:51.796
I can't believe they're connected.

00:04:52.363 --> 00:04:57.635
One is a suspect in suspicious deaths,
the other a young fashion tycoon.

00:04:57.702 --> 00:04:59.971
Do you know something else?

00:05:03.541 --> 00:05:07.011
You weren't put on this job last minute

00:05:07.078 --> 00:05:09.614
because they were worried about me, right?

00:05:20.458 --> 00:05:23.694
It was my chance to see
Seiya Aoshiro up close.

00:05:24.495 --> 00:05:25.430
Up until today

00:05:26.631 --> 00:05:28.266
I only got him from afar.

00:05:29.066 --> 00:05:29.967
What?

00:05:31.736 --> 00:05:33.738
How long were you watching him?

00:05:34.238 --> 00:05:36.474
You should hear the rest from Murai.

00:05:39.844 --> 00:05:43.080
Does Mr. Aoshiro know where Kubozuka is?

00:05:43.147 --> 00:05:44.782
I have no idea.

00:05:52.089 --> 00:05:53.624
SEIYA AOSHIRO:
THIS IS AOSHIRO

00:05:55.693 --> 00:05:57.261
It's from Mr. Aoshiro.

00:05:57.328 --> 00:05:58.796
What should I do?

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:02.467
What?

00:06:07.672 --> 00:06:10.508
Things are getting interesting!

00:06:16.581 --> 00:06:18.349
Let's not waste any food.

00:06:40.805 --> 00:06:41.706
Mr. Murai.

00:06:42.907 --> 00:06:44.075
Welcome back.

00:06:44.141 --> 00:06:45.943
I wanted to ask you something.

00:06:46.444 --> 00:06:48.980
Is it true that Aoshiro and Kubozuka

00:06:50.915 --> 00:06:53.818
are old acquaintances
from the same hometown?

00:06:56.654 --> 00:06:58.222
Suzaki must have told you.

00:06:59.090 --> 00:06:59.924
Yes.

00:07:11.068 --> 00:07:12.603
NATURAL GREEN TEA

00:07:18.075 --> 00:07:19.010
Are you scared?

00:07:20.678 --> 00:07:22.013
To be honest,

00:07:23.047 --> 00:07:23.881
yes.

00:07:25.283 --> 00:07:27.618
Will I have to interview him again?

00:07:29.287 --> 00:07:30.988
That's up to you.

00:07:32.323 --> 00:07:33.891
Someone else can do it if you're scared.

00:07:35.226 --> 00:07:36.494
Nobody's forcing you.

00:07:40.264 --> 00:07:42.266
I got a reply from Mr. Aoshiro.

00:07:43.134 --> 00:07:46.304
-I managed to get his personal contact.
-Oh?

00:07:47.939 --> 00:07:49.440
This is wonderful.

00:07:50.007 --> 00:07:51.208
This is plenty already!

00:07:54.712 --> 00:07:58.082
All you'd need to do is contact him,
and we'll do the rest.

00:08:00.484 --> 00:08:01.886
You really did a great job.

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:04.055
Thank you.

00:08:13.664 --> 00:08:14.565
But…

00:08:16.767 --> 00:08:22.607
He gave me his personal number
because he trusted me, right?

00:08:25.977 --> 00:08:32.149
If someone else showed up,
it would be like I betrayed him.

00:08:34.552 --> 00:08:36.721
If he's really connected to Kubozuka,

00:08:36.787 --> 00:08:41.125
I feel like I'd meet the real him
when I ask him that.

00:08:43.995 --> 00:08:48.532
I want to hear it from him directly,
without any pretense or reservations.

00:08:49.066 --> 00:08:49.900
So…

00:08:54.639 --> 00:08:56.807
Would you allow me to do this?

00:09:00.678 --> 00:09:01.679
Please!

00:09:10.154 --> 00:09:10.988
Okay.

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:15.059
We might ask you to in due time.

00:09:17.428 --> 00:09:21.932
I'm reassured knowing you're willing
to tackle this yourself.

00:09:23.634 --> 00:09:24.902
Thank you.

00:09:27.772 --> 00:09:28.839
Mr. Murai.

00:09:28.906 --> 00:09:31.475
You had a call from that stylist, Iijima.

00:09:31.542 --> 00:09:33.844
I told her you'll call her back.

00:09:33.911 --> 00:09:35.346
Did she say anything?

00:09:35.913 --> 00:09:37.915
She said to bring a young woman.

00:09:39.183 --> 00:09:40.384
What's that about?

00:09:40.451 --> 00:09:41.786
No idea.

00:09:42.353 --> 00:09:44.221
-But it can't be you, apparently.
-Huh?

00:09:44.288 --> 00:09:45.122
Why not?

00:09:47.758 --> 00:09:48.926
Well, thanks.

00:09:56.567 --> 00:09:58.602
Something's set in motion.

00:10:02.673 --> 00:10:05.643
I feel like I'm getting dragged
into something again.

00:10:09.814 --> 00:10:12.883
Or maybe I'm already involved in it.

00:10:14.151 --> 00:10:19.623
Actually, it almost feels like
I dragged myself into it.

00:10:22.326 --> 00:10:24.528
Excuse me, you called for me?

00:10:26.664 --> 00:10:29.100
I should give you a proper explanation.

00:10:29.633 --> 00:10:31.702
-Can you take notes?
-Yes.

00:10:39.043 --> 00:10:40.811
The first incident.

00:10:40.878 --> 00:10:43.514
The deceased is Harue Komiyama, age 39,

00:10:43.581 --> 00:10:45.182
a beauty consultant.

00:10:45.249 --> 00:10:49.620
Her cause of death was strangulation
from the straps of her bag.

00:10:49.687 --> 00:10:53.190
They're exploring both routes of it
being an accident or murder.

00:10:53.257 --> 00:10:55.192
The day before her death,

00:10:55.259 --> 00:10:58.496
a witness had seen her with Kubozuka.

00:10:59.029 --> 00:11:03.434
The second victim is Yuko Kizaki,
age 32, office worker.

00:11:03.934 --> 00:11:07.271
Her cause of death was strangulation
by a thin rope.

00:11:07.338 --> 00:11:09.173
It's declared a murder.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:13.043
There was a crack in the case,
and the fingerprints at the scene

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:14.612
are identified as Kubozuka's.

00:11:14.678 --> 00:11:15.546
What?

00:11:15.613 --> 00:11:17.915
The building cameras also caught a figure.

00:11:18.516 --> 00:11:20.684
And chances are high it's Kubozuka.

00:11:21.118 --> 00:11:22.186
This case, too?

00:11:22.253 --> 00:11:27.691
The third victim is Makiko Tanioka,
age 28, a jewelry shop worker.

00:11:27.758 --> 00:11:30.594
Her cause of death was traumatic shock

00:11:30.661 --> 00:11:34.532
from injuries she sustained
in a car accident.

00:11:34.598 --> 00:11:38.636
But as they found sedatives
in her bloodwork,

00:11:38.702 --> 00:11:41.939
it's being explored as a possible murder
as well.

00:11:42.506 --> 00:11:44.575
When they checked her phone logs,

00:11:44.642 --> 00:11:47.244
they found an exchange with Kubozuka.

00:11:48.913 --> 00:11:51.849
They were supposed to meet that day.

00:11:52.449 --> 00:11:54.385
Footprints from near the accident

00:11:54.451 --> 00:11:58.155
matched with the footprints
from the second case.

00:12:00.391 --> 00:12:03.794
In other words, the only thing
tying the victims together

00:12:04.528 --> 00:12:07.731
is their contact with Kubozuka.

00:12:08.599 --> 00:12:12.069
That's everything we know about
the serial accidental deaths.

00:12:16.473 --> 00:12:18.876
Um, I've been thinking about something.

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:20.678
About Aoshiro?

00:12:21.779 --> 00:12:22.613
Yes.

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:27.117
Kubozuka and Mr. Aoshiro were
in contact in Tokyo, right?

00:12:27.184 --> 00:12:29.186
Is he connected to the crimes?

00:12:29.954 --> 00:12:31.956
This hasn't been made public,

00:12:32.923 --> 00:12:36.861
but we have information that Aoshiro
knew the second victim.

00:12:39.496 --> 00:12:41.031
Yuko Kizaki.

00:12:41.932 --> 00:12:45.803
From what we heard,
Aoshiro was quite shocked.

00:12:47.037 --> 00:12:50.040
He refuses to believe Kubozuka
is involved.

00:12:50.641 --> 00:12:53.944
Apparently, Aoshiro told Kubozuka
he wants him to turn himself in

00:12:54.011 --> 00:12:55.479
and prove his innocence.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.449
So Mr. Aoshiro isn't involved
with the case.

00:12:59.483 --> 00:13:02.953
Yuko Kizaki's body was discovered
the day after her death.

00:13:03.554 --> 00:13:06.390
Aoshiro was actually in Singapore
for business

00:13:06.957 --> 00:13:09.560
over the entire week at the time
of her death.

00:13:10.127 --> 00:13:11.462
So he has an alibi.

00:13:12.029 --> 00:13:13.230
It appears he does.

00:13:14.164 --> 00:13:15.900
I'm a little relieved.

00:13:22.306 --> 00:13:23.307
Do you know her?

00:13:24.441 --> 00:13:25.843
EMIKO IIJIMA

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:27.711
No, I don't.

00:13:27.778 --> 00:13:30.814
She's a stylist I know called Iijima.

00:13:31.882 --> 00:13:34.451
The reason we know all these details

00:13:34.518 --> 00:13:38.789
is because Iijima picks up
all sorts of rumors.

00:13:39.857 --> 00:13:45.029
What got you looking into these cases
in the first place?

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:49.566
When the first case was reported
on the news,

00:13:49.633 --> 00:13:51.502
I got a call from Iijima.

00:13:52.803 --> 00:13:54.571
Komiyama's my best friend!

00:13:54.638 --> 00:13:56.774
She wouldn't kill herself there!

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:57.841
But still,

00:13:58.509 --> 00:14:04.014
Sengoku Weekly needs some sort of proof
it could've been murder to take action.

00:14:04.915 --> 00:14:07.685
Komiyama was attending modeling seminars.

00:14:07.751 --> 00:14:10.020
Someone there might know something.

00:14:12.122 --> 00:14:13.524
What's this picture?

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:15.392
A group photo of the attendees.

00:14:15.459 --> 00:14:17.027
They're all aspiring models.

00:14:17.094 --> 00:14:18.796
Komiyama's on the far right.

00:14:19.964 --> 00:14:25.269
Actually, right before she died, she told
me she was going on a date with a guy.

00:14:25.336 --> 00:14:27.705
But she didn't tell me who.

00:14:27.771 --> 00:14:32.910
Iijima helped facilitate interviews
with those girls,

00:14:33.677 --> 00:14:36.313
questioning each of them on our behalf.

00:14:37.348 --> 00:14:42.252
Save for one of them, Madoka Hashimoto,
who she could never reach.

00:14:43.387 --> 00:14:45.456
So you sent me to find her workplace.

00:14:45.522 --> 00:14:48.826
You did great,
but we still don't know where she is.

00:14:49.493 --> 00:14:54.298
You didn't know Kubozuka was involved in
Ms. Komiyama's death at the time, right?

00:14:56.066 --> 00:15:01.805
The unnatural death and the missing
school girl felt fishy, so I ran it down.

00:15:02.773 --> 00:15:08.345
I had no idea it would be connected
to other murders.

00:15:10.247 --> 00:15:14.418
After a second and third case
and the announcement of a wanted fugitive,

00:15:14.485 --> 00:15:17.187
my job switched to tracking down Kubozuka.

00:15:19.123 --> 00:15:21.191
And she was the catalyst.

00:15:21.258 --> 00:15:23.360
Right, and this Ms. Iijima

00:15:23.427 --> 00:15:27.931
found a friend of the third victim,
Makiko Tanioka.

00:15:28.766 --> 00:15:31.802
-What?
-I want to get more details,

00:15:31.869 --> 00:15:34.138
but she's demanding a young woman.

00:15:35.105 --> 00:15:36.874
She'll explain why after we meet.

00:15:38.809 --> 00:15:39.943
So you brought me in?

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:41.045
Okay.

00:15:41.111 --> 00:15:42.279
Let's go.

00:15:43.213 --> 00:15:44.915
Huh? Right now?

00:15:44.982 --> 00:15:45.983
-Yup.
-What?

00:15:47.017 --> 00:15:50.721
You said you wouldn't talk unless
I brought a young woman.

00:15:50.788 --> 00:15:52.923
So I did what you asked.

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:55.025
Don't say it like that.

00:15:55.092 --> 00:15:56.093
STYLIST
EMIKO IIJIMA

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:58.328
So what about Tanioka's friend?

00:15:58.395 --> 00:15:59.563
She coming here?

00:16:01.598 --> 00:16:04.268
Tanioka's best friend.

00:16:04.334 --> 00:16:05.536
NIKO-CHAN

00:16:05.602 --> 00:16:06.537
Niko-chan?

00:16:06.603 --> 00:16:08.939
My best friend told me about her,

00:16:09.006 --> 00:16:11.275
but neither she or I have met her.

00:16:11.341 --> 00:16:14.344
No picture, no real name,
won't answer the phone,

00:16:14.411 --> 00:16:15.913
meaning she's extra careful.

00:16:16.413 --> 00:16:18.182
Have you exchanged messages?

00:16:18.248 --> 00:16:19.149
Yes.

00:16:19.216 --> 00:16:23.454
Ms. Tanioka asked Niko-chan
to hold onto something for her

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:25.322
shortly before her death.

00:16:25.389 --> 00:16:27.791
But she won't tell me what.

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:32.096
If she knows something about the case,

00:16:32.162 --> 00:16:35.232
I told her she should tell the cops.

00:16:35.299 --> 00:16:37.501
But she said she hates cops,
so she refused.

00:16:39.369 --> 00:16:41.038
So the police don't know either.

00:16:41.605 --> 00:16:46.143
And when I asked to meet her in person,
she asked for my address.

00:16:47.945 --> 00:16:50.147
That's when I got a party invite.

00:16:51.949 --> 00:16:53.350
Party invite?

00:16:53.417 --> 00:16:55.652
A mixer held by a marriage agency.

00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:00.491
Niko-chan's going to be there
this coming Sunday.

00:17:01.158 --> 00:17:02.626
She told me to meet her there.

00:17:03.427 --> 00:17:04.528
Whose invite is this?

00:17:05.295 --> 00:17:10.434
Ms. Tanioka said she didn't need to go
to the mixer because she found a good man

00:17:10.501 --> 00:17:11.935
and gave it to Niko-chan.

00:17:12.002 --> 00:17:13.871
Which she sent to me.

00:17:13.937 --> 00:17:15.172
So that means…

00:17:16.273 --> 00:17:19.276
We have to attend this mixer
to meet Niko-chan.

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:24.148
Only a woman in her 20s can enter
the party with this ticket.

00:17:24.748 --> 00:17:26.583
Which is why I asked for a young woman.

00:17:27.151 --> 00:17:28.385
I see.

00:17:29.386 --> 00:17:32.122
I've never been to a marriage mixer.

00:17:32.189 --> 00:17:33.724
Could be a good experience then.

00:17:34.858 --> 00:17:37.327
We need to confirm things first.

00:17:37.394 --> 00:17:38.829
Right.

00:17:39.796 --> 00:17:41.932
What should I wear--

00:17:41.999 --> 00:17:42.933
No, not that.

00:17:45.435 --> 00:17:47.905
Even if we got in with this ticket,

00:17:47.971 --> 00:17:49.606
how do we meet Niko-chan?

00:17:50.307 --> 00:17:52.509
That's what we need to confirm.

00:17:52.576 --> 00:17:53.944
Oh, like that?

00:17:54.011 --> 00:17:54.845
Nice.

00:17:55.379 --> 00:17:57.414
By the way, you should avoid black.

00:17:58.148 --> 00:18:00.150
I appreciate the advice.

00:18:00.217 --> 00:18:02.886
You own a different bag, right?

00:18:02.953 --> 00:18:05.088
Let me see you without your glasses.

00:18:05.155 --> 00:18:06.223
Okay.

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:07.791
Leave them on.

00:18:08.458 --> 00:18:10.861
-What?
-It's better with them on.

00:18:22.239 --> 00:18:24.775
I've never dressed like this before.

00:18:25.375 --> 00:18:26.610
Is this okay?

00:18:27.444 --> 00:18:29.980
What if I end up with a boyfriend?

00:18:30.614 --> 00:18:31.548
Wait, no.

00:18:32.082 --> 00:18:33.951
I'm undercover today.

00:18:34.017 --> 00:18:36.453
I have to blend in without standing out.

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:38.622
Your posture is important.

00:18:39.156 --> 00:18:41.491
First, straighten up your back.

00:18:41.558 --> 00:18:43.894
Take small, dainty steps.

00:18:45.529 --> 00:18:47.864
And smile naturally.

00:18:49.766 --> 00:18:51.068
Then you're set!

00:18:51.134 --> 00:18:52.736
Nothing to worry about!

00:19:05.782 --> 00:19:07.284
You're Makiko Tanioka?

00:19:08.919 --> 00:19:09.753
Yes.

00:19:10.954 --> 00:19:12.990
Thank you for coming today.

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:25.969
Ms. Tanioka? Ms. Makiko Tanioka?

00:19:28.372 --> 00:19:29.573
You left your bag.

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:30.807
I'm so sorry!

00:19:48.392 --> 00:19:49.960
TO BE CONTINUED

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:52.329
An undercover investigation?!

00:19:52.396 --> 00:19:54.564
What are you doing? Stop it!

00:19:54.631 --> 00:19:57.034
What was their relationship
to the late Ms. Tanioka?

00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:00.070
You suck! You think tabloids
can do whatever they want?

00:20:00.137 --> 00:20:04.975
My job is to see the truth about the world
with my own eyes and tell the readers!

00:20:05.042 --> 00:20:05.942
