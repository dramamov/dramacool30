00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.799
Master.

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:15.819
By the way,

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.260
verified things

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:17.900
with Bai Cha?

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.299
I went to Cheng Nuo.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.099
He said

00:01:20.099 --> 00:01:21.000
he sent her

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.319
to another city
with better medical resources.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.019
So I asked him to video call her,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.340
but she never answered.

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:29.540
So this matter

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:30.659
remains unresolved.

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:34.120
We might have been deceived.

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:35.180
Let's go to him.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.819
Honey,

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:53.560
your hands are so cold.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.040
Are you nervous?

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:56.079
Honey,

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.799
I've seen it all.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.040
Do I look nervous?

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:01.519
Yes,

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:02.920
you're

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:05.260
the revered goddess CEO.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.540
I should be

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.700
the nervous one.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:08.659
You

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:09.879
always mock me.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.379
By the way,

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:13.340
I prepared a gift for you.

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:14.520
What is it?

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.199
Open it and see.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:26.439
Okay.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.800
(It's Na's clothes.)

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.860
(Na...)

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:43.560
(This beast is so paranoid.)

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:45.719
(He's still testing me.)

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:51.120
Honey,

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:52.879
is this a piece of clothing?

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.919
Yes.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.759
But the texture

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.020
feels unusual.

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:00.819
On the fabric,

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:02.219
there are dyed patterns.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.020
What patterns?

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:07.360
An ocean,

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.919
meaning even to the ends of the earth,

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.680
you'll always stay by my side.

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:13.500
Honey,

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.240
you're truly romantic.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.699
Do you like it?

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:17.780
Yes.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:22.500
As long as you like it.

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:54.479
Sirs.

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.979
Sirs,

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.580
wait.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:56.319
Please wait.

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:57.500
What brings you here?

00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:58.699
We want to see Mr. Cheng.

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:00.060
Please wait here.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.740
I'll inform him.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:01.300
No need.

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:02.120
I'll go directly.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.300
Cheng Nuo!

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:09.060
Mr. Cheng,

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:10.319
I'm sorry,

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:15.699
Mr. Luo,

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.980
want some water?

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:17.680
No need.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:22.660
Where is your wife's corpse?

00:04:24.579 --> 00:04:25.180
Mr. Luo,

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:27.060
she is alive and well.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.899
Watch your language.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:30.220
Cheng Nuo,

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.379
I've handled

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:33.660
many bizarre cases.

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:35.180
My instincts

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:36.500
have never been wrong.

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:38.259
Don't fool me.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:40.500
You didn't harm her,

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:42.360
but what are you hiding?

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.420
Did Ye Dong offer you something

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:45.420
to cover for him?

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:50.060
No wonder you're a detective.

00:04:50.459 --> 00:04:51.459
Such wild imagination.

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:53.379
I said

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:55.399
my wife is alive.

00:04:58.459 --> 00:04:59.040
Fine.

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:00.100
Then tell me

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:01.779
which hospital

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:03.579
she is at,

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:05.040
the ward number

00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:06.540
and attending physician.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:10.100
I don't think

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.399
I need to tell you that.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.600
You'd better

00:05:13.459 --> 00:05:14.779
cooperate with our investigation.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.800
Otherwise,

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:17.620
I'll have to take you in.

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:23.879
You're

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.500
really looking out for me.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.800
Fine.

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:27.879
Listen,

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:30.800
she is at Wangjiang Hospital

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:32.079
in another city.

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.800
Ward 302.

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:35.399
Her attending physician

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:36.220
is Zhang Mo.

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:37.540
Is that enough?

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:40.019
Call

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:40.699
and verify it.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:41.540
Yes.

00:05:50.899 --> 00:05:53.420
Your office is full of her photos.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.019
You two love each other deeply.

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:00.259
Of course.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.819
Our love

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:04.279
has always been strong.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.980
But

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:08.259
these aren't recent photos.

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.439
Got any of her older photos?

00:06:11.899 --> 00:06:12.899
These were

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.060
taken after we got together.

00:06:15.459 --> 00:06:16.060
Before that,

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.220
she didn't take any.

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:21.180
Where did she work before?

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:23.660
She

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:26.040
used to be a DJ at a nightclub.

00:06:28.019 --> 00:06:29.079
Doesn't that bother you?

00:06:32.579 --> 00:06:33.560
Do you know

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:34.819
Ye Dong

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:36.699
used to work as a security guard

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.019
at her workplace?

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:41.300
After meeting him that time,

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.000
she confessed to me.

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:45.240
They did have a history.

00:06:47.819 --> 00:06:49.180
On the day she died,

00:06:49.939 --> 00:06:50.980
the cameras captured

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.180
they were

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.040
in the same car.

00:06:54.399 --> 00:06:55.480
Aren't you worried

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:56.420
they might still

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:57.399
be involved?

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:01.019
Mr. Luo,

00:07:01.579 --> 00:07:02.740
I'll say this one last time.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:04.379
My wife is not dead.

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:05.699
She's very much alive.

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:06.259
Alright.

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:06.759
Fine.

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:08.319
Then I'll

00:07:09.259 --> 00:07:10.120
rephrase my question.

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:11.800
Is there any chance her fall

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:13.560
had anything

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.279
to do with Ye Dong?

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:19.759
I've said this repeatedly.

00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:22.339
That was an accident.

00:07:22.339 --> 00:07:23.980
No one else was involved.

00:07:31.699 --> 00:07:32.220
Master,

00:07:32.379 --> 00:07:33.060
I've verified.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:34.399
All's true.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:39.699
Mr. Cheng,

00:07:40.819 --> 00:07:41.560
I'll leave you be.

00:07:59.339 --> 00:08:00.879
See? Nothing to worry about.

00:08:01.579 --> 00:08:02.100
You're

00:08:02.339 --> 00:08:04.300
not always right.

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:07.360
Go to Wangjiang Hospital.

00:08:07.579 --> 00:08:08.879
Regardless of what others say,

00:08:08.939 --> 00:08:10.639
verify Bai Cha's identity

00:08:10.939 --> 00:08:11.839
with your own eyes.

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:13.319
Master,

00:08:13.639 --> 00:08:14.139
this

00:08:14.139 --> 00:08:15.019
isn't necessary.

00:08:15.019 --> 00:08:16.000
That's an order.

00:08:16.579 --> 00:08:17.079
Get lost.

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:18.079
Yes.

00:08:28.759 --> 00:08:29.399
Dong, Ms. Lin,

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:30.139
we're here.

00:08:30.899 --> 00:08:31.420
Honey,

00:08:32.059 --> 00:08:32.740
let me help you.

00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:34.019
Okay.

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:46.740
Mr. Ye,

00:08:47.059 --> 00:08:48.200
what are you doing?

00:09:00.259 --> 00:09:01.820
We don't need her anymore.

00:09:02.019 --> 00:09:02.620
Mu Feng,

00:09:03.059 --> 00:09:03.799
take her back.

00:09:04.539 --> 00:09:05.039
Yes.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:07.120
Outrageous.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.000
He's crossing the line.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:09.820
Controls everything.

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.580
Why does Ms. Lin trust him so much?

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:13.279
He's just a live-in son-in-law.

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:14.120
He's here.

00:09:16.179 --> 00:09:17.200
Why is he alone?

00:09:18.899 --> 00:09:19.899
Thank you for waiting.

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:21.460
I'll chair

00:09:21.679 --> 00:09:22.600
today's meeting.

00:09:23.059 --> 00:09:24.080
Any objections?

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:26.379
Ye Dong,

00:09:26.539 --> 00:09:28.059
you don't regard us

00:09:28.059 --> 00:09:28.960
with any respect.

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:30.399
You aren't

00:09:30.399 --> 00:09:31.639
the acting CEO yet.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.360
Even if you're the CEO,

00:09:33.539 --> 00:09:35.240
we can unite and oust you.

00:09:36.379 --> 00:09:37.080
Exactly.

00:09:37.659 --> 00:09:38.980
Out of respect for Ms. Lin,

00:09:39.159 --> 00:09:40.500
if you have sense,

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:42.059
we might support you.

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:43.299
But

00:09:43.419 --> 00:09:44.700
you're so arrogant.

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:45.299
Today,

00:09:45.799 --> 00:09:47.320
I'll never agree

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:47.980
to make you

00:09:48.259 --> 00:09:49.879
the acting CEO.

00:09:50.559 --> 00:09:51.500
- Me neither.
- Exactly.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:52.460
I disagree.

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:54.200
All of you

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:55.440
are being ridiculous.

00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:58.700
If you disagree,

00:09:59.159 --> 00:10:00.220
withdraw your investments.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.019
Does Jiuyao Group

00:10:02.899 --> 00:10:03.940
lack capital?

00:10:04.799 --> 00:10:05.460
Ye Dong,

00:10:05.779 --> 00:10:07.159
who do you think you are?

00:10:07.299 --> 00:10:08.179
Even Ms. Lin

00:10:08.179 --> 00:10:09.460
wouldn't dare speak that.

00:10:09.899 --> 00:10:11.440
Have you lost your mind?

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:12.299
Ye Dong,

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:14.360
all of us will

00:10:14.639 --> 00:10:16.960
jointly cancel you.

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:18.740
Not even Ms. Lin

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:19.759
could protect you.

00:10:20.179 --> 00:10:21.299
You'll never lead

00:10:21.299 --> 00:10:22.860
Jiuyao Group.

00:10:24.539 --> 00:10:25.379
Shareholders,

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:26.740
Ms. Lin Xia

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:28.820
has transferred
all her Jiuyao Group shares

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:30.259
to Mr. Ye Dong.

00:10:30.759 --> 00:10:31.639
This means

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:33.179
Mr. Ye Dong is now

00:10:33.179 --> 00:10:34.759
the largest shareholder.

00:10:35.019 --> 00:10:36.120
Does anyone here

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:38.039
have the right to expel him?

00:10:38.659 --> 00:10:39.620
Or rather,

00:10:39.899 --> 00:10:41.580
dare to expel him?
