=Episode 37=

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.900
I volunteer

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.300
to lead

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.620
the delegation to North Qi

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.780
and fulfill your wish.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:54.800
If the peace talks succeed

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.060
and I return safely,

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:57.780
I hope you

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:59.980
can rescind the decree

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.140
and allow me and Wei Yun to be together.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.860
If I fail,

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.700
I will accept any punishment.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.980
To rid Great Sui

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.460
of the danger posed by North Qi,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.100
someone must

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:24.460
take this risk.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:26.500
If this person

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.660
must be chosen from among us,

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.780
let it begin with me.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.140
This journey will be dangerous.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.300
Are you truly willing to go?

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:00.860
Yes.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.980
To defend Fengling, my father died,

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:06.760
and my brother was wounded.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.380
Though I am a woman,

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.100
as their daughter and sister,

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.300
I share their duty.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.420
For Great Sui and you,

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.540
I'm willing

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:18.980
to travel far to North Qi

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.520
to complete the peace talks.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:29.460
Thus,

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.340
I approve.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.980
Chancellor Gu,

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.980
tell North Qi at once

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.180
that our envoys will set out now,

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.460
and they should be prepared
for the peace talks.

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:44.460
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.980
Court is dismissed.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.340
Farewell, Your Majesty.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.860
Thank you for your reminder yesterday.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.740
You're not mad at me

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.860
for what I did to Yu?

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:23.900
I understand your intention.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:26.740
Because of you,

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.580
Yu and I survived a desperate situation.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.960
Everything before this

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:35.540
no longer matters.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.020
Yu,

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:46.620
let's go.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.220
(Huajing City)

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.940
Go back now.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.280
Everyone else has returned.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:25.840
Take care of the family.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:29.660
My Lady,

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:31.700
you're traveling alone,

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.300
with no one at your side.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.220
Take good care of yourself.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:41.580
(Sui)

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:45.660
My Lady...

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.660
My Lady, can't I just go

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.140
with you this time?

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:50.780
If you go,

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.300
I'll have to look after you.

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:53.740
Don't worry.

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.980
I will surely return

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:56.660
in triumph.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.980
(Sui)

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.260
But His Lordship

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.840
is still locked up
in the Arsenal Bureau.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.460
We don't even know
when he'll be released.

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:08.620
It's all right.

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:10.460
When we meet again,

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.180
we can see each other every day.

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:13.660
There's no need to rush.

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:16.620
All right.

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:19.020
I'm leaving.

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:21.900
Yu,

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:22.740
we're here.

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.180
Who said Ms. Chu

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:26.300
is going alone?

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.140
With me around,

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.140
you'll have an extra army.

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:32.020
Why are you here?

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:33.580
I had no choice.

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.500
Young Marquis Wei

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.020
begged me so pitifully.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.060
My greatest flaw

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:41.500
is a soft heart.

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:43.220
Fine.

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:44.840
I'll accompany you on this trip.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.080
You're so good

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:47.140
at flattering yourself.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.540
As soon as Yun mentioned it,

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:51.420
we rushed over.

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:52.780
Yu, don't worry.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.260
With me by your side,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:55.260
you'll surely come back

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:56.100
unscathed.

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:58.520
With you two by my side,

00:06:58.620 --> 00:06:59.860
things will surely be smoother.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:03.340
Goodbye.

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:09.940
(Huajing City)

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:10.980
In Year 6 of Yuanle,

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.340
- (the war paused.)
- Let's go.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.140
(Emperor Chunde of Great Sui)

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.920
(appointed Chu Yu
as an envoy to North Qi)

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:17.810
Take care of my lady!

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:19.780
(to conduct peace talks in Qizhou,)

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.230
(Sui)
(capital of North Qi.)

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:28.700
(Gu Mansion)

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:30.420
Chusheng,

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:32.980
this inkstone looks a bit worn.

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:34.720
I'll buy you a new one someday.

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:40.740
This inkstone

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:42.540
was a gift from Chu Yu.

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.040
I've used it for years.

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:47.420
It's time to replace it.

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:51.860
Chu Yu set out for North Qi today.

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:53.780
Aren't you going to see her off?

00:07:58.140 --> 00:07:59.260
She may not want to see me.

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:02.140
Why should I impose myself?

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:04.940
This journey is dangerous.

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:07.300
I hope she returns soon

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:09.280
and achieves what she wishes.

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:14.480
It was you who let Young Marquis Wei

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:16.060
appear in court, right?

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:18.140
Aren't you afraid the Emperor

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:19.320
will be angry with you?

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.100
The Emperor wished

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:23.540
to temper his sharpness.

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:25.260
Your recommendation

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:26.700
that I be the one to imprison

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:27.540
Young Marquis Wei

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:29.060
was also intentional, wasn't it?

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:32.460
If someone else handled it,

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:34.100
they'd follow orders strictly

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:35.580
and might hurt him.

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:37.580
Great Sui is in need of generals.

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:39.820
He's brave and skilled,

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:41.380
a rare talent in war.

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:43.860
I do not wish to see him fall.

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:49.620
During my days off,

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:50.700
I'll buy a new inkstone

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:51.540
for you.

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:54.300
Thank you, Shilan.

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:02.140
(Sui)

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:05.340
How far have we come?

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.340
Over 20 li from Huajing by now.

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:11.260
What's wrong?

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:12.140
I miss Jin.

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:18.700
Yun is really ruthless.

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.540
This journey might take
a very long time,

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:22.060
yet he didn't even come to see Yu off.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:24.660
He has things he needs to do.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:42.100
Everyone, listen up.

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:43.500
Turn around.

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:58.340
I thought I wouldn't see you.

00:09:58.780 --> 00:09:59.620
Looks like the Bureau

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:00.460
can't trap you.

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:02.300
In this world,

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:03.460
no one can stop me

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:04.340
from seeing you.

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:08.380
Yu,

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:10.020
I know all your planning

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:12.820
is to roam free under this vast sky

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:14.100
without being bound.

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:17.920
But now, for our future,

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:19.980
you willingly accept restraints.

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:22.580
Yu,

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.160
I won't always be locked

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.180
in the Bureau.

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:27.940
I know.

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:34.260
Even if

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:36.180
my hands are tied,

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:38.220
I can still come and go with ease.

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:40.420
Do you know why?

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:43.620
Because I know

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:45.180
that whenever I look back,

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:46.220
you will always be there.

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:11.180
Restrain yourself.

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:12.020
You might get beaten.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:13.180
They won't notice me.

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:14.060
I'm sure.

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:19.760
Do you remember what I told you?

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:23.840
As long as I like you,

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.200
I will do everything I can

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:27.260
to clear all obstacles to return to you.

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:28.900
So, Wei Yun,

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:31.220
wait for me to come back.

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:34.420
Yu,

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:37.740
be extremely careful this time.

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:41.860
Just as you said,

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:43.840
whenever you look back,

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:45.320
I will always be here.

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:56.900
Everyone,

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:58.640
the peace talks in North Qi

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:00.260
will be full of hardships.

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:01.980
Zhao Yue is cunning;

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:03.380
things are unpredictable.

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:06.320
I hope you can return in triumph.

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:10.920
Delegation to North Qi,

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:11.820
depart.

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:27.860
(Sui)

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:34.460
(I won't make you wait too long.)

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:39.940
Your Lordship,

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:40.780
I finally found you.

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:42.900
Mr. Gongsun sent a message by pigeon.

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:44.220
He said he finally has a chance

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:45.100
to see the true face

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:46.380
of your confidante,

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:47.660
and he promised

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:48.640
to give his full support

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:49.600
to Ms. Chu.

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:51.580
I'll reply to him
when I return to the Bureau.

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:53.340
We need our own plan as well.

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:55.300
We can't let Yu fight alone.

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:57.020
I knew it.

00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:58.420
There's no way you'd let

00:12:58.420 --> 00:12:59.360
Ms. Chu face it alone.

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:01.740
Of course not.

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:03.940
After we're back,

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:05.740
I need to see General Song.

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:19.520
Did you see Ms. Chu today?

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:23.020
Thank you for letting me out.

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:29.020
Is this your token of gratitude?

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:32.180
Next time at Spring Breeze House,

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:33.460
everything will be on me.

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:37.340
You always

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:38.590
keep everything

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:39.510
in your heart.

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:41.680
The Emperor distrusts me.

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:44.120
If you hadn't taken this position
in my stead,

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:45.820
I might be in greater danger.

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:48.460
You'd rather bear Wenchang's scolding

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:49.500
than let this fall on me.

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:51.620
To be honest,

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:53.380
I owe you

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:55.660
a drink for that.

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:05.660
You still owe me

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:06.620
one more drink.

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:10.820
Thanks to you,

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:12.060
I was able to see Yu off today.

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:21.860
Thank you.

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:30.610
Actually, the Emperor

00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:32.250
gave me the title of General of the West

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:34.140
only to warn you.

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:37.220
He didn't intend
to strip you of your troops.

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:39.540
That day,

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:41.140
Wenchang asked me

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:42.100
why I had to accept it

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:43.180
when I knew

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:44.580
how dangerous

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:45.740
this decree was.

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:48.260
I said many noble reasons,

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:49.740
but in truth,

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:52.220
I wasn't without selfish motives.

00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:58.620
As a concubine's son,

00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:01.220
I must seize every opportunity

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:03.740
to climb step by step.

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:05.820
Only then

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:08.970
can I realize my ideals

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:10.060
and ambitions.

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:12.940
If you were truly selfish,

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:15.900
you wouldn't have helped me
time and again.

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:18.800
I chose you to go to Qingzhou with me

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:20.670
not only

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:22.270
because of your adaptability,

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:24.780
but because there is a bottom line

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:27.140
in your adaptability.

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:29.260
Your selfishness

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:31.700
has never outweighed the greater good.

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:38.500
Shilan,

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:40.740
you deserve to be

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:43.120
the General of the West.

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:48.460
When I can defeat you,

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:49.700
you can say that again.

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:56.060
Still,

00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:57.700
I didn't expect

00:15:58.020 --> 00:15:59.380
you'd send Wenchang to North Qi.

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:01.660
Very well.

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:03.500
He does need the experience.

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:07.700
In that case,

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:10.980
please work with me

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:14.480
to accomplish another great task.

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:18.740
(Zhonggong Gate)

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:20.860
The delegation of Great Sui is coming.

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:22.460
Yue,

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:24.140
why did you quarrel so fiercely

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:26.020
with the City Lord of Xuan

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:27.300
in court today?

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:28.740
Mother, you know

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:30.320
that my ambition is to annex Great Sui.

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:31.610
Why did you not speak

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:32.670
a single word for me?

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:37.020
I share governance with you

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:38.740
to build up your influence.

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:40.110
By remaining silent,

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:42.310
I was trying to preserve your dignity

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:43.460
before the officials.

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:45.660
Though the City Lord of Xuan

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:48.300
used to serve Su Can,

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:49.580
you only secured

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:51.500
your rule over North Qi

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:53.300
because you married his daughter.

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:55.660
So, you must not embarrass him.

00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:13.300
You are nowhere to be seen most days,

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:15.020
yet today you're so attentive.

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:16.620
Did you also hear

00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:18.100
that the delegation of Great Sui

00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:19.210
is coming?

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:21.700
Missing one's homeland is normal.

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:22.900
However,

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:24.380
I have no intention

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:26.380
of returning anytime soon.

00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:29.620
What if they insist on taking you away?

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:31.420
Do you know

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:33.620
that Chu Yu is part of the delegation?

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:38.780
Do you not trust me?

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:41.060
How could I not trust you?

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:43.240
You are the only one
I trust in this world.

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:50.850
My appetite

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:51.900
has been peculiar lately.

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:53.260
I find

00:17:58.620 --> 00:17:59.580
that grapes

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:01.140
taste sweeter

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:02.660
at night.

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:16.940
I am tired.

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:18.660
I'll go back to rest.

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:36.880
These grapes are very sweet.

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:38.460
Mother, why don't you try one?

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:42.860
Do you want me

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:44.260
to taste a grape,

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:46.500
or are you trying to silence me?

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:49.460
She relies on your favor

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:51.820
and shows no respect for me.

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:53.480
Please calm your anger.

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:55.500
She only wanted a grape.

00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:57.380
As for the delegation

00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:58.220
that concerns you,

00:18:58.940 --> 00:18:59.780
I'll let

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:01.820
Gongsun Lan receive them.

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:12.660
(Qizhou Posthouse)

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:15.100
Everyone, rest here for the night.

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:16.960
Tomorrow, you'll go to meet the King.

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:20.120
What kind of place is this?

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:21.380
Is this how North Qi

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:22.220
treats its guests?

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:23.640
If you refuse to stay,

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:24.640
you can sleep outside.

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:25.700
We are at least

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:27.140
the envoys sent for peace talks.

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:28.540
In your eyes,

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:29.620
are we so easy to bully?

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:32.620
Great Sui is hardly a victor.

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:35.140
You're gravely weakened.

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:37.300
Otherwise, why would you come here?

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:39.100
You brought yourselves here,

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:40.940
yet you expect us to respect you?

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:42.620
Good.

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:44.820
Finally showing your true colors.

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:47.900
Seize those two.

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:51.360
We are officials of the posthouse.

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:53.420
If you dare lay a hand on us,

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:55.500
you will be openly opposing North Qi.

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:56.540
Exactly.

00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:00.580
Look at you,

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:01.520
arrogant and bullying.

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:03.340
Who started this conflict first?

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:05.460
Enough. So noisy.

00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:06.520
Gag them,

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:07.960
tie them up, and throw them outside.

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:10.220
(Qizhou Posthouse)

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:11.220
Behave yourselves.

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:15.340
Yu,

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:17.420
we just arrived. Why provoke them?

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:20.780
Before we left,

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:22.060
the Emperor said

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:23.120
that though we won greatly,

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:24.220
North Qi

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:25.550
was not completely defeated.

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:26.700
So,

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:27.780
on our first day here,

00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:29.380
we can see how they intend to negotiate.

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:31.180
It's easy to meet the King

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:33.000
yet hard to deal with his lackeys.

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:34.640
If those below dare act like this,

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:36.420
the order must have come from above.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:38.460
This is clearly

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:39.580
a show of force.

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:41.420
Tomorrow, we must make them pay.

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:44.380
That's why I retaliated just now.

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:46.660
If we get pushed around once we arrive,

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:47.500
we'll be trampled

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:48.820
all the way through.

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:51.680
But judging from the attitude

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:53.820
of those two underlings,

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:55.220
I fear Zhao Yue

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:56.660
has no intention

00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:57.860
of negotiating with us.

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:00.110
He's just ascended the throne.

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:01.660
With the uncertain domestic situation

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:04.020
and the foreign army at the border,

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:05.300
if I were him,

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:07.420
negotiation wouldn't be impossible.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.040
Of course, I would talk.

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:10.620
But the key

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:12.060
to peace talks is "talk".

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:13.740
If they want a ceasefire,

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:15.020
I could consider it.

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:16.580
But if they propose

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:17.820
any other unreasonable demands,

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:18.940
not a chance.

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:20.420
Of course,

00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:21.580
I also expected

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:22.780
that Zhao Yue would not

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:23.740
agree so easily.

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:26.620
Actually, before we left,

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:28.700
the Emperor gave one more verbal decree.

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:30.220
Wait.

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:33.980
Don't tell me

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:36.380
peace talks are just a pretense.

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:37.820
Does the Emperor

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:39.220
want us to assassinate Zhao Yue?

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:40.500
How can we three do that?

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:42.340
What are you thinking?

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:44.460
The peace talks are a pretense

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:45.700
so that we can approach

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:47.120
the King of North Qi.

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:48.460
But our primary mission

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:49.880
is to bring back the Eldest Princess

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:51.140
at all costs.

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:53.140
I can give them money,

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:55.460
horses, and even silk,

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:58.140
if they want.

00:21:58.660 --> 00:21:59.540
But they can never

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:00.700
take Changming away.

00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:01.900
Mother,

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:03.300
Changming is my only bottom line.

00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:05.860
I can consider all other demands,

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:07.300
but this one

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:09.420
is non-negotiable.

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:10.780
Yue,

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:12.380
you are a ruler of a nation.

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:15.180
Your bottom line should be your people.

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:16.820
Are you willing

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:18.660
to fight another battle for a woman?

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:21.760
Why are you so afraid of Great Sui?

00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:24.740
In Great Sui,

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.580
how many capable generals are there now?

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:27.620
If they really want

00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:28.460
to take Changming,

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:30.340
I will not spare them.

00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:32.340
Even if Zhao Yue wants to kill us,

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:33.860
we will still bring

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:35.100
the Eldest Princess back.

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:36.900
Of course,

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:38.080
we must first enter the Palace

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:39.540
to gauge Zhao Yue's attitude.

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:41.980
The best outcome

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:42.980
is....

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:44.080
Rescue the Eldest Princess.

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:49.120
Reclaim the three cities.

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:53.180
Bring peace to the world.

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:24.820
Chu Yu,

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:27.580
it's really you.

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:30.340
Truly a woman of Great Sui,

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:33.180
not yielding to men.

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:35.940
Don't worry.

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:38.700
I'm safe.

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:41.380
I will be waiting for you.

00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:58.620
You have covered my eyes

00:23:58.620 --> 00:23:59.620
for so long,

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:01.540
saying you'd show me

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:02.620
a wonder.

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:03.940
What wonder?

00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:07.420
Today is your birthday, Your Highness.

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:09.300
The King wants to give you a surprise.

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:16.140
Your Highness.

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:25.140
Your Highness.

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:26.460
Your Highness.

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:10.980
In the past,

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:13.380
I couldn't afford a pearl

00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:14.660
you liked.

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:16.620
Now,

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:17.980
(Bright and Virtuous)

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:19.420
I don't want that regret anymore.

00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:22.740
Unfortunately,

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:25.260
I no longer like pearls.

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:32.100
So,

00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:33.940
is this

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:35.980
the birthday gift you give me?

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:37.740
Do you like it?

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:41.280
From the moment we arrived in North Qi,

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:43.220
I began preparing all of this.

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:46.380
Whether you are Hanmei or Zhao Yue,

00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:48.940
you always please me.

00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:53.700
Why would my followers

00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:56.260
agree to come to North Qi with you

00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:59.220
and follow your orders?

00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:02.000
Changming, have you forgotten?

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:03.300
I know how to use poison.

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:07.220
This is Farewell at Dawn.

00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:09.020
It leaves at dawn

00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:10.180
and returns at night.

00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:12.020
Half a pill

00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:13.460
is addictive.

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:15.240
One must take another half each month

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:17.460
to relieve the bone-deep itch.

00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:20.680
What if someone takes a full pill?

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:22.260
There is no cure.

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:23.740
They'll surely die.

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:28.060
There is one pill left in this bottle.

00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:31.460
It's for you, Changming.

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:42.660
If you still want to leave me,

00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:45.380
I don't mind using it.

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:47.500
But I hope

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:50.020
that day will never come.

00:26:57.740 --> 00:26:58.740
I like this curtain

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:00.180
of pearls,

00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:03.180
and I will accept

00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:04.580
your Farewell at Dawn.

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:05.900
However,

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:07.620
this is not what I truly want.

00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:12.900
The time has come.

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:15.360
The reception of the delegation
cannot be delayed.

00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:18.980
Very well.

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:20.660
I will wait

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:21.540
for you in the hall.

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:27.020
(Qi)

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:43.300
The delegation from Great Sui is here.

00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:13.980
(Chengtian Hall)

00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:45.380
Is Great Sui without men?

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:47.220
The envoy they sent

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:48.660
is only a woman.

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:53.580
Only a woman?

00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:55.820
Your Majesty, weren't you

00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:57.860
already defeated several times

00:29:58.020 --> 00:29:59.260
by this mere woman?

00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:01.020
Did your crossbow workshop

00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:03.300
blow itself up?

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:04.140
Outrageous!

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:06.300
Your Majesty,

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:08.540
I have a question.

00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:10.460
Is North Qi without men?

00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:12.440
You even sent two snobbish officials

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:13.320
to receive us.

00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:15.140
The delegation of Great Sui

00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:17.300
is by no means an easy target.

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:19.700
I will surely write a letter

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:21.140
to inform the Emperor

00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:23.420
of our treatment in North Qi.

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:27.500
No need for that.

00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:29.340
Our King

00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:30.860
would never deliberately mistreat you.

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:34.620
I suppose it was those two officials

00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:35.660
being petty and snobbish.

00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:40.660
That's fine then.

00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:42.700
We've tied them up.

00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:45.180
You can handle them by law.

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:52.060
Of course.

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:53.420
Of course.

00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:58.540
Since you are here for peace talks,

00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:00.940
how do you wish to proceed?

00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:07.100
Before peace talks,

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:10.060
may we first see

00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:11.050
the Eldest Princess?

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:13.380
After the hot spring villa,

00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:15.780
we have had no news of her.

00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:17.300
What?

00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:19.020
You want to take Changming back?

00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:22.380
The Emperor cares deeply for her

00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:24.420
and wishes us to first ensure

00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:25.340
her safety.

00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:29.380
We just want to see

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:30.620
if the Eldest Princess is well.

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:31.940
Is that not allowed?

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:33.580
Who knows?

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:35.180
If North Qi harmed

00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:36.180
the Eldest Princess,

00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:37.980
it's not impossible

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:40.060
they wish to conceal it.

00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:44.500
Yue,

00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:47.340
the envoys' concerns are reasonable.

00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:48.680
We've never

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:50.260
mistreated Li Changming,

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:51.700
so letting them see her

00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:53.220
would do no harm.

00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:02.460
Today happens to be
Changming's birthday.

00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:03.950
I had ordered preparations

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:05.400
for a birthday banquet this morning.

00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:08.500
With envoys from Great Sui present,

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:11.140
Changming will surely be happier.

00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:16.580
(Chengtian Hall, Qi)

00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:44.820
Everyone, rest assured.

00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:47.340
In peace talks, peace comes first.

00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:49.580
But for some matters,

00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:51.420
you should raise them carefully.

00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:54.380
I may not wish to discuss them.

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:03.020
The Eldest Princess
of Great Sui is here.

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:23.740
Your Highness.

00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:27.780
Your Highness,

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:29.300
you have suffered.

00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:31.780
How could that be?

00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:33.860
With my temperament,

00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:35.300
how could I let myself suffer?

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:38.660
Chu Yu,

00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:40.780
your visit

00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:43.340
has already made me happy.

00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:46.460
Your Highness,

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:53.300
the Emperor is concerned about you.

00:33:57.460 --> 00:33:58.660
Tell my brother not to worry.

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:01.060
I am not in any danger here.

00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:14.240
Weren't you going to give me

00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:16.120
a birthday gift I would like?

00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:19.180
I have just decided what I want.

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:22.660
Could you present it
before my old friends?

00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:24.380
I will give you

00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:25.820
whatever you wish.

00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:30.500
I want

00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:32.700
to be your consort.

00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:37.500
What?

00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:39.420
Did I hear it right?

00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:41.220
This...

00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:45.180
Your Highness,

00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:48.360
the Emperor is waiting
for you in Great Sui.

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:49.780
If so,

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:51.340
you will never return.

00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:52.780
Your Highness,

00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:53.720
if the people find out,

00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:54.980
your reputation

00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:55.820
will be ruined.

00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:57.260
Changming,

00:34:57.460 --> 00:34:58.380
do you mean it?

00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:01.750
Even if I am

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:03.500
in the North Qi harem,

00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:06.340
I want to be the most unique

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:07.740
and most distinguished.

00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:09.980
I do not desire to be

00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:11.860
an ordinary consort;

00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:13.900
it is hardly worthy of me.

00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:18.980
Zhao Yue,

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:20.780
do you dare to grant me that?

00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:23.980
This Great Sui woman is so bold.

00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:25.500
- Yes.
- Outrageous!

00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:28.460
You want to be

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:29.780
the Queen of North Qi?

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:34.740
You are even unworthy

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:36.260
to be an ordinary consort.

00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:41.860
Your Majesty,

00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:44.060
choose between the throne

00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:45.300
of North Qi and this woman.

00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:47.940
Mother, is this a threat?

00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:50.260
But you should understand

00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:52.100
that even if my queen

00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:53.820
is not her now,

00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:55.620
it'll be her in the future.

00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:06.260
The position of Queen

00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:07.980
is not something she can demand.

00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:09.660
Your throne

00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:11.700
was not gained

00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:12.540
by your effort alone.

00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:15.500
Do you want

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:16.460
to defy me

00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:17.420
in front

00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:18.780
of everyone here?

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:27.260
I'll respect you

00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:28.900
as you want.

00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:30.820
But you can't stop

00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:33.100
what I want to do.

00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:01.020
Li Changming,
Eldest Princess of Great Sui,

00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:02.640
is willing to forsake her status

00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:04.060
to form a bond with me.

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:06.440
She's diligent in inner affairs,

00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:07.620
graceful, and proper.

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:10.700
I appoint you as my consort

00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:13.340
and grant you the title Mei

00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:15.100
to formalize your rank.

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:28.740
Greet the Consort of Mei now.

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:54.420
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:56.360
If the Emperor were to know,

00:37:56.660 --> 00:37:57.900
he'd fall ill again.

00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:05.820
Chu Yu,

00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:07.100
I'm willing

00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:09.580
to be this consort.

00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:11.980
You must not overthink it.

00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:25.500
Changming.

00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:26.540
Changming!

00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:28.700
Changming!

00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:32.440
The Consort of Mei is unwell.

00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:33.620
Postpone the peace talks.

00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:38.260
Your Highness.

00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:39.860
Your Highness...

00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:45.940
I am weary.

00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:48.820
Mr. Gongsun,

00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:53.340
entertain these envoys on my behalf.

00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:56.060
Yes.

00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:04.220
(Chengtian Hall, Qi)

00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:05.060
Mr. Gongsun,

00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:05.900
what should we do?

00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:07.100
Follow me.

00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:12.420
It makes no sense, Yu.

00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:14.080
I don't understand

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:16.360
why the Eldest Princess
would do such a shocking thing.

00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:17.980
To be honest,

00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:20.940
as a master in romance,

00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:24.700
her action seems sincere.

00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:28.520
I trust the Eldest Princess.

00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:29.920
She is devoted to Great Sui.

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:32.500
There must be a reason for this.

00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:33.700
Did she pretend

00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:37.540
to pass out?

00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:38.860
Impossible.

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:43.340
What about this arrangement?

00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:44.680
Then prepare some more wine.

00:39:45.210 --> 00:39:46.160
How tricky.

00:39:46.810 --> 00:39:47.850
We'll do as you say.

00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:51.300
Mr. Gongsun.

00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:55.660
We have come from afar.

00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:57.740
Thank you for your hospitality today.

00:39:58.100 --> 00:39:58.940
To you.

00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:02.780
We'd never snub envoys.

00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:05.140
You'll surely have a good time.

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:06.300
Cheers.

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:07.180
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:13.820
Changming.

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:16.140
Changming.

00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:24.320
You are finally awake.

00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:26.460
Do you feel any discomfort?

00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:34.020
Now that you've become my consort,

00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:36.620
how could I allow Chu Yu
to take you away?

00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:48.380
Why did you stop?

00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:49.940
Mr. Gongsun.

00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:51.880
You can't hold your liquor.

00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:52.860
Move a little.

00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:54.540
Let me sit here with you.

00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:56.820
Gongsun Lan.

00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:00.260
The Consort of Mei is unwell,

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:02.740
but peace talks are important.

00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:04.540
When shall we start?

00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:06.100
Why rush?

00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:08.700
When you outdrink me,

00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:10.420
we will discuss the peace talks.

00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:11.300
No problem.

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:13.260
He's provoking you.

00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:15.380
Wenchang, I cannot tolerate it.

00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:16.700
Drink with him.

00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:18.380
We cannot lose at drinking.

00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:19.580
Cheers.

00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:28.500
You can really hold your liquor.

00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:33.300
Mr. Gongsun,

00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:34.640
I will drink with you.

00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:36.780
Don't use that cup.

00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:37.820
Let's drink from the pot.

00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:40.280
- No problem.
- Come on.

00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:41.340
Come on.

00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:43.560
The banquet is not over yet.

00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:44.820
Where are you going?

00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:47.700
I've drunk several pots of wine.

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:49.020
What else could I do?

00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:51.620
I need to relieve myself.

00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:55.260
Haven't you heard her?

00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:56.260
Exactly.

00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:57.180
Let her go.

00:41:57.180 --> 00:41:58.020
Exactly.

00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:01.940
Her companion is even sleeping here.

00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:02.880
What are you afraid of?

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:04.340
Ms. Chu,

00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:06.740
please go ahead.

00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:09.740
Thank you, Mr. Gongsun.

00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:12.660
Come on.

00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:13.500
Let's drink.

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:15.480
- Come on.
- Hey, you guys.

00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:16.860
Let's drink together.

00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:17.980
Cheers.

00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:47.700
Your Highness, did you contract

00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:48.780
a cold toxin years ago,

00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:49.980
damaging your health?

00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:51.680
Your menstrual discharge

00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:52.920
is scant and irregular.

00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:54.060
That's correct.

00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:57.420
But earlier, I fainted

00:42:57.740 --> 00:42:59.060
because of a headache.

00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:01.100
Just prescribe me

00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:02.900
a few remedies.

00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:09.560
How is she really doing?

00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:14.700
Your Majesty,

00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:15.540
congratulations!

00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:17.780
The Consort of Mei is pregnant.

00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:18.820
Pregnant?
