[Episode 28]

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.789
Finally got it after waiting for so long.

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:42.640
Yes.

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.070
Their products are simply the best.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.970
This place?

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.920
In my mentor Master Di's book,

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:50.990
he mentioned this
Sifang Cane Shop.

[Sifang Cane Shop]

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.080
It's the only shop in the capital

that specializes in selling

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.400
all kinds of canes.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.470
Young lady, what are you buying?

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.360
Oh, you've got company.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.340
Sir, sorry to disturb your rest.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.050
We'd like to buy a...

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.079
Fengli cane.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:30.370
What cane?

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.680
A Fengli cane.

[Owner of Sifang Cane Shop Song Weng]

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.079
What is that?

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.030
Never heard of it.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.400
Money is not an issue for us.

You have many?

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.420
Those are rare treasures

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.680
that can summon whatever you point at.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.560
I know.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.730
How much for one?

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:58.960
100 coins.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.290
Too expensive?

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.070
I can give you a discount if you buy more.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.320
I can even lower the price for just one.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.370
After all,

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.470
for a beautiful lady like you,

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.420
I should give special treatment.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.710
Wait.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.910
Are your Fengli canes genuine?

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.610
Of course they are.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:18.470
Each one

Stop!

Everything I said is true.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.240
Let me ask you,

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.360
do you know quality when you see it?

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.430
Of course I do.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:48.930

Let me tell you,

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.030
these dozens of Fengli canes I have

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.960
are all genuine.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.970
Each one

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.310
has been urinated on by a Fengli beast.

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.350
It really has the smell of Fengli fluid,

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:19.690
and it's quite strong.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.940
So these are Fengli canes?

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.390
How did you get these Fengli canes?

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.530
That's easy.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:29.680
Just have the Fengli beast

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.360
urinate on them and that's it.

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.120
So you own

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:35.159
Fengli beasts?

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.830
Of course I do.

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.560
How much for a Fengli beast?

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.360
You're from the county office.

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.920
These Fengli beasts are on the
Court of the Imperial Treasury's

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.480
prohibited sales list.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.159
You're testing me

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:59.800
to extort me.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.000
Look at me,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.120
do I look like someone
from the county office?

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.600
I'm not.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.950
I just want to buy a Fengli beast

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.680
to treat my elderly relative's
head ailment.

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.000
Then just buy some Fengli fluid

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.020
for them.

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:15.360
I have some here.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.160
Here, a whole jar of it.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.690
How much do you want?

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.270
But think carefully before you decide.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.390
This one's expensive,

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.020
10,000 coins per tael.

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:41.510
How much?

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:43.830
Your Fengli cane is so cheap.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.520
Why is this one so expensive?

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.960
How can you compare them?

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.430
These few pieces of broken wood

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:49.600
are good for nothing.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.750
All those talk

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.430
about killing beasts and evil
with one point,

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.390
and summoning good things

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:58.159
with another point

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:59.680
are just lies.

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:01.360
What I have here

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.680
is truly something special.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.720
What is rheumatism?

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.350
It's when your body goes numb

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:10.960
and becomes paralyzed.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.130
After using this stuff,

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.800
you'll be able to walk swiftly again.

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.510
So, is 10,000 coins still expensive?

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:22.190
Is it?

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.720
It's so expensive, does anyone buy it?

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:27.560
Whether people buy it or not

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.800
is none of your business. Really.

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:37.480
Yongzhou Prefecture Office
is on the case. Answer truthfully.

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:39.480
I just said

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:41.190
I wasn't from the county office.

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:42.680
I didn't say she wasn't.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.690
Just answer his question truthfully.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.360
Young lady, this is

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:50.230
really a century-old shop.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.630
This shop was opened

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.840
when I was 80 years old.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.560
This year marks exactly 100 years.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.560
You're 180 years old?

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:06.950
I didn't come to hear your tall tales.

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:08.250
Tell me the truth.

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:09.950
What I mean is,

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.770
in the first few decades after opening,

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:15.600
someone did come and pay high prices

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.160
for the Fengli fluid.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.120
Though my shop is in a remote location,

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.300
it was once crowded with customers.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.370
I don't know who

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:24.430
came up with

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.680
a prescription for rheumatism.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.730
How despicable of them

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.960
to cut off my livelihood.

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:33.159
So this jar

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:35.130
has been sealed for over a decade,

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:37.000
and no one has shown any interest.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.200
That's why the urine scent

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:41.300
is so strong.

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:43.370
No, no!

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.159
I mean medicinal fragrance!

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:48.230
You're saying in the past decade or so,

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:50.820
you haven't sold it even once?

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.400
No, never sold it.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.120
Look at all the dust on this jar.

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:05.600
This person is cunning.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.310
It doesn't sound like the truth.

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:07.840
See?

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:09.930
The officer is suspicious of you.

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:11.360
Well, there's no choice then.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.160
We'll have to take you
to Yongzhou Prefecture's

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.500
Judicial Official

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.070
for questioning.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:17.800
No, no!

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:18.950
These old bones of mine

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:20.510
can't handle such trouble.

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.270
I have it!

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:24.430
I've recorded every customer's purchase

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:26.260
in my ledger.

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:27.680
I'll bring it to you right away.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.240
I'll...

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:29.930
I'll get it for you right away.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.909
If you find any important clues,

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.840
don't forget to credit me.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:37.630
Of course.

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:51.390
He escaped.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.750
The situation below is unclear.
We need to be careful.

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:56.360
We can't just

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.750
watch him get away.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.160
Such an impatient temperament.

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:22.960
Are you okay?

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:23.670
I'm fine.

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:26.830
I think he's over there.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.870
What kind of place is this?

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.360
If that old man is really
over 100 years old,

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.560
wouldn't he have fallen apart just now?

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:52.470
Chang'an is vast
and encompasses everything.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.870
It's normal to find extraordinary people

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:55.840
in the city.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.840
According to my mentor's records,

00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.240
the Sifang Cane Shop

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.440
has been open for more than 70 years.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.140
The shopkeeper has long been over
100 years old.

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:06.200
From Master Di's records?

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.260
That must have been over a decade ago.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.180
Could it be that

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:11.800
the shopkeeper is really
some ancient demon?

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:13.870
Stop!

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:14.670
I'll kill you!

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:17.670
Run if you dare!

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.000
Go ahead, run!

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.030
Looking for someone?

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:23.200
I know all of Chang'an's

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.600
most skilled assassins.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.480
I know the cheapest ones too.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.120
Get lost.

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:43.430
Sir.

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:44.910
The House of Sorrow
has a new top courtesan.

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:46.040
Let's go for a drink.

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.000
Young lady, are you here
at the Ghost Market

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:48.910
to look for work?

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:50.480
The House of Sorrow is a good place.

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.870
Many officials and nobles
have visited lately.

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:53.120
They're very generous,

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:54.240
and you have a chance to marry

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.630
into a good family this way.

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:56.160
Get lost.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:00.740
This old man

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.440
escaped to the Ghost Market.

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.430
It'll be hard to find him now.

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.240
Why did he run away?

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:08.340
Should I not have

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.760
scared him with my sword?

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.710
He must have done something illegal

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:14.440
and is afraid of officials.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.170
Perhaps

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:18.770
he really did sell Fengli beasts before.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.360
Does he really have Fengli beasts?

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.280
Of course. If not,

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.030
where did he get those Fengli canes

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:24.690
and fluids?

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:34.230
Being able to uncover

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:36.360
the Wei family's merit-record pillar

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:38.020
must have been heaven's will.

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:40.550
It's also your ancestors' blessing.

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:42.320
That's why they were discovered.

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:42.840
Wei,

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:43.960
I'm late.

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:44.550
Lu,

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:46.320
Miss Pei.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:49.890
Chancellor Cui.

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:51.670
Official Lu.

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:54.900
Since everyone is here,

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.160
let's take our seats.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:59.460
Master Cui of Qinghe,
please take the seat of honor.

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:01.480
You are a minister in the court,

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.440
you should sit in the place of honor.

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.630
We won't consider official ranks today.

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:07.860
You should have the seat of honor.

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:09.780
I'll just sit beside you.

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:11.840
Gentlemen,

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:13.480
let's offer this seat

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:14.620
to Official Lu.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:15.420
This...

00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:17.510
This isn't appropriate.

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:18.570
No need to decline.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.390
As a member of the Lu family of Fanyang,

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:22.270
it's most fitting for you to sit there.

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:23.210
It's fitting.

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:24.960
Yes, it's fitting.

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:25.920
Fitting.

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:29.440
I'll respectfully comply.

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:32.400
Miss Pei came with Lu,

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.720
so she should sit next to him.

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:39.950
Everyone, please be seated.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:40.670
Alright.

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:41.270
This way.

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:41.750
Please.

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:42.320
Please.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.140
Please.

00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:50.790
Today, Wei Tao of the capital
is hosting a family banquet.

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:52.850
Everyone present, regardless of age

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:53.790
or gender,

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:55.750
is from a noble family.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.840
Let me introduce everyone in turn.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:58.900
-This...
-Wei Tao.

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:02.510
Just have everyone introduce themselves.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.200
As for me,

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:07.200
you may call me

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:10.150
Master Cui of Qinghe.

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:19.480
Lu Lingfeng of Fanyang.

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:25.440
Cui Shi of Boling.

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:32.750
Pei Xijun of Hedong.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.270
Wang Dezhao of Taiyuan.

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:41.000
Zheng Ying of Xingyang.

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:43.930
Wang Boyu of Langya.

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.150
Li Shiyue of Zhaojun.

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:48.000
Yang Xuan of Hongnong.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.270
Liu Gongda of Hedong.

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:51.860
Xiao Bang of Lanling.

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:53.440
Gao Tai of Bohai.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:56.120
Everyone,

00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:57.590
please enjoy.

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:11.120
Madam, they've started the banquet.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:13.440
When should we invite the guests
to view the merit-record pillar?

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.570
I'll go prepare now.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:16.840
The merit-record pillar...

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:20.000
Jia, you look especially beautiful today.

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:21.930
Drink this tea.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.650
You'll look more beautiful with each sip.

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:26.740
Have her drink the tea.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.600
Make sure she finishes it all.

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:29.330
Understood.

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:34.630
Miss, please drink your tea.

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:46.350
The merit-record pillar...

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:51.520
Our Wei family's merit-record pillar

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:55.550
reach to the clouds!

00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:58.920
[Wei family of Jingzhao, Wei Jia]

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.880
After several rounds of drinks,

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.820
I'd like to say a few words.

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:12.850
Today, you are our most honored guest.

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:15.070
We'd like to hear your insights.

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:17.800
In the Later Han Dynasty,
the great scholars,

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:19.000
Yuan An of Runan,

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:20.720
and Yang Zhen of Hongnong

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:23.670
studied classics diligently
when out of the office,

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:26.000
and feared no power when in court.

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:29.000
The prestigious families of Runan
and Hongnong

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.400
thus became renowned throughout the land.

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:35.320
For four generations after,

00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:37.240
they served as pillars of the state.

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.630
During the Three Kingdoms period,

00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:40.230
the Wei, Shu, and Wu Kingdoms

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.720
had rulers from humble origins.

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.370
But the officials who held real power,

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:49.000
like Sima Yi, Zhuge Liang, and Lu Xun,

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:52.150
all hailed from prestigious families.

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:55.710
It was said that
the Cui and Lu families were inseparable.

00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:58.600
Lu Lingfeng, please continue.

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:04.230
Chen Qun of Yingchuan

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:05.680
established the

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.770
Nine-Rank Official System in Wei.

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:09.440
The Sima family of Henei

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:11.610
then unified the Three Kingdoms.

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:21.990
Official Lu, you're too kind.

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:23.960
Well, allow me.

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:30.550
During the Eastern Jin,

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:33.510
the Wang and Ma families shared power.

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:37.950
The Wang, Xie, Yuan, and Xiao families
represented the South,

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.160
while the North had
the Cui, Lu, Zheng, and Wang families.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.840
Xie An achieved victory at Fei River,

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:46.750
and Cui Hao unified the North.

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:50.630
So many talents of that time

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.670
were the glory of our noble families.

00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:59.270
But by the early Sui Dynasty,

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:02.300
they abolished
the Nine-Rank Official System

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:04.790
and established the imperial examination.

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:07.650
Sons of noble families
seeking official positions

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:09.670
had to take these examinations.

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:11.880
They left their hometowns,

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.880
causing their ancestral lands
to fall into ruin.

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:16.230
With family members scattered

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:17.550
and genealogical records lost,

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:18.720
the glory was gone.

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:21.450
Therefore,

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.930
today's banquet is of great significance.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:29.110
We view the Wei family's
merit-record pillar

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.980
to remind us of our ancestors' glory,

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:34.450
and remind future generations

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.580
not to sink into decline.

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.000
Well said!

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:41.120
The dynasty of the Li family from Longxi

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.720
was fortunate to have you

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.590
as their chancellor.

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:47.350
Master Cui, you're too kind.

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:49.450
Master Cui,

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:52.050
best not let those words spread.

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:55.200
Sheriff Wei,

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:58.440
can we see your family's newly unearthed

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:00.220
merit-record pillar now?

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:01.110
Of course.

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:02.390
Servants,

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:04.040
send for my wife.

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:21.750
Then I invite Master Cui, Chancellor Cui,

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:23.990
and Brother Lu

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:26.310
to unveil the merit-record pillars.

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:26.960
No.

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:30.410
The family treasure
of the Wei family of Jingzhao

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:33.960
should be unveiled by you, Wei Tao.

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:37.040
Very well.

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:46.110
Then I invite my wife to join me.

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:01.510
Look!

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:03.760
This is the glory of the Wei family!

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:11.440
The Wei and Du families from the South
have been close for generations.

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:14.790
Sheriff Wei, I heard your wife

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:16.740
is from the Du family of Jingzhao.

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:22.140
Thank you all for honoring us
with your presence

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:24.160
[Wei Tao's wife, Ju Niang]

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:25.310
to witness

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:27.140
our Wei family treasure together.

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:28.370
This is also the honor

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.030
of the Wei family of Jingzhao.

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:33.350
My husband and I thank you all.

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:40.160
To have a merit-record pillar unearthed

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.820
is truly fortunate!

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:44.830
Is this a merit-record pillar
from the Wei-Jin period?

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:47.030
It's at least a relic
from the Northern Dynasties.

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:48.480
Miss Pei has a discerning eye.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.810
It is indeed from the Northern Dynasties.

00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:56.790
Wonderful!

00:19:58.270 --> 00:19:59.200
It's just a pity

00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:01.650
that the character 'Wei' is missing.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.160
Have you gone to the excavation site

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:05.360
to search thoroughly

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:06.350
and dig around?

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:08.220
We haven't found it yet.

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:09.430
But I believe

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:12.890
what belongs to the Wei family
will eventually return.

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:15.640
Well said.

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:19.420
County Sheriff Wei,
I've heard your wife is virtuous

00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:21.240
and very knowledgeable.

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:22.880
Why not invite her

00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:25.200
to read what's written
on this merit-record pillar

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.510
for all of us to hear?

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:34.930
Chancellor Cui,

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:37.410
I dare not follow your command.

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:40.030
This pillar is the Wei family's treasure.

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:42.310
The inscription
should be read by my husband

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:43.640
to all of you gentlemen.

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:47.350
Truly a lady from a noble family

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:49.680
with sound mannerisms and reasoning.

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:50.790
Wei Tao.

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:00.410
The Wei family of ministers

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:03.240
was the most prominent clan
of the three regions.

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:04.600
Our ancestor, Wei Meng,

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:07.000
lived for generations in Qi and Lu.

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:09.870
He studied Zhou rituals
and the Book of Documents,

00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:11.630
and passed down Lu's poetry.

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:13.720
Our family's scholarly tradition

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.920
was renowned throughout the land.

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.780
When Wei Xian became chancellor,

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:19.240
he assisted Emperors Zhao and Xuan

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:21.000
and was granted
the title of Marquis of Fuyang.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.600
Later, he moved to Chang'an.

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:25.510
The family nurtured generations
of high officials and marquises

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:29.040
in the Han and Wei-Jin period,
producing many notable figures.

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:31.350
During the
Southern and Northern Dynasties,

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:33.020
in the South there was Wei Rui,

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:35.310
and in the North there was Wei Xiaokuan.

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:37.310
They were both pillars of the state.

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:40.820
From the west of Xiao Mountain

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.310
to the lands within Hangu Pass,

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:45.030
it was the most prominent clan,
nurturing ministers for generations.

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:46.290
Among noble families,

00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:49.680
none surpassed the Wei clan.

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:53.510
Excellent!

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:57.750
Let us drink three cups

00:21:57.790 --> 00:21:59.550
to honor the Wei ancestors.

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:00.750
Excellent!

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:02.000
Let's drink heartily!

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:02.640
My wife,

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:05.480
join me in paying respects to our guests.

00:22:07.790 --> 00:22:08.390
Servants!

00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:10.480
Bring wine!

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:15.960
Wei.

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:18.350
Congratulations, Wei.

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:19.310
Thank you.

00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:21.480
You are the daughter of Vice Minister Pei,

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:22.580
Xijun, aren't you?

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:24.650
Before I was married,

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:26.750
during spring outings by the Qu River,

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:28.270
we played polo together.

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:32.270
I remember now.

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:33.720
I was still young then.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:34.520
Juniang,

00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:36.480
you were outstanding on the polo field.

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:37.880
It's wonderful to meet again.

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:39.540
Let's visit each other often.

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:40.380
Certainly.

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:42.500
-Come on.
-Please.

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:43.160
Please.

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.660
The merit-record pillars

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:46.480
placed at the family gate

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:50.030
record the merits of ancestors.

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:53.280
The left pillar is called "Fa,"

00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:56.130
and the right pillar is called "Yue."

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:58.970
Therefore, "Fayue" is often used

00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:02.250
to refer to noble families.

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:16.600
I was born into
the Wei family of Jingzhao.

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:21.160
I am a lady from a noble family.

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:25.970
I cannot marry a merchant.

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.050
I cannot marry a merchant.

00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:29.910
I shouldn’t marry a businessman!

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:34.450
Sister-in-law.

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:35.890
Jia...

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.550
I shouldn’t marry a businessman.

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:40.400
-I shouldn’t marry a businessman.
-I’m sorry. My sister is still sick.

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:41.460
Please forgive us.

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:43.430
Servants, take her back.

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:44.440
No!

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.780
The merit-record pillar is here.

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:50.770
I've disgraced the Wei family.

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:53.940
I've disgraced the Wei family!

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:56.150
I should kill myself!

00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:58.860
Such madness.

00:23:59.070 --> 00:23:59.880
Take her back immediately!

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:01.880
I am from the Wei family of Jingzhao.

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:03.660
I am a woman of noble birth.

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:05.980
-I shouldn’t marry a businessman.
-Jia!

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:09.030
Sister-in-law, I was wrong.

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:12.340
Official Lu.

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:15.320
Let me toast you specially.

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:18.070
Chancellor Cui,
I should be the one toasting you.

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:19.070
It's all the same.

00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:27.510
The wind is gentle
and the moon is bright today.

00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:29.550
Join me for a walk in the courtyard.

00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:31.880
Alright.

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:35.790
Official Lu, how was the banquet?

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:37.400
I'm glad

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:39.880
to have attended the banquet tonight.

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:42.070
I feel the same way.

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:45.580
Wei Tao's sudden invitation

00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:46.890
was my suggestion.

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:49.110
Surprised?

00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:52.640
It is somewhat unexpected.

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:58.110
The Wei family's discovery
of their merit-record pillar

00:24:58.110 --> 00:25:00.110
is not just the Wei family's affair.

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:02.960
It's also a grand event for Chang'an,

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:04.000
and moreover,

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:07.200
a celebration for all noble families
of the Tang Empire.

00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:08.010
However,

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:10.120
families like Wei and Du,

00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:12.270
compared to our Cui and Lu families,

00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:14.240
still fall short.

00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:15.680
You know this

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:17.680
very well.

00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:20.930
People say Cui and Lu

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.800
are the most prestigious families
of our time.

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:25.830
Cui and Lu.

00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:28.200
Where there's Lu, there's Cui,

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.920
and vice versa.

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:33.200
I've had a few drinks today,

00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:35.110
and I have some heartfelt words.

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.210
Would you like to hear them?

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:39.640
Please speak freely, Chancellor Cui.

00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:40.640
Miss!

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.960
Let go of me! I won't!

00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:49.240
Xijun, I've troubled you.

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:52.310
Not at all.

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:54.640
I met Miss Wei

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:56.370
when I was young, too.

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:57.550
Yes.

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:00.620
She was there that spring day
by the Qu River.

00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:03.260
What illness does she have now?

00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:06.390
It's what common people call madness.

00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:08.110
Have you consulted a doctor?

00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:09.110
Of course we have.

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:10.920
We even got medicine prescribed.

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:12.200
But it barely helps.

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:14.040
She can't handle any shock.

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:16.720
Strong emotions of any kind affect her.

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:21.680
I have a friend.

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:23.510
He's a disciple
of the Medicine King, Sun Simiao.

00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:24.440
Back in Luoyang,

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:26.640
he cured the princess
of the human-faced flower poison.

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:27.620
If you trust me,

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:29.200
I can invite him another day

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:30.540
to treat Miss Wei Jia.

00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:33.510
That would be wonderful.

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:35.510
On behalf of my sister,

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:37.170
I thank you in advance, Xijun.

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:38.400
You're too kind.

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:40.640
In today's Chang'an,

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:42.880
there's talk of Su and Lu.

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:44.160
Do you know about it?

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:47.940
That person is very cunning.

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:50.160
He always uses the empire

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:52.590
and Di Renjie as a front to control you,

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:55.310
all to achieve his personal gain.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.510
You must be careful.

00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:00.640
Chancellor Cui, you may have some

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:02.700
misunderstandings about Su Wuming.

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:05.790
He always gives people

00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:08.510
the impression of being indifferent
to fame and fortune.

00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:09.550
But in reality,

00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:12.040
his heart is full of hypocrisy.

00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:15.230
He's not the same kind of person
as our families,

00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:17.010
who are educated in classics.

00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:19.130
You and I

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:21.470
are elite nobles.

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.640
We must be true to our inner ideals.

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:27.960
In my eyes,

00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:31.110
the emperor is not important.

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:33.350
You should know

00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:35.230
that the current emperor

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:37.310
was once my neighbor.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.110
If I had wanted,

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:42.030
when the emperor ascended the throne,

00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:43.760
I could have become a new noble.

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:47.030
I didn't do that.

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:48.690
Because

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:52.030
I am not the villain people say I am,

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.540
nor have I attached myself to the princess

00:27:54.790 --> 00:27:56.500
to gain power for myself.

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:03.480
My ideal is to be like Cui Hao,

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:07.110
the great minister of Northern Wei,

00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:08.440
and establish

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:10.000
a court where scholarship

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.350
and nobility are united.

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:11.950
Of course,

00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:14.010
he ultimately failed.

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:15.900
But I'm still striving for it.

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:17.920
Once successful,

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:20.000
His Majesty will merely be a figurehead.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.270
While the affairs of state

00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:23.070
will be managed by us nobles.

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:25.350
Just like in the Eastern Jin Dynasty.

00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:26.000
By then,

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:28.000
the talented men from our
Cui, Lu, Zheng, and Wang families

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.460
can take turns governing.

00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:31.200
Our families

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:33.590
have held high positions for centuries.

00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:35.030
We certainly know better than His Majesty

00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:36.640
how to govern the country

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:38.490
and bring peace to the people.

00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:44.400
Scholarship

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:49.590
and nobility united in one court.

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:50.520
That's right.

00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:52.540
What makes nobility precious?

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:53.510
First,

00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:56.790
it's the unbroken tradition
of family learning.

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:00.990
Just like our families.

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:07.040
It brings me comfort

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:09.370
that you came to the banquet today.

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:13.270
Since the Proscription
of the Partisan Families in Eastern Han,

00:29:13.270 --> 00:29:14.540
for these 500 years,

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:16.230
the fate of all noble families

00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:17.400
has been tied together.

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:19.510
We should have been of one mind long ago.

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:20.440
Don't you agree?

00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:23.560
What I've told you tonight

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:25.310
are all words from the bottom of my heart.

00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:26.270
In my heart,

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.550
Cui and Lu outweigh everything else,

00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:31.150
including the Tang Emperor,

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:33.550
and even the princess
I've always followed,

00:29:33.550 --> 00:29:35.160
who holds great power.

00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:37.720
Dynasties may change,

00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:40.560
but those enjoying good reputations

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:41.440
are not them.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.750
It's we who will never fall

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:46.770
on the imperial path.

00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:50.110
Isn't that so?

00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:53.650
Many of your words

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:55.480
are greatly agreeable wth me.

00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:57.180
However,

00:29:58.110 --> 00:29:59.880
why are you telling me all this?

00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:03.880
You should know His Majesty's character.

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:06.160
He's wary of people like us.

00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:08.110
What he wants

00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:10.120
is to hold absolute power

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:12.590
and cast us nobles aside.

00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:15.170
But if the princess replaces him,

00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:17.110
she might delegate power to us.

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:18.720
Moreover,

00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:20.960
the princess is your birth mother.

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:22.490
Whether from filial duty

00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:24.550
or from the perspective

00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:25.830
of noble families' ideals,

00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:27.480
you should make a choice.

00:30:28.550 --> 00:30:30.280
As for which side to stand with,

00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:32.790
you should know in your heart.

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:37.350
A mere Judicial Official title

00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:39.680
is too humble
for the Lu family of Fanyang.

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:40.640
To become a general or chancellor

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:41.830
and govern the nation
on behalf of His Majesty,

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:43.690
that is your future, Lu Lingfeng.

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:47.640
The master of this house, Wei Tao,

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:50.270
though now only a county sheriff,

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:53.230
comes from a noble background.

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:54.280
In the future,

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:57.970
he will be someone we can use.

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:07.390
[Wei Mansion]

00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:19.530
Wei, are you all right?

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:25.400
I'm fine.

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:28.240
Sorry, I drank too much today.

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:32.300
Lu, Miss Pei.

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:34.000
It's my honor to have you both

00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:35.590
visit my humble home.

00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:37.440
I'm truly grateful.

00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:39.470
You're too kind, Wei.

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:41.220
It's an honor to view

00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:42.920
the Wei family's merit-record pillar

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:44.440
and recall the glory
of the noble families.

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:45.040
Farewell.

00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:45.910
Farewell.

00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:49.110
Farewell.

00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:03.640
Dragging me out
in the middle of the night...

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:05.380
I'm Boss Fei now,

00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:07.400
and the Chicken Master of Tang.

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:08.590
How can we come to the Ghost Market,

00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:09.830
such a dark place?

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:11.310
Stop rambling.

00:32:12.510 --> 00:32:14.770
According to my mentor Master Di's book,

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:16.480
that old shop owner

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:17.490
is surnamed Song.

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:19.280
He claims to be 180 years old.

00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:20.410
I don't believe it.

00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:23.410
But if that shop has been open
for 100 years,

00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:25.730
then he must be at least 120.

00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:29.520
And that cane shop is connected
to the Ghost Market

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.030
via a secret passage.

00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:34.750
You've been around the Ghost Market
for decades,

00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:36.070
haven't you heard about it?

00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:37.400
Actually, no.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.350
But there are a few old monsters

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.590
who are over 100 years old.

00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:45.880
They mostly hang around
the Earth God Temple.

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:48.590
The Ghost Market
has an Earth God Temple?

00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:50.030
Sure enough, bringing Mr. Fei along

00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:51.660
will show us where to look.

00:32:52.030 --> 00:32:53.310
Of course.

00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:57.970
Wait, that's not right.

00:32:58.830 --> 00:33:00.220
In the Ghost Market,

00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:02.510
at this hour and this location,

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:05.070
it should be bustling with life.

00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:08.200
I'll go ask around.

00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:09.130
Wait here,

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:10.420
and don't mess around.

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:12.570
Especially you.

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:15.880
Even if you're a secret agent
of Yongzhou Prefecture,

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:17.540
you can't just draw your sword

00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:18.830
whenever you want.

00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:23.070
Yes, I'll listen to you, Mr. Fei.

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:31.310
I must catch that shop owner.

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:32.960
He got away

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.130
right under my nose.

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:35.600
It really infuriates me.

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:39.070
You're still too young.

00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:40.880
Such a temper.

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:44.680
Good to be young.

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:52.620
The Ghost Market nowadays

00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:55.160
is full of strange happenings.

00:33:55.270 --> 00:33:56.070
What's wrong?

00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:58.310
The Ghost Market now even has

00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:59.570
a Zoroastrian temple.

00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:01.350
A Zoroastrian temple?

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:02.060
See?

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:04.040
It's stealing all the attention

00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:05.350
from the Earth God Temple.

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:06.750
I heard that in recent days,

00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:08.610
it's been very lively over there.

00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:10.150
Why don't I

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:12.409
take you there to check it out?

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:14.090
Sounds good.

00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:15.320
Let's go.

00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:16.560
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

00:34:16.590 --> 00:34:18.110
Why are you elbow-locking me again?

00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:18.840
Just behave.

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:26.190
Where to? It's here.

00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:29.940
I only found these two.

00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:30.840
Maybe

00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:33.040
you shouldn't go, Yingtao.

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:36.000
Not bad, Fei.

00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:37.120
Of course.

00:34:37.630 --> 00:34:38.900
This Ghost Market is

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.070
my kingdom, Fei Yingjun's domain!

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:44.080
Mr. Fei, you're so capable,

00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:45.480
why don't you help me

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:47.070
find the shop owner?

00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:49.969
You think I can't find him?

00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:53.150
Go on in.

00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:00.550
This reverse psychology on Fei

00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:01.880
really works.

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:03.290
Let's go.

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:29.630
What's wrong?

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:31.840
Why are you so sad?

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:34.280
My father has been missing for days.

00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:36.480
No sign of him, dead or alive.

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:37.820
How can I not be sad?

00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:41.090
What about you?

00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:46.230
I... I'm here looking for my brother.

00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:48.800
Where does your brother do business?

00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:51.630
In the West Market. He sells spices.

00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:55.130
Is your father also a merchant?

00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:57.070
Father owns the largest

00:35:57.110 --> 00:35:59.110
fabric business in the East Market.

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:01.280
I've already prayed to the
Zoroastrian god

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:02.960
at the Buzheng District for protection.

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:04.820
But it seems completely useless,

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:06.840
so I came to the Ghost Market

00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:09.450
to seek divine protection again.

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:48.000
Shi Qiansui.

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:49.610
Who's there?

00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:01.360
Su Wuming pays his respects
to the High Priest.

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:03.070
Su Wuming?

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:04.800
Didn't we just meet today

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:06.630
at the Buzheng District?

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:07.550
Did you

00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:08.950
forget about me already?

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:10.190
You followed me?

00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:11.360
Not at all.

00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:13.590
It's just a coincidence.

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:16.880
High Priest,
you truly deserve your title as

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.600
the leader of the An Society.

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:20.550
Not only are you
the biggest spice merchant

00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:22.400
in both East and West Markets,

00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:24.840
you also receive a salary from the court,

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:26.660
and you even managed to build

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:30.210
a Xian temple here in the Ghost Market
to collect money.

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:31.670
You're truly impressive.

00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:33.670
I didn't build this temple.

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:36.320
The merchants of the Ghost Market

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:37.760
built it on their own initiative.

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:38.760
I came today

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:40.260
not to collect money,

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:41.920
but to pray sincerely.

00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:44.190
They say in the Ghost Market,

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:46.320
one can get closer
to the spirits of the dead.

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:47.580
And all these proceeds

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:49.320
will be donated to the An Society

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:51.190
to take care of the funeral arrangements

00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:52.880
for those merchants who died tragically.

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:54.150
So you're saying,

00:37:54.590 --> 00:37:57.280
besides Hua Fu, Ma Kui,

00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:58.710
and He Qian,

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:01.840
other merchants have died too?

00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:08.920
Here, take a look for yourself.

00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:13.360
[Qin Zhiyuan, Jewelry Merchant]
[Zhao Shisi, Silk Merchant]

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:18.290
There are actually 6 people?

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:19.110
Yes.

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:21.850
They all disappeared
within the last 10 days.

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:24.110
The High Priest's Office
compiled this list.

00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:25.500
Besides their names,

00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:27.710
it also shows their occupations,

00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:30.290
approximate time of disappearance,

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:33.330
and the district they were

00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:34.800
last seen in.

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:39.250
Why didn't you mention this

00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:40.760
at the Buzheng District today?

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:41.960
That guy from the Lu family of Fanyang,

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:43.150
I don't trust him.

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:44.620
What's wrong with him?

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:46.620
At the end of the day, those nobles

00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:48.590
despise us merchants.

00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:58.000
Where has Mr. Fei

00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:58.840
gone?

00:38:59.190 --> 00:39:00.280
The Ghost Market is so big.

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:01.480
Where should we look?

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:06.190
Did you bring
the map of Chang'an districts?

00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:06.800
Yes, I did.

00:39:16.070 --> 00:39:17.730
What would you two like to eat?

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:19.780
Just borrowing your lamp.

00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:26.400
Xingdao, Anren, Anyi.

00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:29.320
Shanhe, Da'an, Chonghua.

00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:36.210
Hua Fu died in Fengle District.

00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:38.750
[Fengle District]

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:41.020
Ma Kui died in Jinggong District.

00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:43.360
[Jinggong District]

00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:46.350
He Qian died in Yanzuo District.

00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:48.490
[Yanzuo District]

00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:56.170
[Imperial City] [Fengle District]
[Jinggong District]
[Yanzuo District] [Tongji District]

00:39:57.930 --> 00:40:02.290
[West Market] [Yanping Gate]

00:40:02.290 --> 00:40:05.040
[East Market] [Yanxing Gate]

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:09.190
[Imperial City] [Mingde Gate]

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:14.720
[Anbei Gate] [Mingde Gate] [Qixia Gate]

00:40:14.830 --> 00:40:18.450
[Tongji District]

00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:19.810
[Imperial City]

00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:24.240
[Noble]

00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:31.320
Yingtao, Tongji District, now.

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:33.730
I've already sent Liu, Jia, and Luo

00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:36.480
to search for bodies
in the other districts on the map.

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:37.080
Su Wuming.

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:39.060
You've become quite impressive.

00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:40.200
Chang'an is so vast,

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:43.030
yet you somehow know
where murders have occurred.

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:45.000
We've been running for hours.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.400
Say something, will you?

00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:48.000
I'm getting bored.

00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:56.510
It's past curfew.
Who goes there in the night?

00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:58.970
We're from the Yongzhou Prefecture Office.

00:40:59.230 --> 00:41:00.360
Tonight's password,

00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:01.110
Chentaoxie.

00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:03.110
Xiangji Temple.

00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:08.320
So it's Mr. Su.

00:41:10.110 --> 00:41:11.020
You know me?

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:12.630
During the Black Tea case investigation,

00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:14.280
I was a minor soldier under the General.

00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:15.280
I had the honor to participate,

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:16.480
and now I'm a captain.

00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:19.130
So you're an old acquaintance.

00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:21.280
You should continue your patrol.

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:22.710
I need to continue my investigation.

00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:24.550
So you're investigating another case.

00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:25.880
Do you need assistance?

00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:27.550
No, no need.

00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:29.480
Farewell.

00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:30.960
Su Wuming.

00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:31.960
Horses.

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:36.120
Right, I completely forgot about that.

00:41:37.110 --> 00:41:38.920
Could I borrow two horses?
