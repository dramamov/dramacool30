00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.270
How did it come to this?

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.600
My whole goal was...

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.530
to make Shizuma fall for me.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.440
Minato...

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.500
I'm in love with you.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.920
All you had to do was hold me.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.630
It doesn't matter if there are feelings involved.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.540
Let's not overthink it and just have fun.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.660
I won't ask for any commitment.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.160
Shizuma...

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.450
I can't do that.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.510
To me, you're already...

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.200
not someone I can just fool around with anymore.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.520
What are you talking about?

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.750
This isn't funny.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.980
I don't think we can go back to that night.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.680
But if...

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.170
If we could do it over...

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.340
I don't want it to be just getting caught up
in the moment like that time.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.150
I want us to hold each other knowing
that we're truly in love.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:35.910
Huh?

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.510
What are you talking about?

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.430
I was just trying to get my revenge.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.510
A guy like him...

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.720
There's no way I could take him seriously.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:50.940
Because I want to cherish you.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.550
I'll sleep in the other room.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:01.710
Good night.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:02.900
Minato.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.880
Oh, for crying out loud.

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:11.580
How many more times am I gonna
let him wrap me around his finger?

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.880
I can't believe he actually fell for me...

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.570
He was way too easy.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.590
Wait.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.450
I'm one to talk.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.000
I talked a big game about getting revenge,

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.420
but now I'm the one catching feelings?

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.050
No.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.800
I haven't.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.380
Calm down.

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:52.820
If I just stay calm,

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.190
I don't have any feelings for Shizuma.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.200
I'm fine.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.410
Totally fine.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.300
"Therapy Game"

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.200
(Episode 4)

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.150
Huh?

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:48.930
Shizuma.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.150
Oh.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.320
There you are.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:56.820
Morning.

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.230
You were in the shower forever.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.070
I got tired of waiting.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.060
That was so...

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.940
- Not okay!
- Hey.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.380
- You... you idiot!
- What's gotten into you?

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.920
- You're an idiot, an idiot!
- What... are you in elementary school?

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:21.830
Idiot, idiot.

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.940
Yeah, I'm childish. So what?

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:30.740
You're so annoying...

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:38.230
What?

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.210
Nothing.

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.870
- I was just thinking it's good to see you're back to your usual self.
- Huh?

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.450
After I confessed so suddenly,

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.540
I thought you might have run off
in the middle of the night.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.020
I was a little worried.

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:56.510
I'm...

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.280
a really horrible person.

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:02.740
You're going to regret this.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.080
I think you're...

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.470
a really great person.

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.340
How so?

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.150
Because...

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:14.920
Even though I got blackout drunk

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:16.680
and hurt you,

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:19.350
you still stayed by my side

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.000
and helped me get over my broken heart.

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:33.280
Your kindness

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:35.290
is what saved me.

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:38.770
That's...

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.260
That was because I wanted revenge.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.720
I wanted to hurt you even more.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.480
You've got it all wrong.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.240
I'm...

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.160
not the good person you think I am.

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.310
Your smile is cute.

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:03.390
Huh?

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.690
Your pouting face is cute too.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.950
And I kind of like how blunt you are.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.090
The way you got all excited like a kid
at the amusement park was also really cute.

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.240
Also, how you calm down when I pat your head,

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:18.990
like a cat. It makes my heart skip a beat.

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.150
Oh, but you are a little violent.

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:24.980
I'd really appreciate it if you'd be a little more gentle.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.830
So what's your point?

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:31.630
So,

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:33.540
even if you don't see it yourself,

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.980
I can see all the good things about you.

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:38.890
Which means,

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.440
you're a good person.

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:43.930
Why?

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.920
Why do you trust me so much?

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.650
You don't even know why I approached you.

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:54.460
You're such an idiot...

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:02.460
I'm sorry...

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:05.700
That's enough. I have to stop.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.360
This whole revenge thing...

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:11.690
I don't want to hurt Shizuma.

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:14.870
I don't want to leave him.

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:20.010
Um...

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:21.730
Shizuma.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:25.880
I...

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:35.840
(You'd better bring us back some souvenirs!)
(I want sweets.)

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.400
(Oh, the mamasan wants you to get rice crackers.)
(And White Tiger Pie Sticks, a box for each person~)

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:41.800
Oh...

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:43.350
Jeez.

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.240
Seriously, who's been telling everyone?

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:50.690
Everyone's asking me to buy them sweets.

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:53.410
But,

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:54.800
you still bought them anyway.

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:57.800
Well, they do take care of me.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:00.100
Oh.

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:02.840
By the way, you were about to say something earlier.

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:04.690
Oh, right.

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:06.080
What was it?

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.740
I'll tell you properly some other time.

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:25.100
The view is beautiful.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.040
Do you know where this is?

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:31.060
It looks a lot like where I lived as a kid.

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:33.070
Oh?

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.300
Is it a famous tourist spot?

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:39.580
I don't remember.

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:43.220
After I came to my grandma's place here in the fifth grade,

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:44.760
I never went back.

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:47.920
The memories have all become a blur.

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:50.920
I see.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.880
I can barely even remember the house I used to live in.

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:01.780
You should go visit sometime.

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:04.970
Going there might bring back a lot of memories.

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:07.870
You're right.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.870
I wish I could.

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:13.630
It's impossible.

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:16.650
I can't go near that town.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.720
Shizuma.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:25.880
I'm hungry.

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:27.600
Let's get something to eat before we head back.

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:29.490
Okay.

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:38.530
I'm stuffed.

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:40.290
Yeah.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.440
Oh.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.100
You can drop me off here.

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:48.520
There's somewhere I want to stop by before I go home.

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:51.850
Thanks for walking me.

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:53.790
Yeah.

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:58.450
When are you taking those to the bar?

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.440
I'm actually going tomorrow.

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:02.860
Thanks.

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:04.550
I see.

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:10.520
Bye...

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:14.690
Bye...

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:21.580
- Minato.
- Shizuma.

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:23.060
Oh, sorry.

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:24.790
You go first.

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:26.780
Okay, I'll go.

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:28.830
Um...

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:31.730
Can I ask you out again?

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.120
Huh?

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:35.610
I want to thank you for
spending these last two days with me.

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:39.080
Is that okay?

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.080
I don't mind.

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:47.450
Thank you.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.200
Great.

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:54.200
Oh, so what were you going to say?

00:10:57.850 --> 00:10:58.850
Oh.

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:00.180
It's nothing.

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:02.220
I just wanted to say good night.

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:04.970
Yeah.

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:06.220
Good night.

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:07.900
See you.

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:09.510
Ah...

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:10.920
Goodbye.

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:18.890
In the end...

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:20.570
I still couldn't say it.

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:38.470
- Bro.
- Hmm?

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:41.580
What's with all the sighing?

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:45.900
Nothing... I just can't get him out of my head.

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:48.170
The person you said you liked,

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:50.330
that's who you went to the amusement park with, right?

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:52.230
Yeah.

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:53.650
We had a lot of fun,

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:56.970
but whenever I think about it,

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:01.880
it just hurts right here.

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:02.400
Huh?

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:05.260
- You, bro?
- It's weird, huh?

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:06.610
Not really...

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:08.410
I think it's perfectly normal.

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:09.740
But you, bro...

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.210
You always wait for someone to
confess to you before you start dating.

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:13.800
I've never seen you be the one to fall for someone first.

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:18.030
That's true.

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:20.260
Even I'm surprised at myself.

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:24.420
Why don't you plan our next date?

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:26.400
That's your strong suit, isn't it?

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:29.550
That's true.

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:32.410
Yeah.

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:33.730
You're right.

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:35.520
- I'll think of something.
- Okay.

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:38.900
- Okay!
- I'm home.

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:41.520
- You're back.
- Welcome home.

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.740
I'm so tired.

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:47.970
I vaccinated a Siberian tiger today.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:49.360
Huh?

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:50.720
Sho-chan, are you heading out?

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:51.810
What about dinner?

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:53.570
Oh, I'll eat later.

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:55.910
I'm just meeting up with a friend.

00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:58.980
Don't be out too late.

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:02.270
Ah, he's messaging me.

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:03.790
Okay, I'm off then.

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:05.920
Itsuki-san.

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:07.450
I was just heading out.

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:10.570
Oh, no problem. I'll be right there.

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:15.100
That Itsuki person...

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:17.620
- Is he just a friend?
- Hmm?

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:19.210
No.

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:20.990
He seemed especially happy.

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:23.480
Isn't Sho-chan always like that?

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:25.700
That's true.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.190
- That's just how he is.
- Yeah.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.300

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.390
Shizuma, your internship starts soon, doesn't it?

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:36.760
Yeah.

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:37.830
It does.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:41.030
You should have some fun before you get busy.

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:05.490
Minato.

00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:08.040
What would be a fun place to go?

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:17.310
Delicious.

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:19.350
I'm so glad.

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:23.810
Your brother...

00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:25.260
Sounds like it's going well for him.

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:27.580
I hope so.

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:30.020
I don't know what the other person's like...

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:32.720
but I want my brother to be happy, too.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.530
That's sweet of you.

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:38.660
You think so?

00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:40.010
Yeah.

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:41.950
You're a very kind person.

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:48.480
Heh heh.

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:54.960
Shohei, are you free on Friday?

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:57.750
I happen to have the day off.

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:00.170
If you're up for it,
would you like to go on a date?

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:01.840
Really?

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:03.350
I'd love to go on a date.

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:04.580
In that case...

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:08.060
I just got some movie tickets.
Want to go together?

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:09.400
We can grab dinner afterward.

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:10.250
Yeah!

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:11.860
Of course, I'd love to.

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:14.030
Yes, I'll definitely go.

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.590
Wow, I'm so excited. What movie is it?

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:18.260
I can't wait.

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:19.740
Oh.

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:22.380
I wonder if they have couple seats.

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:24.530
What should we eat afterward?

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:27.670
But as long as I'm with you, Itsuki-san,

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:28.790
I'd be happy eating anything.

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:33.250
- You're so cute, Shohei.
- Heh heh.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.900
(Aquarium, movie, fall foliage viewing...)

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:48.360

(Go to Minato's hometown)

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:02.690
Anyway...

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:04.140
That's about it.

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:06.750
Yeah.

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:17.130
Hmm?

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:23.670
Oh.

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:25.640
Um, I'll just leave this here.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:26.500
Huh?

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:27.000
Ah.

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:28.080
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:30.850
Minato's...

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:35.260
I completely forgot.

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:49.480
Is this the place?

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:53.380
I don't remember at all.

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:00.560
Oh my.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.660
Well, well, well.

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:05.020
Oh, if it isn't you, mister.

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:06.740
Do you remember me?

00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:08.370
Uh...

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:11.510
Um...

00:17:11.850 --> 00:17:13.650
You're just like Minato-chan said you'd be.

00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:15.880
And after you poured your heart out to me.

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:18.230
I'm sorry.

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:21.280
So?

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:23.060
Your broken heart...

00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:24.280
has it healed?

00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:26.350
Yes.

00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:28.540
It's all thanks to Minato.

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:31.940
Oh, is that so? That's wonderful.

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:36.720
- Um... he said he'd be here today.
- He's here.

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:38.450
Did you two have plans?

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:39.650
Oh, no.

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:41.000
He forgot something, so I brought it over.

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:43.130
My, you're so thoughtful.

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:45.120
I'm heading out.

00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:46.310
The door's unlocked.

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:47.630
Just let yourself in.

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:50.450
Okay, thank you.

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:51.680
See you next time, then.

00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:59.670
To think he said, "It's all thanks to Minato."

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:01.730
You're something else, Minato-chan.

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:05.560
My instincts are never wrong.

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:11.890
- So cute.
- I'm having this one.

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:14.090
So cute.

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:16.210
Mmm, this is delicious!

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:18.030
That's our Minato-chan.

00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:20.010
He even has great taste in souvenirs.

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:23.000
That's rich coming from the one
who was blowing up my phone this morning.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:23.600
Hey!

00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:24.890
Were we interrupting something?

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:28.600
Ah, he's not denying it.

00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:31.900
I told you, it's nothing.

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:34.090
How can it be nothing?

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:37.210
You went to an amusement park
and then you stayed the night.

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:39.610
Jeez! Keep your voice down.

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:40.690
So what exactly happened?

00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:42.830
- Tell us already!
- Leave me alone.

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:44.390
Just eat your dessert.

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:47.150
- At least show us a picture.
- Yeah!

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:51.130
- I told you, there are no pictures.
- You didn't even take a picture of the guy you like?

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:54.190
- Some photographer you are.
- What?

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:56.840
Hey, wait a second.

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.760
Does this mean Minato-chan won the bet?

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.160
Oh.

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:03.350
Yeah.

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:05.280
Didn't I tell you guys?

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:06.970
I don't care how straight a guy is.

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:08.670
I can always...

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:09.950
make him mine.

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:14.030
It was too easy to even call it a bet.

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:16.270
But a deal's a deal.

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:20.980
No way. Shaving my head is too much.

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:22.910
But hey, Minato-chan...

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:26.050
I still don't think getting revenge is a good idea.

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:28.110
Because that guy...

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.400
he has real feelings for you now, doesn't he?

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:33.180
About that...

00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:37.280
My feelings for Shizuma...

00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:39.680
I can't feel that way anymore.

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:05.540
This.

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:07.540
You forgot this.

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:09.510
Ah.

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:16.160
Shizuma.

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:21.810
Wait, Shizuma.

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:27.150
Wait, just wait.

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:28.390
Hey.

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:34.510
Was it all...

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:37.320
Was it all a lie?

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:40.010
No, that's not it.

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:42.180
I have to tell him.

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:44.310
Hurry.

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:47.510
The truth is, my feelings for you, Shizuma...

00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:52.570
I should've learned my lesson
when Yuka broke up with me.

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:55.380
I never learn, do I?

00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:56.570
What an idiot.

00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:01.970
Congratulations.

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:03.500
You got exactly what you wanted.

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:21.090
You know,

00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:22.970
I saw you do this before.

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:26.050
If you keep pulling stunts like this,

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:27.910
you're never going to win anyone's heart.

00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:30.760
You'll be alone for the rest of your life.

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:35.230
I didn't understand what you meant back then.

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:38.150
But now...

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:40.970
I see exactly what you meant.

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:31.700
(Next Episode)
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:34.670
Why?

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:38.950
The Minato who was with Shizuma...
was all of that really a lie?

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:40.830
I don't care anymore.

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:42.550
I want you to hold me.

00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:44.540
Minato.
