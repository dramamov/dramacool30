[Whispers of Fate]

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.950
[Episode 38]

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.180
Why is Master only just getting back?

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.800
Why has he been acting
so secretive lately?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.710
Chunji?

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.080
Master.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.710
You're still up at this hour?

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.950
Where are your royal guards?

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.070
It's actually quite uncomfortable

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.930
being followed by them every day.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.280
Besides,

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.310
I grew up here.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.800
This is my home.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.910
Who would want

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.840
to be followed around even at home?

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.030
I remember when you

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.160
first came here—

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.389
you sat right here

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.199
watching me practice calligraphy.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:11.270
You were so mischievous,

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.710
sneakily drawing on my face

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.040
while I was sleeping.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.630
In the blink of an eye,

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:17.910
you've grown so much.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.090
Yes, indeed.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.860
Later, you taught me swordsmanship.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.980
Because this place is remote,

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.270
I could continue practicing here at night

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.530
whatever swordsmanship I couldn't master
during the day.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.420
It seems like it's been so long

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.270
since I've had a heart-to-heart talk

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:57.800
with you like this, Master.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.960
Chunji,

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.110
do you resent me?

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.040
I wouldn't dare.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.380
Wouldn't dare?

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.190
Then you do resent me.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.170
It's my fault

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.800
for raising you to be
too demanding of yourself.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.330
You've always worked hard,

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.890
always seeking approval.

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.040
I...

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.440
have indeed failed you in some ways.

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.430
No.

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:29.210
I am the one who has failed you, Master.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.710
Master...

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.590
If one day

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:37.870
you discover...

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.560
Just say what you want to say.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.870
If you discover I've done

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.670
many wrong things behind your back

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.670
and told many lies...

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.040
Actually, I didn't cook

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.340
the medicinal porridge that day.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.270
You think I didn't notice?

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.550
You couldn't even roast a sweet potato
when you were little.

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:03.550
That porridge was

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.830
fresh, fragrant, sweet,
and rich in ingredients.

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:06.960
It was clearly made

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.270
by a palace cook.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.550
Nothing escapes your notice, Master.

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:11.270
Of course.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:16.200
It's late.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.410
I'll walk you back to your room.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.030
Zhong Chunji,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.800
why have you become so cowardly?

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:28.230
Tomorrow.

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.080
I'll definitely confess everything
to Master tomorrow.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.640
Come on.

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.159
Time to go back to sleep.

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.909
Coming.

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:37.390
Master.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.720
It feels like I'm back in my childhood.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.350
Orders from Sword Master Tang:

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:57.810
While Mr. Chi is detained,

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.820
no one is allowed to approach him.

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:02.790
I've brought some food and wine

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.030
and just want to see him briefly.

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.830
Food is allowed,

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:05.760
but after our inspection,

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.080
we'll deliver it for you, miss.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.350
We have our duties to fulfill.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.480
Please understand.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:16.760
Of course, I understand.

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.020
I'm the one intruding.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.930
Well then...

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:21.880
I'll trouble you with this.

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.930
With this final vial of serum,

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:45.390
Chi Yun should be able to hold on

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:46.920
until the antidote is made.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.590
Mr. Tang!

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.500
Mr. Tang, bad news.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.030
Chi's poison has flared up.

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.630
He injured the guards
and broke out of the cell.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.409
Chi Yun was fine yesterday.

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.820
How could his poison suddenly flare up?

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:02.770
The guards said

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.410
Xifang Tao came yesterday.

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.170
But they didn't let her in.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.540
Enemy attack on the fortress.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.330
Disaster imminent.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.120
Extremely urgent.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.150
Return immediately.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:33.470
He escaped?

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.120
How could you let him escape?

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:39.690
If his poison has erupted,

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:40.680
the villagers at the foot of the mountain

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:41.680
will be in danger.

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.760
How could you all be so careless?

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:51.440
Xifang Tao!

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:00.390
Miss Xifang.

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.590
[Central Plains Sword Alliance]

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:45.890
-Hello, Sword Master Tang.
-Hello, Sword Master Tang.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:47.409
Let's go.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.030
Mr. Tang!

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.880
I already know about the situation.

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.960
There's something suspicious
about Chi Yun's sudden madness.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.760
It may be dangerous for you
to search for him alone.

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:59.560
Shui Duopo came to me last night

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.200
and said the prescription this time

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.660
is absolutely foolproof.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.460
Once this matter is settled,

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:05.790
my worries

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:06.920
will mostly be gone.

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:08.530
As for finding Mr. Chi,

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:10.350
let the Sword Alliance help you.

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:11.080
Master Shao.

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:12.270
I'll handle

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:14.630
Chi Yun's matter myself.

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:17.080
Wait!

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:19.390
You...

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.080
Don't push yourself too hard.

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.030
Don't try to shoulder

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:26.230
everything alone.

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:27.960
And don't treat the help of others

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.120
as a burden!

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:31.540
Mr. Tang,

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:33.080
you're still young.

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:34.230
You have a long road

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:35.590
ahead of you.

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:37.780
Everyone, sooner or later,

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:39.539
grows weary and lonely.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.280
The jianghu is in turmoil.

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:44.990
Having someone by your side

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:47.050
is always better than walking alone!

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:51.960
Master Shao,

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:55.330
Xifang Tao still has allies
in the Sword Alliance.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:55.830
You need to stay

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:57.350
to prevent internal conflict.

00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:58.110
But you...

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:12.850
Mr. Tang.

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:14.680
I once thought you could be

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.000
the one to shake up the jianghu

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.790
and reshape its order.

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:20.630
But circumstances shift without warning,

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:23.400
and and we who are caught in the game
can only submit to fate.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.790
I hope that one day

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.080
you'll stop forcing yourself

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:29.910
and learn to take care of yourself.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:43.990
Stone,

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.350
Master Tang's friend is in trouble.

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:47.320
Instead of going to comfort him,

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.650
what are you doing here?

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:50.710
Planting a tree.

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:51.640
Planting a tree?

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:52.810
Why plant a tree now?

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:54.110
Just...

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:55.960
suddenly...

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:57.280
need to...

00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:58.840
plant a tree.

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:01.340
Let's go. Let's go.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.000
Why is Stone acting so strangely today?

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.670
Usually he clings to Mr. Tang,

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.560
but now that something this serious
has happened,

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:08.590
how can he still be so calm

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:09.790
planting a tree here?

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:15.160
Master!

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.750
Master seems distracted

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:24.330
and is carrying medicine.

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:26.420
Is he going to deliver it to someone?

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:32.000
Chi Yun's incident
definitely wasn't an accident.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.230
I must deliver this prescription quickly,

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:36.090
before anything else goes wrong.

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:47.680
Master Shao, you're in such a hurry.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.200
Where are you heading?

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:56.920
Who are you?

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:29.150
Master...

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:38.440
Master!

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:40.440
Who are you?

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:41.870
Why did you hurt my master?

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:42.510
Chunji.

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.160
Leave me behind and run.

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.160
How could I leave you behind?

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.110
Only a tool

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.130
can be a true tool.

00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:57.440
Nice to meet you.

00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:58.680
You can call me

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.350
Ghostly Peony.

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:03.110
Ghostly Peony, you're still alive?

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:04.160
Chunji,

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:05.930
fire the signal flare now!

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:11.770
Have you thought it through, Princess?

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:13.440
Xifang Tao,

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:14.830
what exactly are you

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:16.560
and Ghostly Peony trying to do?

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:22.320
Godfather, looks like

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.720
you've fully recovered.

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:25.710
Liu Yan betrayed us.

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:28.160
The poisoned people have been

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.040
transferred to Sword King City
by Tang Lici.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.510
This amount of Black Tuli

00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:32.650
is far from enough.

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:34.560
Godfather, you haven't given up

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:35.960
on our master's mission.

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:36.800
I heard

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:38.990
the bronze tree has been destroyed,

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:40.650
and our master's plan failed.

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:43.510
Don't you want freedom, Godfather?

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:45.040
Freedom?

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:47.200
The freedom to decide

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.400
your own destiny.

00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:51.830
Why do I need freedom?

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:53.440
A bottle exists

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.080
to hold water.

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:57.360
A free bottle

00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:59.370
is nothing but useless trash.

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:01.110
Strings are meant

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:04.380
to be tied to the tuning pegs
of instruments.

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:06.470
Free strings

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:09.170
are just useless threads.

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:11.230
But people aren't tools.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.200
Perhaps a bottle wants to hold wine.

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:15.520
Perhaps strings

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:17.680
want to be fishing lines.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.350
That's merely changing

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:21.150
from one kind of tool to another.

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:23.490
People who find their purpose

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:25.160
are useful tools.

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:27.970
Those who can't find their purpose

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.370
are no different

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:30.710
from trash.

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:33.600
Only after dying once did I understand.

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:35.400
As long as our master lives,

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:36.940
a puppet remains a puppet.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.160
Even with thoughts and feelings...

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:41.760
how is that different

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:43.800
from being a tool?

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:47.110
Rather than discussing illusory freedom,

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.510
Godfather, why don't you just tell me

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:50.710
what you want me to do?

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:52.680
I need more Black Tuli.

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:54.440
Tang Lici...

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.040
keeps ruining my plans.

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.200
Godfather, your trap in West Wind Garden

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.800
wasn't completely useless.

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:04.590
Chi Yun's poisoning

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:05.830
has already consumed most of

00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:06.960
Tang Lici's energy.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:08.990
So, he'll definitely

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:09.990
have someone else

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:10.920
contact Liu Yan.

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:13.200
Whoever that person is,

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.410
following them gives us

00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:17.960
a much better chance of finding Liu Yan

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:19.420
than following Tang Lici.

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:30.700
Godfather.

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:32.440
I've already searched

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.990
for clues in the direction

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.600
Master Shao was heading.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.230
There's a small mountain village ahead.

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:39.630
Liu Yan is indeed there.

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:42.280
Still one step too late.

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:43.320
No.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:44.830
I must let Mr. Tang know

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:45.800
that Ghostly Peony is

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:47.320
behind Xifang Tao.

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:49.200
Between Chunji and me,

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.160
one of us must make it out alive.

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:52.400
Princess.

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:54.040
Have you decided

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:55.770
which side you want to stand on?

00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:57.910
Princess, you're a clever person.

00:14:58.110 --> 00:14:59.920
Coming here from the Sword Alliance

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:01.380
will take at least an hour.

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:03.040
An hour

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:04.840
is more than enough time

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:06.590
for us to kill Master Shao

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:09.200
and spare your life.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:10.980
When that happens,

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:12.940
we'll simply tell everyone

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:14.470
that Master Shao

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.040
discovered you were an impostor,

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:20.160
that you killed your master

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:21.990
to preserve your wealth and status,

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:23.200
and that I,

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.000
Xifang Tao, arrived too late

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.710
to save him.

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:29.420
You think people will believe you

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:31.800
just because you say so?

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.410
What I just said

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:34.680
is indeed false.

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:37.510
But the fake tattoo on your body

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.670
is enough to turn my lies

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:41.300
into truth.

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:42.920
After all, wouldn't the words

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:44.520
of an innocent person like me

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:47.040
be more credible than those of

00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:49.750
someone who's definitely a fake princess?

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:51.320
Chunji,

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:53.740
is what she's saying true?

00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:57.990
Princess,

00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:00.870
are you willing to take that gamble?

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:05.550
Tai'e Sword's

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:06.470
Offering!

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:09.150
Heaven-Changing Scripture—

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:10.680
Reverse Yin and Yang.

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:17.350
Chunji,

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:18.830
I once said

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:20.920
that we should be good people

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:22.380
even if it comes at a price.

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:23.000
Remember,

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:24.860
I never blamed you.

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:26.830
Chunji, run!

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:28.290
You must survive

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:29.400
and tell everyone

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:30.870
that Ghostly Peony is still alive!

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:32.410
Heaven-Changing Scripture—

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:33.940
Remaking Heaven and Earth.

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:43.040
Master!

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:45.230
Master!

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:52.750
Injured by the Heaven-Changing Scripture—

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:53.750
people will only believe you're

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:54.740
killed by the Rebirth Scroll.

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:55.560
Master!

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:02.590
Princess,

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:04.359
your master

00:17:04.359 --> 00:17:05.819
is down to his last breath.

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:08.280
Are you sure you want to waste

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:09.640
your time on me?

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:32.640
Master.

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:35.710
Master...

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:38.440
Master.

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:39.960
You must hold on.

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:41.230
I'll go back

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:42.440
and find the best

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:44.840
imperial doctors in the world
to treat you!

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:50.810
So this is the bond
between master and disciple.

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:51.550
Well then...

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:52.480
You must hold on.

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:54.120
Master.

00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:54.950
Godfather.

00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:56.230
Leave it to me.

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:02.790
Master!

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:20.600
Ms. Zhong,

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:22.660

Huoyun Fortress.

It's spreading rapidly.

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:23.750
They say those poisoned people

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:25.230
have horrifying faces and are contagious.

00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:26.070
We need to stay away from them.

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:26.600
Indeed.

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:27.200
Excuse me.

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:29.530
Where is Huoyun Fortress?

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:31.860
A poisoned person!

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:33.230
-A poisoned person!
-A poisoned person!

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:33.750
Run!

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:34.440
Hurry! Run!

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:35.440
Let's go get help!

00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:46.680
Darn it.

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:48.800
Is he somewhere nearby?

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:50.550
Where?

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:51.600
Where did he go?

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:52.270
Exactly.

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:53.750
There.

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:55.330
Look at that.

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:56.570
That one ahead!

00:21:57.230 --> 00:21:57.840
Hey, man!

00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:00.360
You're looking for Huoyun Fortress, right?

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:01.960
We're from Huoyun Fortress.

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:05.230
Are you blind?

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:06.270
Boss?

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:06.790
Chi?

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:09.070
How could you not recognize me?

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:10.330
Boss, it really is you!

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:12.880
What happened to your face?

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:13.680
It's nothing.

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:14.880
I got a bit poisoned.

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:15.480
Poisoned?

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:16.710
Where's the bastard

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:17.710
who poisoned you?

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:18.230
Guys,

00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:19.310
let's avenge our boss!

00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:20.880
-Yes, avenge our boss!
-Yes, avenge our boss!

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:21.940
Alright, alright.

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:23.800
That one is already dead.

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:25.950
Why are you all here?

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:27.260
The letter.

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:28.750
We came to rescue you.

00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:29.600
Look.

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:31.330
We received a distress letter.

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:33.230
I never wrote this.

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:35.780
Who sent it to you?

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:36.920
It's forged?

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:37.790
Forged?

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:40.510
The rogue went through all this trouble
to forge a letter.

00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:41.360
What for?

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:42.910
Who cares?

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:44.640
As long as we got to see our boss here,

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:45.970
the trip wasn't wasted.

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:47.360
-That's right.
-Yeah!

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:48.070
Today, let's have

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:48.990
a good drink together,

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:49.850
get some sleep,

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:50.710
and everything will be fine
when we wake up.

00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:52.030
-Yes, absolutely.
-Yeah.

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:52.470
Let's go.

00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:53.230
-Come on, let's drink.
-Let's go.

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:54.760
-Let's go drink.
-Let's go.

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:55.680
Boss.

00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:57.470
When you left the fortress back then,

00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:58.070
we all thought

00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:59.130
you'd be back soon.

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:00.750
We've all missed you.

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:01.920
I also...

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:05.690
Why don't...

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:07.840
you all come back with me

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:08.960
to the Central Plains Sword Alliance?

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:10.360
That would be wonderful.

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:10.760
But...

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:13.160
We're all bandits who rule the mountain.

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:14.310
Will the alliance accept us?

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:15.160
We are...

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:17.200
chivalrous bandits

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.000
who rob the rich to help the poor.

00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:20.200
Bandits? What's that supposed to mean?

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.070
I'm well-connected
in the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:22.750
My reputation is formidable.

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:23.820
They'll definitely accept you.

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:24.840
Boss is so impressive.

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:25.370
Let's go.

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:26.400
Boss.

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:29.160
That runaway fiancée of yours...

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:30.090
did you find her?

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.270
Chi Yun!

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:47.070
Boss?

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:49.730
If you can't remember,
don't force yourself.

00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:51.790
What exactly did I forget?

00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:53.120
Boss, it's me, Datou!

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:54.310
Boss, are you alright?

00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:55.910
Don't you even recognize me?

00:23:58.560 --> 00:23:59.340
Wake up!

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:09.680
He's been poisoned
by the Blood Ghost Pill.

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.540
He can't recognize any of you now.

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:15.550
Who are you?

00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:17.370
What did you just feed me?

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:18.990
Mr. Tang sent me

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:19.920
to take you back.

00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:20.860
Come with me.

00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:21.840
Foxy Tang?

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:24.320
How come I didn't know

00:24:24.670 --> 00:24:26.120
he had a woman by his side?

00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:27.550
He figured out so quickly

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:28.810
the letter was forged?

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:31.360
Why do you wear a mask?

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:34.300
Why do you have so many questions?

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:36.310
What's your surname then?

00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:37.310
My surname is Bai.

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:40.290
-Let's go.
-Go.

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:46.750
This road is the only way

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:47.880
to Huoyun Fortress.

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:49.120
Following this path,

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:51.320
I should be able to catch up with Chi Yun.

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.160
White Stone Formation?

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:54.020
It's Bai Suche.

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:55.640
She has found Chi Yun.

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:01.940
It's getting dark.

00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:03.840
Even if we're in a hurry,
we should fill our stomachs first, right?

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:04.200
Boss,

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:04.750
look over there.

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:04.940
Isn't that an inn?

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:07.200
[Baiwei Inn]

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:07.960
Guys, guys.

00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:10.030
I don't even know
if the Mind-Clearing Pill will last

00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:11.840
until he returns to the Sword Alliance.

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:13.840
And now they've detoured for a meal.

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:15.680
I must quickly

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:16.360
get them back

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:17.490
on the original path

00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:19.120
to avoid missing Mr. Tang.

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:20.450
This wine is excellent.

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:21.510
He's even drinking now?

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:22.230
The wine is so good.

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:23.270
I saved it especially for you, Boss!

00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:24.400
Good wine! Cheers!

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:26.510
We need to get back on the road soon.

00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:27.440
You can't drink.

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:28.500
Why can't we drink?

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:29.790
We brothers haven't seen each other

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:30.710
for so many years.

00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:32.510
Today, we must have a proper drink.

00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:33.880
Even if the gods themselves came down,

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:34.640
we'd still be drinking!

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:35.640
-That's right!
-Yeah!

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:36.300
Bottoms up!

00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:39.010
Waiter!

00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:40.990
Boss, you want to switch

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:41.680
to a bigger bowl?

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:42.160
Sir!

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:44.270
What can I get you?

00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:45.130
Bring me a pot of tea.

00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:45.990
You guys drink.

00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:46.890
Right away.

00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:48.360
Why do you want tea, Boss?

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:49.160
Yeah, Boss.

00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:50.410
Did I hear that right?

00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:51.140
You want tea?

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:52.330
Tea? Really?

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:53.030
Enough.

00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:54.790
You don't understand.

00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:56.360
I drank adulterated wine twice in a row.

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:57.200
After drinking, my head was spinning,

00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:58.840
and I couldn't remember anything.

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:00.300
It's better to drink less.

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:04.300
Waiter, hurry up with our dishes!

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:05.430
You can't get drunk.

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:06.680
We need to head to

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:07.930
the Central Plains Sword Alliance soon.

00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:09.330
We'll leave in two hours.

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:12.140
You all heard that, eh?

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:12.940
Drink less.

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.260
Come on, customers, this way.

00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:17.070
-Come on, let's drink.
-Come on.

00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:19.600
Boss.

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:21.550
Does that girl

00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:22.810
have something on you?

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:24.270
How much money do you owe her?

00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:25.790
We can all chip in
and help you pay it off.

00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:26.480
-That's right, Boss.
-Yeah.

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:27.810
-Yeah.
-We can help out.

00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:30.470
Stop talking nonsense.
You don't understand.

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:31.680
She cares about me.

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:33.510
That's why she's so controlling.

00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:34.640
I don't know why.

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:36.550
But when she scolds me...

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:37.470
Please, go upstairs.

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:38.590
I actually kind of like it.

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:39.070
Boss?

00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:39.550
You're not falling for her

00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:41.480
just because of her looks, are you?

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:42.750
Falling for her looks?

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:44.360
Then we'd have to see
what she looks like first.

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:46.020
We haven't even seen her face.

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.310
She's always wearing a veil

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:48.710
and never shows her face.

00:26:49.030 --> 00:26:50.430
That can't be right, man.

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:51.710
-Yeah, exactly.
-Yeah.

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:52.370
I get it now.

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:54.270
She must be incredibly ugly,

00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:55.470
and that's why she doesn't show her face.

00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:56.070
Maybe

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:57.920
her face is covered in pockmarks,

00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:59.270
with a crooked mouth and squinting eyes.

00:26:59.270 --> 00:26:59.880
Right?

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:01.210
-Yes, exactly.
-Right.

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:01.960
Am I right?

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:03.220
-That's right.
-Yeah.

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:05.030
A bunch of scoundrels.

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:07.860
But come to think of it,

00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:09.550
I don't think

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:11.470
she was being harsh with me.

00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:12.310
She actually likes me.

00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:13.240
What do you mean?

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:14.550
I'm serious.

00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:16.320
When I see her, she feels

00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:17.410
very familiar.

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:18.650
When she's harsh with me,

00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:19.680
it feels like

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:20.440
my long-awaited wish

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:21.700
has finally come true.

00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:24.090
Take care, sir.

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:26.600
There's a feeling of satisfaction.

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.070
Although I don't know

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:28.640
why.

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:30.710
Boss, your tolerance for alcohol
has gotten worse.

00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:32.960
You're talking nonsense
after just one bowl.

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:34.200
Please, come in.

00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:38.120
Come on, let's drink.

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:40.380
Pour it up. Drink to our heart's content.

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:41.790
Miss,

00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:43.270
those guests

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:44.880
have already gone upstairs to sleep.

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:46.270
Maybe you should just let them sleep.

00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:47.800
You can continue your journey
early tomorrow morning.

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.400
A few hours won't make
much difference, right?

00:27:58.160 --> 00:27:59.400
I've already called them.

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:00.800
They should be down soon.

00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:02.710
I...

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:05.660
If you have something to say, just say it.

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:07.440
Did you...

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:09.890
hear all that stuff

00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:11.640
I said earlier?

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:15.440
You said that on purpose for me to hear?

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:16.440
I swear to heaven!

00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:18.560
All that nonsense about

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:20.440
"crooked mouth, squinty eyes,
and pockmarked face"—

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:21.200
I didn't say any of that.

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:21.930
They said it.

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:24.200
They were all talking nonsense.

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:25.750
They're used to running their mouths.

00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:27.750
Please don't take it to heart, miss.

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:29.440
I don't mind.

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:30.950
Miss Bai,

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:33.160
do you wear that veil...

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:35.800
because of your appearance?

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:38.600
It's okay.

00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:40.750
After I was poisoned,

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:42.930
people called me a monster too.

00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:43.880
When the poison flares up,

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:44.960
I look very strange as well.

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:46.440
People on the street even call me a demon.

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:48.880
It's just the outer shell.
Don't let it bother you.

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:49.550
Besides...

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:51.440
I find it strange.

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:53.400
I don't know why I became so attached

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:54.880
to you the first time we met.

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:56.740
To be honest, when I first saw you,

00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:57.750
my mind was filled

00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:58.400
with all kinds

00:28:58.400 --> 00:28:59.600
of strange thoughts.

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:00.470
Like "I would rather die

00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:01.790
than let anything happen to you,"

00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:03.850
and even wanting to leave you a dowry.

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.530
Isn't that ridiculous?

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:10.400
Probably just hallucinations
from the poison.

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:11.460
Don't you think...

00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:24.030
Why are you crying?

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:25.900
Did I say something wrong?

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:33.400
What if all of that isn't a hallucination?

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:34.400
What if you became

00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:35.880
like this because of me?

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:38.450
That can't be it, right?

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:39.470
Foxy Tang said I was

00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:40.470
poisoned by someone.

00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:41.400
I was already poisoned

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:42.330
before I met you.

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:44.180
Could it be that you...

00:29:44.270 --> 00:29:45.160
knew me before?

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:47.360
Foxy Tang won't tell me

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:48.270
how I ended up poisoned.

00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:49.310
If you know,

00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:50.310
could you tell me?

00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:52.440
Can't let Chi Yun

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:54.300
remember West Wind Garden again.

00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:57.070
When we get back to the Sword Alliance,

00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:58.130
I'll tell you then.

00:29:58.230 --> 00:29:59.690
I'll go urge them to hurry.

00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:10.950
Why such a rush to
get to the Sword Alliance?

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.630
In the middle of the night,
we have to push on

00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:13.360
instead of sleeping.

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:15.420
Just get on the road when you're told.

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:15.920
Right,

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:16.510
Miss Bai?

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:18.990
Boss, why do you trust her so much?

00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:19.960
I feel like

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:21.700
Miss Bai is deliberately taking us
on a detour.

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:22.680
The fastest route

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:24.440
to the Sword Alliance
goes past West Wind Garden,

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:27.050
but she's leading us around
through the Western Ridge.

00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:28.400
West Wind Garden?

00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:30.360
Oh no!

00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:31.840
Boss?

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:32.470
What are you trying to do

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:33.640
to our boss, you woman?

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:34.300
Move aside!

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:35.440
If we don't knock him out now...

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:35.880
Are you alright, Boss?

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:36.920
No one will be able to stop him
once he loses control!

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:37.790
I suspected

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:39.160
something was wrong with you all along.

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:39.960
Boss likes you,

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:40.880
so I kept quiet.

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:42.440
You've been leaving marks along the road,

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:44.470
exposing our location the whole way.

00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:45.120
However,

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:46.070
don't expect

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:47.510
your accomplices to find us.

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:49.080
I've changed all the marks you made

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:50.640
to point in the opposite direction.

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:52.170
You changed all my markers?

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:53.500
Move aside now.

00:30:53.570 --> 00:30:55.070
He's about to lose control!

00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:56.360
Who are you trying to fool?

00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:57.120
We're not as

00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:58.120
gullible as Boss.

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:09.360
This direction is wrong.

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:12.090
Did someone tamper with the marks?

00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:14.450
Chi Yun has been missing for so long.

00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:16.510
I can't keep going in circles anymore.

00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:17.550
Soul-Seeking.

00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:23.760
Master Shao?

00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:26.430
Why is Master Shao here?

00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:30.680
Chi Yun.

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:43.170
Boss...

00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:44.400
why?

00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:46.750
Chi Yun!

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:48.710
Chi Yun, wake up!

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:49.470
Chi Yun!

00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:54.240
Rebirth Scroll—

00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:54.840
Truth.

00:32:57.700 --> 00:32:58.230
Release.

00:33:43.250 --> 00:33:44.250
Chi Yun.

00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:46.550
Wake up.

00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:08.540
Boss, why...

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:28.239
Kill me...

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:44.280
Using your blood to suppress the poison

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:45.239
can indeed slow

00:34:45.239 --> 00:34:46.150
its onset.

00:34:47.150 --> 00:34:48.810
But if he loses control again,

00:34:48.989 --> 00:34:50.989
it will trigger a violent backlash.

00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:53.920
At best, he'll die like the others,

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:55.050
his body exploding.

00:34:55.679 --> 00:34:57.810
At worst, he'll become like Yu Qifeng—

00:34:58.110 --> 00:35:00.710
who knows what kind of monster
he'll turn into.

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:02.720
If that day ever comes...

00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:04.450
I advise you to be merciful

00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:06.320
and end his suffering quickly.

00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:01.470
You just took
that old fool Yu's strike head-on,

00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:02.670
and now you want to drink?

00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:03.880
Your stomachache...

00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:05.550
I'm telling you, it's been a year,

00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:07.350
and it hasn't gotten any better.

00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:10.670
Anyway,

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:12.470
you can't be that Yique Yinyang

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:14.550
who brought disaster to the country.

00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:16.150
Besides,

00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:18.860
those golden eyes
and that forehead mark of yours

00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:18.960

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:20.420

I've been waiting for you for so long.

00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:58.490
I waited from day...

00:36:58.950 --> 00:37:00.700

And I waited from night until day again.

00:37:09.490 --> 00:37:10.660
But you never came.

00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:12.980
I'm sorry.

00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:16.540
I came too late.

00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:23.320
In this lifetime...

00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:26.760
I actually got to hear you apologize.

00:37:30.190 --> 00:37:30.880
But...

00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:31.880
But...

00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:35.990
I won't forgive you.

00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:38.540
Save it for our next life...

00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:41.790
when you can say it again.

Say it!

00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:39.420

Master Shao...

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:48.180
Are you waiting for Shao Yanping?

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:50.670
Too bad. He won't be coming.

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:53.440
Yan used himself to test the medicine.

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:55.100
His body is already very weak.

00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:57.330
We are no match for Xifang Tao.

00:39:58.030 --> 00:39:59.360
If Yan can escape,

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:01.940
Tang Lici will be able to protect him.

00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:14.720
Yan, run!

00:40:16.770 --> 00:40:19.970
Sacrificing yourself just to
buy Liu Yan a chance to flee?

00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:21.190
I told you before,

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:23.040
you should find another man.

00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:24.550
Silly girl,

00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:26.630
treating men like this

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:28.880
only makes them care less about you.

00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:29.950
Be a smart girl

00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:31.670
in your next life.

00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:36.380
Heaven-Changing Scripture—

00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:39.280

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:45.440
Stop.

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:53.110
Yan.

00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:54.650
Let Xiaohong go.

00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:56.400
It's been a long time,

00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:57.150
Master Liu.

00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:05.020
Who would have thought

00:41:05.070 --> 00:41:07.400
that the once noble and revered Master Liu

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:09.490
would live in a place like this?

00:41:10.590 --> 00:41:12.120
This place is far too crude,

00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:14.400
hardly suitable for
developing the antidote.

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:16.600
Come back to the Sword Alliance with me.

00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:19.170
Do you want to come with me on your own,

00:41:19.570 --> 00:41:21.100
or shall I take you by force?

00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:27.010
Do you choose to leave on your own,

00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:29.590
or do you choose to die here?

00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:31.920
Is this your last resort

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:33.110
to save your life?

00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:35.280
At worst,

00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:38.110
we'll die together.

00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:43.390
I've changed my mind.

00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:45.660
Let Xiaohong go.

00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:52.230
Yan.

00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:01.030
Liu Yan.

00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:05.070
Did you become soft-hearted

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:07.940
after experiencing great calamity,

00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:08.760
or have you

00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:11.070
always been this way?
