Alright.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.630
Why are you so eager to see me?

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:09.710
Jia.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.084
If you call me that, I'll leave.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.110
No, don't go.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:16.790
You should listen to your dad.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.300
He's setting you up on blind dates
for your own good.

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:21.700
Think about it.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.070
You're not young anymore.

00:02:23.128 --> 00:02:25.740
It's already nice that someone's
even willing to meet you, right?

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.350
Stop being so picky.

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:28.420
Get married sooner.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.740
Your late mother would be happy.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:31.580
Wait.

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:33.900
How did you know my mom passed away?

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:37.830
I told him.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.020
Dad?

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:41.740
Why haven't you left yet?

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.110
What's wrong with your lips?

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:53.950
I see.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:55.900
Is this how you do your lips

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.830
to tank every blind date?

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.180
You look like
you ate a red dragon fruit.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.140
Look at you.

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.020
When did you start ganging up?

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.020
It's not ganging up.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.217
It was a deal.

00:03:07.217 --> 00:03:08.550
And he's unbelievably annoying.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:09.670
He's pretty obnoxious too.

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.070
One's self deluded,

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.580
the other's a busybody.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.830
Does she talk this rudely to everyone?

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.700
- She does.
- Does what?

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.270
I only talk like this to you two.

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.860
Alright. Deal's done.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.950
I'm leaving.

00:03:33.128 --> 00:03:34.950
- Jia!
- I'm not going on blind dates.

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.040
I'm not getting married either.
I like being single.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.140
I'm happy

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.460
growing old alone, okay?

00:03:39.462 --> 00:03:40.769
What kind of attitude is that?

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.230
The attitude of pursuing happiness.

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.670
Are you happy like this?

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:44.510
I don't know.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:45.420
But I do know

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.350
if I just marry someone random,

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:48.420
I'll definitely be unhappy.

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:50.550
Do you want me to be unhappy?

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.350
Are you done talking?

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.230
- Not yet.
- Then say it next time.

00:03:56.284 --> 00:03:57.817
- Jia...
- I'm meeting friends later.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.790
(If only I didn't know about
Gu Yejia's dad's secret...)

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:12.420
(Jeez.)

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:23.670
Hello, Sir.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.180
Have a look at the menu.

00:04:29.084 --> 00:04:30.910
What do people eat
when they're in a bad mood?

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.550
Here! We have a gentleman here
in a bad mood.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:34.580
Hello, Sir.

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.940
Would you come on stage
and do a magic trick with me?

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:37.820
Why?

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.790
Because the applause will cheer you up.

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.230
You'll get a free fruit platter.

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:43.380
Free fruit platter?

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.060
Mr. Yu

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.150
is like that.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.180
Alright, don't be mad.

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:49.670
It's on me.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:51.230
- Order whatever you want.
- Seriously?

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:52.180
Let's sit here.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.150
- Sure.
- Excuse me.

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.990
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:55.860
- coming next is a magic show!
- Dao.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:56.940
Well. No need for the menu.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:57.740
Appearance Illusion!

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.500
Just get us anything around 300 yuan.

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.020
- Sure thing
- Thank you.

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.110
So

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.150
Mr. Yu and you weren't on a date?

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.420
Boring.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.790
Instead of finding your own boyfriend,

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.740
why are you always digging
for my gossip?

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.710
As if it's easy to find someone.

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:15.030
Wait, Dr. Gu,

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.110
why was Mr. Yu with your dad?

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.000
How would I know?

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.820
- They're both weird.
- Please watch carefully.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.470
- Maybe they're as thick as thieves.
-Three.

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:22.310
Two.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.340
One.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:24.340
Ta-da!

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.180
How do you feel now?

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.230
Better?

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:30.110
The magic's choking.

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:31.580
Thank you, everyone.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:32.940
Mr. Yu!

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.550
Well done, Mr. Yu.

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:36.740
Why are you here?

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.110
This is my table.

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:40.728
Sit down. No one's fighting you for it.

00:05:43.684 --> 00:05:44.790
Here's your fruit platter.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.950
Thank you.

00:05:46.884 --> 00:05:48.060
This is my fruit platter.

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.060
You're so stingy
to order only a fruit platter.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:54.070
Is that a problem?

00:05:54.106 --> 00:05:55.820
Tell me what you want. I'll treat you.

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.420
I want xiaolongbao
from the City God Temple.

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:00.500
Next time.

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:09.380
Why are you quiet?

00:06:13.484 --> 00:06:16.230
I didn't want to get involved in
your and your dad's drama.

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:19.940
Mr. Yu,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.180
why did Dr. Gu's dad come here?

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:24.350
He was here to pressure me
to get married.

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:26.350
No, he did not.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:28.940
Then why?

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:30.910
I'm very trustworthy.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.940
We're supposed to be on the same team.

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.300
Why are you taking her dad's side?

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.380
I'm trying to help her get married soon.

00:06:43.328 --> 00:06:46.195
Don't come to me for treatment
when you're sick or aching next time.

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:00.390
Mr. Yu.

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:02.790
You're back.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.259
Didn't you say you wanted

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:05.710
xiaolongbao from the City God Temple?

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:06.990
I went and got them for you.

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:09.870
What do you want?

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:12.300
Nothing.

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:13.140
Well...

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:17.060
Can you tell me Mr. Gu's secret?

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:18.310
No.

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:19.910
Give me back the xiaolongbao.

00:07:28.417 --> 00:07:30.440
The bathroom has been turned
into a walk-in closet.

00:07:30.462 --> 00:07:31.990
(Makeup counter, tub)
Why didn't you move the water meter?

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:33.320
(Wardrobe, Master bedroom, tile work)
What's wrong with you?

00:07:33.328 --> 00:07:33.990
Oh right.

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:36.420
So annoying!

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.230
The two bathrooms are just fine.

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:39.373
Why are they changing them?

00:07:39.373 --> 00:07:41.617
That's what happens
when you live with your parents.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:44.590
Good news.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:45.820
The client says

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.420
they need privacy,

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:48.940
so both bathrooms stay.

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:51.620
Yes! I don't need to move
the water meter.

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:52.620
Why are you celebrating?

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:55.780
You have to turn the wardrobe
back into a bathroom. All right?

00:07:57.790 --> 00:07:58.910
I'm so sick of this.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.350
Fine. Keep being annoyed.
I'm going to rest.

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:03.030
No, you're not.

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:05.790
It's going to be very noisy tonight.

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:07.510
Why?

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:08.710
Because

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.940
this year's night market
is right outside your place.

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:13.140
Ms. Lin,

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.420
is it the big fair
that has food, games, and music?

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:17.910
Yes. That's right.

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:19.620
Extremely loud.

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.350
He'll report it to the management
office and the community committee.

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:24.350
What a shame.

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.150
He won't enjoy the festival fun.

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:34.780
Says who?

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:38.900
I'm going this year.

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:40.540
I love night markets.

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:42.230
Seriously?

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:50.350
Andropause. He's acting weird.

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:51.660
Hopeless.

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:55.990
Do you know how to scoop goldfish?

00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:57.540
(Goldfish Scooping)
No.

00:08:57.830 --> 00:08:59.430
The paper side has to face up.

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:01.989
If you flip it over,
it fills with water,

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:03.980
the paper breaks,
and you can't catch anything.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:04.950
Right.

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:06.020
Do you know

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:08.140
how to tell if a fish is asleep?

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:09.470
No.

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:11.540
If the fins aren't moving, it's asleep.

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:13.140
Did you see any?

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:14.660
That one is flipping around.

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:16.020
That one's dead.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:17.380
I'll find one for you.

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:23.500
You didn't catch any.

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:29.830
What a waste of my xiaolongbao.

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:31.470
I queued for two hours

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:32.900
and got nothing out of him.

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:35.500
Forget it. I don't want to know.

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:37.950
I want to know!

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:39.500
Why aren't you anything like me?

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:40.540
You're not nosy at all.

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:43.500
Would you be interested
in your dad's gossip?

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:45.310
Of course.

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:46.900
And if I found out,

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:49.310
I'd use it to threaten him
for allowance.

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:50.500
Otherwise, I'd tell my mom.

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:53.230
You're sly.

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:55.190
Alright. I'm on my way.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.070
I saw Mr. Yu.

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:02.500
He's scooping goldfish...

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:06.740
He's really a child at heart.

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:11.540
He's not planning to eat it, is he?

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:16.620
Why can't you catch any?

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:17.460
Again.

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:21.030
Once more.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:22.700
Got one.

00:10:23.862 --> 00:10:25.328
What are you laughing at, kiddo?

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:30.540
One more. Again.

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:31.380
Again.

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:33.950
Is this a scam, Mister?

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:42.070
Counting this one,

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:44.020
you've spent a hundred yuan.

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:45.030
Still want to keep going?

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:47.470
Mister,

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:48.540
how much to buy one?

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:50.020
Ten yuan.

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:51.380
He actually bought a fish.

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:04.860
(Idle Group)

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:10.740
Hello.

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:14.990
How did you know I live here?

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:19.500
I saw you through
the window of the hotel.

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:22.020
What's the matter?

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:25.820
(Global Wellness Guide)

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:27.230
I wrote this book.

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:28.740
Now, do you believe

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:30.860
I'm a real wellness expert?

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:33.150
Thank you.

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:37.780
Aren't you going to invite me upstairs?

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:42.380
You're really rude.

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:45.340
Alright then.

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:46.340
Please.

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:47.430
Sure.

00:11:48.151 --> 00:11:50.410
The elevator is under maintenance.
We'll take the stairs.

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:51.460
Okay.

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:01.190
Which floor do you live on?

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:37.740
I can't help it.

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:39.020
Age hits the legs first.

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:40.070
Wait here.

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:45.150
What's this?

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:55.710
What is this supposed to mean?

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:58.940
If you have nothing to talk about,
we can talk about goldfish

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:00.110
- to avoid awkwardness.
- No.

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:01.110
I mean,

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:02.950
you're not letting me in?

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:04.350
No one comes into my place.

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:05.900
Never?

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:09.070
Almost never.

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.900
How did my daughter make friends
with someone like you?

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:16.780
- Want some xiaolongbao?
- Yes. Of course.

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:19.310
I love xiaolongbao.

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:21.740
Nutritious

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:23.660
and soft.

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:25.740
Age hits teeth first.

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:27.900
Age hits everything.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.020
As long as I'm young at heart.

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:31.500
Delicious.

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:35.110
Can I get your autograph?

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.830
Sure.

(Global Wellness Guide, Gu Yunshang)

00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:42.910
Done.

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:44.380
Good.

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:47.230
Once you've signed it,
it's a collectible.

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:49.140
It's fine if I don't read it.

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:54.030
That works too.

00:13:57.660 --> 00:13:58.660
Right.

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:05.830
That sounds like my daughter.

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:08.020
What's she doing here
in the middle of the night?

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:11.260
She's here to look for my neighbor.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:12.260
My neighbor's a woman.

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:16.310
I should hide.

Dao is waiting for us at home.

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:23.500
He's been so well-behaved lately.

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:24.620
No idea why.

00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:26.230
He's super sweet.

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:29.780
Is the hallway his too?

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:35.710
What are you doing here?

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:38.740
I'm drinking tea, reading,
and keeping a fish.

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.860
I scooped it at the night market
just now.

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:48.740
Amazing, right?

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:49.580
Yeah.

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:51.860
Why didn't you scoop one more?

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:53.620
It's lonely.

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:56.780
You don't know
how hard it is to get one.

00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:57.990
Then buy another.

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:15.620
Does this hurt?

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:17.100
Bearable.

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:19.910
Here?

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:20.950
A little.

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:25.550
Here?

00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:26.550
No.

00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:27.790
And here?

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:29.310
No.

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:31.380
Rare to see you actually fall sick.

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:34.070
Am I serious? Do I need surgery?

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:35.380
Mild stomach flu.

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:37.470
Just take some stomach meds
and antibiotics.

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:41.020
What did you eat last night?

00:15:42.151 --> 00:15:44.662
Xia Xiaoman bought me xiaolongbao
the day before yesterday.

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:46.780
Did you put them in the fridge?

00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:48.310
I did.

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:50.430
Good thing I only ate one.

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:53.780
I love xiaolongbao.

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:55.470
Delicious.

Wait.

Your dad ate nineteen.

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:00.260
He must be nineteen times worse than me.

00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:09.590
The number you've dialed is powered off.

His phone's off.

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:12.470
I know which hotel he's staying in.

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:13.950
- Take me there.
- Okay.

Are you okay?

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:40.910
Same as me.

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:52.780
Your phone didn't charge at all.

00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:56.590
Sit down.

00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:57.950
Are you okay?

00:16:58.230 --> 00:16:59.140
I'm fine.

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:01.070
He ate my xiaolongbao.

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:02.380
I'll pay the medical bill.

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:03.260
No need.

Come to the hospital with me.

No, I'm not going.

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:09.390
Why are you so stubborn?

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:11.260
You two talk.

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:12.190

Me?

00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:20.950
What are you waving around for?

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:21.820
It's fine. Just leave.

00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:23.230
I'll go.

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:26.860
I'll go.

Why drag me along?

00:17:42.262 --> 00:17:44.390
What if he suddenly needs
to use the toilet again?

00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:47.230
He's such trouble.

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:49.710
You gave me

As the saying goes,
"A little dirt never hurt anyone."

- Shut up.

Yes, shut up.

Okay.

How can you talk to your dad like that?

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:05.870
No manners.

00:18:06.173 --> 00:18:07.540
No wonder you're still single.

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:08.750
Right.

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:11.260

would kick you out of the house.

I want to kick you two out now.

What did you say?

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:38.740
He was embarrassed to tell you,

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:39.990
so he asked me to say it.

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:43.230
I didn't ask you to say it
right in front of me.

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:45.260
Is that true?

- He's not talking about you.
- I know.

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.900
(Outpatient, Health Management Centre)

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:22.670
It's done, Dr. Gu.

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:24.580
Thank you.

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:28.260
Can I go now?

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.340
Wait. Let him take his meds first.

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:33.390
I need your ridiculous reasoning
to deal with his nonsense.

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:34.950
That's a folk proverb.

00:19:34.951 --> 00:19:37.239
Spring makes you sleepy, autumn
makes you tired, summer makes you doze,

00:19:37.239 --> 00:19:38.430
and you can't wake up in winter.

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:39.820
That's a thousand years of wisdom.

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:42.990
Won't wake up the entire year?
What wisdom is that?

00:19:43.862 --> 00:19:45.884
- Why are you laughing?
- Why are you laughing?

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:49.500
Jia,

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:52.670
will you come to my wedding?

00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:54.910
I have plans.

00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:56.430
Let's talk another day.

00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:00.300
She's angry.

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:01.470
She is.

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:02.740
Can I go now?

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:03.580
No.

00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:06.390
Give me some advice.

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:08.470
Advice?

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:10.180
Okay.

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:12.110
May you be blessed
with many children. See you.

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:19.840
Alright.

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.950
After over a month
of revisions and design,

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:23.540
we've solved the problem.

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:24.580
Please take a look.

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:26.150
According to the original layout,

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:27.710
we kept both bathrooms

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:28.630
in our design.

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:30.470
But we added storage space

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:32.340
inside one of them.

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:33.340
That way,

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:35.190
you get two bathrooms

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:37.150
and storage.

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:38.630
Here's the render.

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:40.870
This is the storage area.

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:41.710
And in this picture,

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:44.020
behind the sliding door
is the storage room.

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:45.500
When the door is closed,

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:46.740
you can't see anything.

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:48.670
Two bathrooms are better.

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:51.150
The design also suits
the two elderly people's request

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:52.780
for the storage room.

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:54.710
Mr. Yu, thank you so much.

00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:57.150
Meeting such complicated needs

00:20:57.150 --> 00:20:58.390
isn't easy.

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:00.150
No big deal.

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:01.550
In the end,

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:03.820
it's just the two of you living there.

00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:08.070
Right.

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:11.150
If you can afford one apartment,
you can afford two.

00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:14.230
Right.

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:15.910
Wish you both success

00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:16.780
and prosperity.

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:18.390
And may you two live long and healthy.

00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:31.990
Please come in.

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:36.630
Jia.

00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:39.190
Dad. Why aren't you
resting in your ward?

00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:40.230
What are you doing here?

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:44.540
Your shift ends at midnight.

00:21:44.706 --> 00:21:45.995
I was worried you'd get hungry,

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:47.670
so I brought you some food.

00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:50.710
I'm not hungry.

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:56.710
Are you angry?

00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:58.060
Why would I be?

00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:02.150
I know

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:04.580
you've been mad at me.

00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:08.710
You resent me
for not treating your mom well.

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:11.580
Even for betraying her.

00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:16.190
I never thought you betrayed her.

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:20.060
I thought you forgot her.

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:24.430
After she passed away,

00:22:24.973 --> 00:22:26.706
there were several times I went home

00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:28.580
and no one was there.

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:31.870
I knew where Mom had gone,

00:22:32.284 --> 00:22:33.870
but I didn't know where you went.

00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:36.340
I feel like

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:38.430
after Mom was gone,

00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:39.630
our home fell apart.

00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:41.230
No.

00:22:43.551 --> 00:22:45.306
I didn't have a home anymore.

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:51.500
Jia, fifteen years ago,

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:53.300
you went abroad to study.

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:54.820
Ten years ago,

00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:58.710
your mom passed away.

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:02.020
Whenever I missed you two,

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:03.740
I'd go out for a walk.

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:05.580
After she passed,

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:07.260
you became like a different person.

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:09.470
Sometimes, I felt like

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:12.910
you were happier
than when she was alive.

00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:15.540
Do you know why I refuse blind dates?

00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:17.780
Because I saw

00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:20.990
you two live a whole life together,

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:23.740
and then when one leaves,

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:26.540
the other turns around

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:28.300
and acts like nothing happened.

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:30.950
What's the point of marriage then?

00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:38.780
Family love is
the most meaningful thing.

00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:42.020
Your mom

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:44.540
only made a few dishes

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:46.500
in her whole life.

00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:33.820
Do they taste like her cooking?

00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:44.340
Yes.

00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:46.340
See?

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:51.390
I remember the taste of her cooking.

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:53.300
How could I ever forget her?

00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:03.790
Dad.

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:07.950
I misunderstood you.

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:13.950
Let me keep you company.

00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:15.910
I'll sit beside you.

00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:24.660
Dad,

00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:26.300
it's late.

00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:28.100
Where did you get all these dishes?

00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:29.990
No.

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:31.780
They were made

00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:33.630
by Yu Yu.

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:35.150
Yu Yu?

00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:37.870
He wouldn't cook at first.

00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:40.740
I told him it wasn't for me.

00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:43.910
These are the dishes Jia's mom
made for her when she was little.

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:48.020
He made them right away
without saying anything.

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:06.700
(Art of Language)

00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:13.390
Can I ask you something?

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:15.180
Dad,

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:22.100
I'll attend

00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:24.390
your wedding.

00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:28.580
Sure.

00:26:31.806 --> 00:26:33.780
Hurry and eat up.

00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:35.300
They're getting cold.

00:26:38.306 --> 00:26:39.706
The doctor is about to do rounds.

00:26:39.751 --> 00:26:41.390
I'd better get back now.

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:50.740
(Mom)

00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:54.190
Mom...

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:56.060
Dad...

00:26:58.710 --> 00:26:59.780
He didn't forget you.

00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:04.340
He brought me four dishes just now.

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:08.390
Those you used to cook.

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:13.540
They had the same taste as yours.

00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:16.100
But he didn't cook them.

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:19.340
It was someone named Yu Yu.

00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:23.710
I haven't told you about him yet.

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:27.780
Can you come into my dream tonight?

00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:32.390
I want to tell you about him.

00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:34.670
(Yu Yu)

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:37.430
(is a quirky man.)

00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:40.150
(Just like Dad.)

00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:43.430
(He comes to bother me all the time,)

00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:46.060
(and I always talk him down.)

00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:51.710
Was Dad like this when he was young?

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:54.060
How did you deal with him?

00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:56.020
Can you teach me?

00:27:58.150 --> 00:27:59.580
We're all doing fine.

00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:01.390
Don't worry.

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:04.340
I'm going to eat now.

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.870
Are you going to your dad's wedding?

00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:33.540
Why are you wearing such a red outfit?

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:36.630
It's just a coat.

00:28:37.670 --> 00:28:38.870
What's that got to do with you?

00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:41.340
So what brings you here?

00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:43.740
A gift from my dad.

00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:45.510
Thank you.

00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:51.670
How's the bride?

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:54.140
She's nice.

00:28:54.373 --> 00:28:55.820
Her temper's a lot like my dad's.

00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:59.710
If you accidentally get married,

00:28:59.870 --> 00:29:02.390
your husband will have to deal with
a stubborn father-in-law

00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:04.580
and an equally stubborn mother-in-law.

00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:05.299
So?

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:07.100
So it'll be impossible for you
to get married.

00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:08.340
What's that got to do with you?

00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:09.180
Bye.

00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:10.940
I...

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:21.300
Hello.

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:23.630
Your outfit looks great!

00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:25.100
You know how to talk.

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:27.230
Unlike some people...

00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:33.540
The red envelope.
I was going to pretend I forgot,

00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:34.870
but you personally came.

00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:36.870
I'm not here for the money.

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:38.300
So I don't need to give it.

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:39.500
Thank you. Good night.

00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:42.550
Good night.

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:49.950
Don't you think
he's a bit like your dad?

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:52.710
They're birds of a feather.

00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:54.580
If my dad takes him in as a godson,

00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:56.020
I won't even be surprised.

00:29:57.950 --> 00:29:59.630
If that happens,

00:29:59.630 --> 00:30:01.500
you'll have to call him brother.

00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:03.430
I call him that?

00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:04.830
Hey!

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:33.780
I'm not getting you another fish.

00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:36.340
It'll fight with you
over food and oxygen.

00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:38.300
And the tank will be overcrowded.

00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:40.470
It's better to stay single.

00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:42.540
Be good.

00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:53.500
Mr. Zhang,
you're a well-organized person.

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:54.340
Thank you.

00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:55.780
This booklet

00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:57.910
really has a sense of ceremony.

00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:00.910
Your dad told me to make it.

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:02.870
He said you read
a lot of medical records,

00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:05.630
so this booklet might win you over.

00:31:08.390 --> 00:31:10.340
But here's a suggestion.

00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:13.260
Don't use these kinds of photos
for your next blind date.

00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:15.950
It looks like
one of those romance scams.

00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:21.870
I mean the style.

00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:23.630
- Style.
- Okay.

00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:26.390
It says you started a business
this year.

00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:28.190
You opened a DIY dumpling shop.

00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:30.190
Right, this is a new shop.

00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:31.710
We have all kinds of dough and fillings.

00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:32.780
Customers can make

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:34.500
(DIY Dumpling House)
their own dumplings

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:36.100
according to their preferences.

00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:38.630
That's interesting.

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:39.710
How's the business?

00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:41.190
We just opened.

00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:42.390
Let's see how it goes.

00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:44.710
Are you usually busy, Dr. Gu?

00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:46.500
Since it's a private hospital,
not really.

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:47.820
We don't have that many patients.

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:50.340
Sorry.

00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:53.500
Hello?

00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:55.500
Hello, Jia? Are you free today?

00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:56.990
Let's get afternoon tea.

00:31:57.230 --> 00:31:58.230
Alright. I got it.

00:31:59.630 --> 00:32:00.500
There's an emergency.

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:01.710
I have to go back right away.

00:32:01.795 --> 00:32:03.470
When will we see each other next time?

00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:04.710
We'll talk about it next time.

00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:05.910
Okay.

00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:10.870
Oh, can you return my papers?

00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:12.580
I don't have it.

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:14.470
Your dad gave me a soft copy.

00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:16.500
He switched to digital now.

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:18.820
Right. He said it's easier
to send in bulk.

00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:23.630
Thank you. See you next time.

00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:24.820
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:39.780
Hello. Welcome.

00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:40.620
Come on in.

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:43.780
That's cute.

00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:44.870
Those slippers.

00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:47.100
The tail.

00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:52.390
Lately, I've been obsessed with
Hua Hua and Meng Lan,

00:32:52.390 --> 00:32:54.580
so I bought a lot of panda merch.

00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:56.390
If you like those slippers,

00:32:56.390 --> 00:32:57.740
I can give you a pair.

00:32:57.740 --> 00:32:58.820
Sure.

00:32:58.951 --> 00:33:00.430
Come on in. I'll get you some water.

00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:01.270
Sure.

00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:09.300
Jia,

00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:12.230
we're both girls,

00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:14.670
but my place
is full of dolls and makeup,

00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:17.820
and yours is full of books.

00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:20.580
Even a foreign language book.

00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:22.500
What language is this?

00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:24.100
Latin.

00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:27.300
I can do Latin dance,

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:28.540
but I can't read Latin.

00:33:28.551 --> 00:33:29.970
Honestly, I don't understand either.

00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:31.706
Some guy from my blind date
gave it to me.

00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:35.060
He gave you a book in Latin?

00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:36.500
What's he trying to show off?

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:37.390
Right?

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:39.950
Wow, so many.

00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:41.390
Thank you, Jia.

00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:43.820
I prepare the afternoon tea for us.

00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:49.500
Who's this?

00:33:49.662 --> 00:33:51.670
The guy I went on a blind date with
earlier today.

00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:53.020
He runs a dumpling shop.

00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:54.710
Dressed like that?

00:33:56.190 --> 00:34:00.020
So, what do you think of
this dumpling elite?

00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:03.060
He's okay,

00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:04.528
but we won't see each other again.

00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:05.950
Why not?

00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:07.820
He looks fine.

00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:10.020
He looks fine,

00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:13.390
but he isn't my cup of tea.

00:34:13.390 --> 00:34:14.700
And he can't take a joke.

00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:17.660
No sense of humor.

00:34:17.910 --> 00:34:20.020
Imagine us on a date.

00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:21.750
I talk a lot,

00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:23.350
and he gets none of my jokes.

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:24.750
I'd have to explain everything.

00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:25.590
So tiring.

00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:27.140
That being said,

00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:28.870
he's all right.

00:34:28.870 --> 00:34:30.417
His dumpling shop is worth visiting.

00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:34.830
This is for you.

00:34:34.830 --> 00:34:36.060
Thank you.

00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:40.100
"Sleeping Beauty", "Mulan",

00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:41.950
"Beauty and the Beast", "Cinderella",

00:34:41.950 --> 00:34:43.300
"Snow White",

00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:44.240
(The Princess Diaries)

00:34:44.350 --> 00:34:45.430
and "The Princess Diaries".

00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:48.390
These were all my favorites
when I was little.

00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:49.700
Thank you.

00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:52.540
I've kept those for a really long time.

00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:54.100
This is a precious gift.

00:34:54.910 --> 00:34:56.990
Congrats on finding someone
who knows you.

00:34:57.180 --> 00:34:58.700
We'll watch them together.

00:34:58.700 --> 00:34:59.870
Great.

00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:01.660
Xiaoman, come here.

00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:05.220
See if there's anything you like.

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:08.580
I've watched this one.

00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:09.620
And this one.

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:12.620
You have this?

00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:13.840
"Little Women."

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:15.750
Yeah. I just rented it.

00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:18.350
It's one of the few novels
I've actually read.

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:21.620
Marriage isn't the only destination
for a woman.

00:35:21.684 --> 00:35:23.573
It's also not the only place
they belong to.

00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:25.684
Why isn't "Little Women"
back on the shelf yet?

00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:26.950
Someone just borrowed it.

00:35:27.062 --> 00:35:29.706
I came every day asking for it,
but you never kept it for me.

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:33.180
A new one just came in.

00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:34.660
You should just buy it.

00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:36.140
Cunning. I'm not buying.

00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:37.140
I'll give you a discount.

00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:39.110
How much?

00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:41.128
Don't talk about money. Talk about fate.

00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:42.270
Let's make friends.

00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:43.580
400 yuan.

00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:44.660
Shameless.

00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:47.830
I suddenly realized

00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:50.060
that I've known you for so long,

00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:52.910
but I've never heard your love story.

00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:55.750
There's nothing much

00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:57.580
to share.

00:35:58.950 --> 00:35:59.950
It's pretty simple.

00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:05.020
I used to have a serious boyfriend.

00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:06.270
We even got engaged.

00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:08.950
Later, he planned to go abroad

00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:11.620
and asked me to drop everything here
and go with him.

00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.990
I refused,

00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:13.950
and we broke up.

00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:19.350
What a shame that it ended
because of the long distance.

00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:21.750
I used to

00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:23.660
think that too.

00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:26.580
But later, I realized

00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:29.350
our values were completely different.

00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:32.700
What mattered to him

00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:34.620
meant nothing to me.

00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:37.700
And what mattered to me

00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:39.750
was worthless to him.

00:36:43.862 --> 00:36:46.262
So I didn't have the confidence
that we'd make it to the end.

00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:51.830
That's deep.

00:36:57.020 --> 00:36:58.140
What's on your mind?

00:36:59.910 --> 00:37:01.310
Something important to my life.

00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:05.580
What toxic article
did you read this time?

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:07.540
You're actually reflecting on life now.

00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:13.750
I don't know what my goal is.

00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:16.660
I don't know what I want.

00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:19.950
I don't know what I'm good at.

00:37:22.990 --> 00:37:24.500
Whenever Xia Xiaoman starts thinking,

00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:25.990
God laughs.

00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:27.830
Your goal

00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:29.830
is to find a reliable man.

00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:34.470
For income,

00:37:34.830 --> 00:37:36.580
don't insist on a car and a house.

00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:39.020
Someone who hits the average salary
in Shanghai

00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:39.950
will do.

00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:43.830
What's the average salary in Shanghai?

00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:46.790
79,610.

00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:49.140
That's a lot.

00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:52.140
About 6,600 yuan a month.

00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:53.350
That's the 2022 data.

00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:55.390
Not even

00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:57.140
eighty thousand a year.

00:37:57.140 --> 00:37:58.700
I make way more than that.

00:37:58.830 --> 00:38:00.220
Exactly.

00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:01.620
I can't settle for that.

00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:04.580
I should find someone financially free.

00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:09.700
But how much does it take
to be financially free?

00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:11.020
Nineteen million.

00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:12.230
Nineteen million...

00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:13.470
Did you hear that?

00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:14.620
Nineteen million.

00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:15.790
Yes, I heard.

00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:17.270
Fine. I give up.

00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:18.140
You guys talk.

00:38:18.151 --> 00:38:19.620
I'm going inside to look at hot guys.

00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:26.500
What am I supposed to do?

00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:29.990
Men over fifty who make a million a year

00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:32.017
are three times as many
as those in their thirties.

00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:33.328
Single men are harder to find.

00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:36.540
It's easier with widowers
or divorced ones.

00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:39.180
What are you on about?

00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:41.430
Why would I find an old man?

00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:43.020
And can you stop

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:44.990
raining on my parade?

00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:47.060
Say something I want to hear.

00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:49.150
Fine.

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:51.270
You spend a hundred yuan on a manicure.

00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:54.417
If you convert it, that's a place
worth a million per square meter.

00:38:54.830 --> 00:38:56.060
You're rich yourself.

00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:18.460
(Good luck with a smooth start!)

00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:20.020
Sun, the door frame is crooked.

00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:22.470
Crooked? It's straight.

00:39:23.310 --> 00:39:25.830
Why does it feel like you
purposely mess something up

00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:27.620
just so I'll argue with you?

00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:28.990
Can you beat me?

00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:30.470
I'm too lazy to fight you.

00:39:30.830 --> 00:39:33.270
Do you think he can beat me, Wu?

00:39:35.310 --> 00:39:36.150
Excuse me.

00:39:36.430 --> 00:39:37.270
Excuse me.

00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:38.580
I live next door.

00:39:38.830 --> 00:39:41.270
Your sawdust has been flying
into my place.

00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:42.940
Sawdust?

00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:44.990
Apologize to him.

00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:53.270
I'm sorry.

00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:55.020
Next time I cut wood,

00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:56.390
I'll close the window.

00:39:57.540 --> 00:39:59.180
Yes, pay attention to it.

00:39:59.470 --> 00:40:00.310
I'm so sorry.

00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:07.790
He's being dramatic.

00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:09.220
It's just some sawdust.

00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:10.310
Why make a fuss?

00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:11.430
So dramatic.

00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:13.830
What do you mean by "dramatic"?

00:40:13.884 --> 00:40:15.310
That window is right by the kitchen.

00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:16.180
When I cook,

00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:17.470
your sawdust falls into my food.

00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:18.870
How am I supposed to eat?

00:40:23.470 --> 00:40:24.350
Apologize.

00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:29.180
I'm sorry. We didn't think
you could hear us.

00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:30.310
What do you mean?

00:40:30.310 --> 00:40:32.860
You think it'd be fine to talk
behind my back if I didn't hear you?

00:40:32.862 --> 00:40:33.551
You're so rude.

00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:36.790
Apologize to him.

00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:41.700
Sorry. We'll be more careful.

00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:44.020
Can you be sincere?

00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:47.060
How? How much more sincere
do you want me to be?

00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:48.270
I already apologized.

00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:49.990
I said I'd close the window.

00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:50.773
Stop nitpicking.

00:40:50.773 --> 00:40:52.700
You walked in,
saying the door frame is crooked.

00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:53.420
How is it crooked?

00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:55.680
If I say it's crooked, it's crooked.
You dare argue with me?

00:40:55.684 --> 00:40:57.328
- Measure it yourself.
- You measure.

00:40:57.351 --> 00:41:00.270
Don't fight.

00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:06.860
Oh no!

00:41:08.350 --> 00:41:10.180
Sir, did you get punched in the nose?

00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:12.100
He did it. Not me.

00:41:14.350 --> 00:41:15.750
Not me. It was him.

00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:22.310
Luckily, it's not bleeding.

00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:23.310
Tell me about it.

00:41:23.310 --> 00:41:25.470
If he calls the police, it's trouble.

00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:27.580
It was Sun.

00:41:27.728 --> 00:41:28.950
I saw it with my own eyes.

00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:30.580
You swung right at his face.

00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:31.750
- You saw it?
- Are you sure?

00:41:31.751 --> 00:41:32.470
I am.

00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:33.580
Who do you trust, me or him?

00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:34.750
Stop blaming others, will you?

00:41:34.750 --> 00:41:35.610
You trust him?

00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:36.500
You should apologize.

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:37.580
You go.

00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:39.595
I went but he didn't accept it.

00:41:39.617 --> 00:41:41.620
He went to complain
to the management office.

00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:42.990
Are we still taking this job or not?

00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:44.350
I hate people who file complaints.

00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:45.430
Childish.

00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:46.870
Like a kid who gets hit,

00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:48.910
runs home to his mummy crying.

00:41:48.973 --> 00:41:50.700
You've received four complaints
this month.

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:52.817
The fruit stall downstairs
is blocking the blind path.

00:41:52.817 --> 00:41:54.110
That's the public spirit, okay?

00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:56.870
That's the dumpling shop.

00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:58.240
He spends most of his time there.

00:41:58.306 --> 00:41:59.140
(DIY Dumpling House)

00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:00.390
What kind of shop is this?

00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:02.140
It's not run by a normal person.

00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:04.790
Getting Mr. Yu to apologize
is impossible.

00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:05.910
Because I didn't hit him!

00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:07.380
- Are you going or not?
- No.

00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:10.870
Going or not?

00:42:17.950 --> 00:42:19.060
Fine.

00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:20.270
I'll go.

00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:21.220
Right now!

00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:22.060
Fine!

00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:25.220
(Yichu Era Decoration Group)

00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:27.020
Yu Yu's here, Mr. Li.

00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:28.540
Let him in.

00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:29.380
Okay.

00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:34.990
Hello, Mr. Li.

00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:36.870
Hello, Mr. Yu.

00:42:36.906 --> 00:42:39.928
I want to check the security footage
of the construction site. Send it to me.

00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:43.100
You need that to file a complaint?

00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:47.390
I need to find the real culprit.
