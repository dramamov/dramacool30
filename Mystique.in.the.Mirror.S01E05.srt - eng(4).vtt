00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.380
Have you known a guy named Win?

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.080
Is he a friend of yours?

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.630
He comes to see me all the time,

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:16.420
But I still have no idea

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:17.710
how he truly feels about me.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.080
Your favorite type

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.130
have never escaped my keen eyes.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.830
Pete the new nurse, right?

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:24.960
The hospital rules:

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.540
You mustn't go out alone at night.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:29.210
Someone will come.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.670
You better tell me

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.290
who that nurse ghost was.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.830
Are you sure

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.960
you have never seen her before?

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.630
Hello, Mr.Alan.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.500
Hello, Mr.Alan.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.710
Hello, Mr.Alan.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.380
Hello, Mr.Alan.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.789
Hello, Mr.Alan.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.880
Hello, Mr.Alan.

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.080
Hello, Mr.Alan.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.079
Hello, Mr.Alan.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:20.750
Mr.Alan.

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:21.790
Mr. Alan.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.040
Mr. Alan.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.880
The patient is in a critical state.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.500
Hurry up, follow me.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Hurry.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.380
Remember.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:01.710
Come back to me.

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:02.540
Remember.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:03.790
Come back.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.080
Remember.

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.290
- Remember.
- Leave me alone.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.330
Remember.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.130
Remember.

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.830
Remember.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:10.750
Remember.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.250
Remember.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:13.460
Come back to me.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.500
Remember.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:15.960
Remember.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.420
Remember.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.420
Come back to me.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.540
Remember.

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:21.829
Come back to me.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.329
Remember!

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:49.790
Pete?

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.500
Easy, Alan.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:04.580
Drink plenty of water.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.460
You were likely dehydrated

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.080
so you passed out.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:19.130
Easy there.

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:24.710
Alan.

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.380
What were you doing on
the third-floor staircase?

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.040
What were you doing up there?

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:31.170
Third floor?

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.580
I followed the nurse
into that room too.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.960
Alan, listen to me.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.210
You have a problem
with memorization.

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.710
Maybe you'd left that room,

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.420
but you just couldn't remember?

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.750
Remember.

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:50.790
Come back to me.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.500
Remember.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:55.330
Pete.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.170
Would you promise me

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.250
not to tell Doctor
Nil about this?

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.210
I don't want this
to be a big deal.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.630
Please, Pete.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:14.580
I'm sorry, Alan.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.130
I really can't
make that promise.

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.500
This is an important matter,

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.250
especially for yourself.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.500
You have a memory problem,

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:25.580
and you go lost too.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.000
Not to mention the
hallucinations you had.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.960
But I trusted you,

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:33.960
that's why I told you everything.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.580
And you've promised me too.

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:44.880
Reporting this matter to Doctor Nil

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.630
would be more beneficial for you.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:04.580
Now excuse me.

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.040
Don't forget to
drink lots of water.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.790
Pete said he found me at the staircase.

00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:59.960
Am I supposed to
believe that was real?

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.580
I'm starting to doubt what
was real and what wasn't.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.790
And was everything
I've written the truth?

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:08.670
I know there's something going on,

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:11.710
but they just
didn't let me know.

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:19.750
Attention-

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:20.750
Blue code-

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:22.670
Room C02.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:23.880
Repeat.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.000
Blue code-

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.790
Room C02.

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:28.080
Attention-

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.080
Blue code-

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:30.920
Room C02.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.710
Are you conscious?

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:39.920
Attention-

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:40.960
Blue code-

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.630
Room C02.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.000
Repeat

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.040
Blue code

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:45.580
Room C02

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:46.960
Again, push harder.

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:49.540
Bring in the ventilator!

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:50.920
I'll take it from here.

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:52.630
Sir.

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:53.830
Sir!

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:57.920
Attention-

00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:58.960
Blue code

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.580
Room C02.

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:02.500
Repeat-

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:03.630
Blue code-

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:05.290
Room C02.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:06.920
Attention-

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:07.920
Blue code-

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.920
Room C02.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Sir.

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:23.130
Sir!

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.830
Keep going.

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:41.289
That's enough.

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:56.830
Time of death, 11:42 PM.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:07.380
What are you doing in here?

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.460
Is he really dead?

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:21.170
I think you should leave.

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:38.960
You can't just wandered
in there like that.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.000
If Doctor Nil had
been in that room,

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:42.880
you would have been
in even more trouble.

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:45.500
No,

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:46.710
I wasn't wandering around.

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:48.460
I heard the announcement

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.130
and wanted to know what
was going on with him.

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:52.750
On the other day,

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.170
I was brought to
that room by a nurse.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.080
A nurse?

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.500
Did you mean that night

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.040
I found you infront
of that room?

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:10.130
Have you still been
thinking about it?

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:13.290
It's not like that, Pete.

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:15.210
It was yesterday

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:17.710
that you told me you found
me passed out on the staircase.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:19.960
Alan.

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:21.420
It wasn't yesterday,

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.460
but two days ago

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000
that I found you.

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:27.130
Two days ago.

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:28.540
Huh?

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:31.170
Alan.

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:34.250
I think you got mixed up.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:38.500
I'm not.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.750
I was just here yesterday.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.250
I also came here that night.

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:47.830
I think there must be something

00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:49.170
between me

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:50.830
and room C02 for sure.

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:04.420
What's going on?

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:11.420
Pete,

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:12.960
what are you doing here?

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.920
Currently, your memory pattern is

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:25.540
1, 3, 5, 4 and 2.

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:27.330
even though it should have been

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:29.830
1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:33.380
Doctor.

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:35.000
But

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:38.250
I'm sure it wasn't like that.

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:40.500
I'm sure I didn't get it wrong.

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:43.210
When we memorize things,

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.690
it will break down into
scenarios

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:47.750
and sub-scenarios.

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:49.960
The content in the memory

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:51.880
is the core of the memory.

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:53.670
That's why it made you

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:56.750
think you met Pete yesterday,

00:12:57.830 --> 00:12:59.380
when you actually met
him two days earlier.

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:01.630
Or when you

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:03.170
falsely remembered
the meal you had

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:05.130
with the meal on the other day.

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:06.540
Remember.

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:08.420
With the meal on the other day.

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:13.170
Alan.

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:15.630
But, doctor.

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:18.880
That doesn't seem right.

00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:22.460
What makes you

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:23.710
so sure?

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:25.960
You're not listening to me.

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:30.040
I've been led to the
room several times.

00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:33.290
And today, someone
died in that room too.

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.710
Don't you think everything
has some sort of connection?

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:40.210
Currently,

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:43.710
the problem isn't
just about the memory.

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:47.630
You also suffer from a condition

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.830
where your brain interprets
images you're seeing

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:51.330
incorrectly.

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:55.880
Do you remember
when Doctor Nil explained

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:57.750
that you

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.080
had brain hallucinations issue?

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:02.330
Can you remember?

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:07.420
Can you remember?

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:15.330
Let me ask you straight.

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:16.880
Are you still

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:19.170
practicing looking at the cards nowadays?

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:21.380
You must do it, it's
for your own sake.

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:23.000
Remember.

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:26.460
Nobody has ever
believed what I think is true.

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:28.130
What about everyone's
efforts to help you?

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:29.580
They never meant
anything to you?

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:31.790
Are you sure

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:34.710
you have never seen that nurse before?

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:36.420
Remember.

00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:38.250
Come back to me.

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:42.380
Yesterday

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:44.710
that you said you found me
passed out on the staircase.

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:46.080
But it was two days ago.

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:47.630
Remember.

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:49.920
Remember.

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:53.420
Remember!

00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.080
No matter how much I
practice looking at the pictures,

00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:00.380
nothing changes.

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:02.000
Nothing has gotten better!

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:05.170
You know what?

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:06.790
If you have some free time,

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:09.580
you should practice looking
at those cards as well.

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:12.380
So you'd understand how
to properly treat the patient.

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:17.170
Doc.

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:19.460
I think we should
leave him alone first.

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.420
They've probably
moved the corpse.

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:52.210
judging by how well
the bed was made.

00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:54.750
You said he had been
here for a long time.

00:15:57.330 --> 00:15:58.750
What was his mental disorder?

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:00.420
Well

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:01.880
I don't know either.

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:05.130
When I first saw him,

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:08.170
he was already in a
vegetative state like this.

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:10.000
Hadn't any

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.290
of his family

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:16.830
or anyone else
come to visit him?

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:26.290
I've never seen anyone else but
the doctors come into this room.

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:30.380
I told you

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:33.710
this place was a
hospital of the forgotten.

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:36.790
Even as he was dying,

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:40.170
we still didn't see how he died.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.500
The only thing left to
see is an empty bed

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:49.080
that looks like no one
has ever been here before.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Win.

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:04.829
Am I

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:07.420
going to end up like him?

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:11.540
Huh?

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:24.500
You won't.

00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:30.790
But ever since I've been here,

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.790
no one has ever
given me attention.

00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:36.920
Nobody has ever come to see me.

00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:41.000
My father doesn't
even come visit me.

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.290
I'm right here.

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:16.420
It's okay.

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:26.580
Thank you so much.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.000
You don't have to.

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:36.920
We promised

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:39.330
we would never leave each other.

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:41.540
I don't wanna be here anymore.

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:43.670
Please get me out of this place.

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.380
I don't want to get old and die here alone.

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:50.460
Please?

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:52.500
I beg you.

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:56.210
I really beg you.

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.210
You've promised

00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:03.790
you wouldn't leave me.

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:07.330
Right?

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:14.500
Right?

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:16.290
Mm-hmm.

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:19.790
But we must plan carefully.

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:27.460
Stop crying.

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:31.040
You too.

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:10.920
Hey, you.

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:14.000
You should throw that
in the washing machine.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.420
It's just an ink stain,

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:19.080
hand wash should be enough.

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:21.500
Okay.

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:23.420
This is kinda funny.

00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:25.630
You used to be the one who consoled me.

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:26.790
Now, it's my turn.

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:29.170
Come on, let me comfort you.

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:30.460
Come quickly.

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:40.210
Oh!

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.040
Your shirt is torn.

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:44.210
Huh?

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:46.080
On the shoulder.

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:47.210
Oh.

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:49.670
It's nothing, I can fix it.

00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:50.920
Ain't a big deal.

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:56.540
I think that shirt's been
through a lot of hardships.

00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:58.130
You should buy a new one.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.170
I'd rather not, Doc.

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:01.830
That would be a waste of money.

00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:08.420
Alright.

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:24.920
I gotta go now.

00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:26.830
Okay.

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:27.790
Hey!

00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:30.710
Look over here.

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:33.040
Your pants are ripped.

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.170
Oh, the hole is big too.

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:41.960
Have you got a spare outfit?

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:44.130
I have.

00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:46.130
Let's go then.

00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:47.580
I'll take you to change.

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:48.880
Come.

00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:51.210
Everyone else's going to
notice that your pants are ripped.

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:52.670
Hurry.

00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:59.500
Want me to help you pick?

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.130
What are you staring at?

00:22:58.710 --> 00:22:59.920
I noticed you're slowing down.

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:01.540
Are you shy?

00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:03.830
Or do you need me to
help you with changing?

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:08.960
No, I'm

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.130
I'm changing right now.

00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:16.210
Or should I go wait for you outside?

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:20.710
Got it.

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:22.960
I'll go wait outside then.

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:37.920
I need to borrow
this for a while, Doc.

00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:40.210
I'll pay you back when I can.

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:47.080
Here, take this.

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:49.790
This bag?

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:45.130
Are you sure?

00:25:57.210 --> 00:25:58.000
Hurry up!

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:20.080
You said you wouldn't peek.

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:21.880
Who peeked?

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:25.130
I was staring at how
sluggish you were.

00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:27.630
Just say you love it.

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:31.460
Nonsense.

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:49.040
What?

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:53.500
Come here.

00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:55.210
You mis-buttoned your shirt.

00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:57.210
Oops.

00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:03.290
How old are you?

00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:04.960
Look, this button.

00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:19.170
Do I look handsome?

00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:20.000
You do.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.000
Let's go.

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:24.960
Get up there, quick.

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:30.830
I'll go first.

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:36.210
Careful.

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:45.960
Come, I'll pull you up.

00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:55.170
Slowly.

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:09.080
Are you ready?

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:16.290
What are you so confused about?

00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:17.330
Quick, before someone sees us.

00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:27.630
I'm not dreaming, am I?

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:33.040
What's next for us?

00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:46.290
Quick, hitch a ride.

00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:07.040
Over here.

00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:08.080
Over here.

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:09.500
We need a ride.

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:12.290
I don't wanna be here anymore.

00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:13.830
Please get me out of this place.

00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:16.580
But we must plan carefully.

00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:19.420
Thank you so much.

00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:22.580
You don't have to.

00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:25.420
We promised

00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:27.750
we would never leave each other.

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:31.920
Over here.

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:32.750
We're going with you.

00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:34.290
" Stop "

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:45.670
Hey.

00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:46.920
So where should we go next?

00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:50.290
I have no idea.

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:54.460
Why did you take me on
this bus in the first place?

00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:56.250
All I could think was
that we ought to get out

00:29:56.290 --> 00:29:58.000
of the hospital area
as fast as possible.

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:05.460
What do we do now?

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:08.080
Yeah.

00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:10.920
Do you have plans
to go somewhere?

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:19.750
So...

00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:21.630
You escaped from the hospital,

00:30:21.670 --> 00:30:23.580
but you haven't got any plans?

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.210
Nothing you wanted to do?

00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:27.630
No where you wanted to go?

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:30.960
I know that my memory
isn't working properly.

00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:33.170
Don't go harsh on me yet.

00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:35.290
Can you believe this?

00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:38.710
Shouldn't have
brought this to myself.

00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:40.580
Hey.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.710
What day is today?

00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:44.790
Saturday.

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:46.000
Why?

00:30:46.290 --> 00:30:47.630
What time might it be now?

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:55.130
Around 4.00 PM, I guess.

00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:57.380
Can we travel to somewhere near Rangsit Khlong 12?

00:30:57.790 --> 00:30:59.250
I have a friend named Nate.

00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:00.290
He should be able to help us.

00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:05.670
Are you sure

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:08.330
your friend won't send
us back to the hospital?

00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:09.210
I'm sure.

00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:10.790
That's my best friend.

00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:15.330
He once mentioned that he
liked to play music at the market.

00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:17.330
At this time,

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:19.290
we might be able to find him there.

00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:22.460
Fine.

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:23.580
We'll go meet your friend.

00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:32.000
Here, for two person.

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:40.500
Where to next?

00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:43.670
I don't remember.

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:45.580
I didn't write that
down in here either.

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:50.080
But something might
come up while we're walking.

00:31:52.790 --> 00:31:54.500
So tired,

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:55.920
I need a break.

00:31:57.540 --> 00:31:58.540
Where should we sit?

00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:01.130
Hey.

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:04.380
See the ice cream
shop over there?

00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:07.380
I remember eating
it, and it was delicious.

00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:09.750
You wanna eat?

00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:11.920
Let's go.

00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:26.380
You want some too?

00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:29.250
Fine, I'll eat it with you.

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:32.670
You wanted to eat too,
but you're just acting.

00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:40.380
I'd like a scoop of
ice cream in a cup

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:42.750
with sticky rice and corn for toppings.

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:43.580
Sure thing.

00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:46.040
I'll have the same.

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:48.500
Why did you copy me?

00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:50.580
I didn't copy.

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:52.630
Couples would have shared
the same thoughts, right?

00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:55.130
Hold up,

00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:58.330
since when did we
become a couple?

00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:00.540
Hold up,

00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:03.130
People who love each
other must become couples.

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:05.080
Hold up,

00:33:06.790 --> 00:33:08.500
when did I ever
tell you I loved you?

00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:11.040
Hold up,

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:12.710
you don't love me?

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:15.130
Stop saying "Hold up."

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:19.500
Thanks.

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:22.000
Sir.

00:33:22.170 --> 00:33:23.500
I ordered two cups.

00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:24.420
It's okay,

00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:25.580
I can share with you.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.000
Go.

00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:28.790
What's up with him?

00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:35.580
I'll give you the first bite.

00:33:44.170 --> 00:33:44.880
How was it?

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:46.330
Yummy.

00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:48.540
Go ahead,

00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:49.710
dig in.

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:51.710
He doesn't see us.

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:53.080
Don't do that.

00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:55.460
Hey!

00:33:56.170 --> 00:33:57.170
Someone's secretly
taking a picture of us.

00:34:00.210 --> 00:34:01.210
Hey there.

00:34:02.670 --> 00:34:03.920
It's okay, I'm not mad.

00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:06.040
I just would like
to request that

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:09.170
you take a picture
of the two of us.

00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:11.380
Please?

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:12.460
Just one picture.

00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:13.670
Of course.

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:15.960
Thank you.

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:20.040
You can stand right over there.

00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:27.500
1, 2, and 3.

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:35.420
Here.

00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:36.960
Thanks a lot.

00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:38.670
The picture printed
out right away?

00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:39.380
Yeah,

00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:40.580
We have to wait for a bit,

00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:41.580
and after some time passes,

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:42.880
the picture will
start getting clearer.

00:34:43.330 --> 00:34:44.710
Then we can just keep it.

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:47.920
Pretty cool.

00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:51.210
No idea what kind
of face I made.

00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:55.080
A nurse!

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:56.130
He's coming all the way here?

00:34:56.130 --> 00:34:56.830
Let's go.

00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:32.580
Your friend is really here?

00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:35.130
It's getting dark.

00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:37.000
Yeah, it's this place.

00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:38.380
Come.

00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:48.540
Alan.

00:35:49.330 --> 00:35:50.330
Hey!

00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:53.420
Nate.

00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:56.630
Long time no see, man.
ไม่ได้เจอกันนานเลยนะ

00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:00.380
Where have you been? You're father've been looking for you.
หายไปเลยนะ ไอ้ห่า พ่อมึงตามหาอยู่

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:01.920
I'm sorry, but I was sick.
กูขอโทษ กูไม่ค่อยสบายไง

00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:03.130
Remember?
ที่เคยบอกไป

00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:05.500
Is everything alright now?
ตอนนี้หายแล้วเหรอวะ

00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:07.580
Is your brain okay?
สมองมึงไม่เป็นไร ใช่ไหม

00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:13.080
It's been a long story.
เรื่องมันยาวว่ะ

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.000
Do you have time?
มึงมีเวลาป่ะล่ะ

00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:17.790
Always.
ได้เสมอ

00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:23.920
So, this must be Win.
งั้นนี่ก็คือวินสินะ

00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:27.710
Like "Winner", with the W?
เหมือนวินเนอร์เหรอ ขึ้นต้นด้วยตัวดับเบิ้ลยูเหรอ

00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:29.580
Yeah, Win.
ใช่ วิน

00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:31.080
Like a Winner.
เหมือนกับวินเนอร์

00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:32.830
What are your plans?
แล้วแผนมึงคืออะไรวะ

00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:35.750
That's why we came to see you.
นั่นคือเหตุผลที่กูมาหามึง

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:38.040
We don't know where to go next
พวกกูไม่รู้จะไปไหนต่อ

00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:40.420
and have no plan.
และไม่มีแผนอะไรเลย

00:36:41.290 --> 00:36:41.920
Alan.
อลัน

00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:44.460
Can I be honest with you?
กูถามมึงตรง ๆ ได้ไหม

00:36:45.130 --> 00:36:45.580
Yeah.
เออ

00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:48.210
Your condition...
มึงหนีออกมาแบบนี้

00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:52.420
will running away be bad for you?
แล้วอาการป่วยของมึงล่ะ

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:54.960
Look, man.
มึงดูกูดิ

00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:56.460
I'm fine.
กูปกติดี

00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:57.790
Do I look like a patient?
กูดูเหมือนคนป่วยเหรอ

00:36:58.920 --> 00:36:59.920
Yeah?
เออ

00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:01.210
Yeah, you look fine.
เออ มึงปกติดี

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:02.670
What about your dad?
แล้วพ่อมึงอะ

00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:04.670
Why don't you like, go back to him.
ทำไมมึงไม่กลับไปหาพ่อมึงวะ

00:37:05.210 --> 00:37:08.420
I'm sure he's heard from the hospital and is looking for you.
กูมั่นใจว่าโรงพยาบาลต้องบอกเขา และเขาก็จะตามหามึง

00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:10.540
He must be very worried.
เขาคงจะกังวลมาก

00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:13.330
I...
กู...

00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:16.920
I just don't want to see him right now.
กูไม่อยกาเจอเขาตอนนี้ว่ะ

00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:18.630
We just need a place to stay.
เราอยากกได้ที่พักสักที่

00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:21.290
Somewhere to hide.
ที่ที่เอาไว้ซ่อน

00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:23.000
And our money is limited.
แล้วเงินกูก็มีแบบจำกัดด้วย

00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:25.630
Please help us.
ขอร้องล่ะ ช่วยพวกกูเถอะ

00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:31.380
Uh...
เอ่อ...

00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:34.210
You know I'd love to help, right?
มึงรู้ใช่ไหมว่ากูชอบที่จะช่วย

00:37:35.330 --> 00:37:36.330
But
แต่

00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:38.630
I'm in the middle of moving to UK with my dad.
ช่วงนี้กูต้องเตรียมตัวย้ายไปที่อังกฤษกับพ่อ

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:41.290
And I'm currently staying with my mom and her family.
กูต้องย้ายมาอยู่กับแม่กูและญาติของเขาที่นี่

00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:44.710
If you were to come alone
ถ้ามึงมาคนเดียว

00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:47.170
there might be space, but...
มันก็มีที่พอ แต่...

00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:53.920
I'm so sorry, man.
กูขอโทษด้วยจริง ๆ

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:56.540
It's okay. You don't have to.
ไม่เป็นไร มึงไม่ต้องขอโทษ

00:37:57.540 --> 00:37:58.330
It's fine.
กูไม่เป็นไร

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.080
I do know a hotel. It's very cheap.

00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:03.460
Just across the road.
แค่ข้ามถนนไป

00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:06.420
On the... The room is what it is.
ห้องอะไรนั่น...

00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:07.790
So...
ก็...

00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:10.330
That's not a bad option.
เป็นตัวเลือกที่ไม่แย่

00:38:13.290 --> 00:38:14.290
It's okay.
ก็โอเค

00:38:15.130 --> 00:38:16.250
We're gonna look for it.
เดี๋ยวพวกกูไปหาดู

00:38:18.130 --> 00:38:19.830
Anyway, I'll be here tomorrow.
ยังไงพรุ่งนี้กูก็อยู่ที่นี่

00:38:20.170 --> 00:38:22.880
So, if you need to look for me. Please come.
ถ้ามึงจะมาหากู ก็มานะ

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.420
And I got to go.
แต่ตอนนี้กูต้องไปแล้ว

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.710
So it was really nice seeing you.

00:38:29.290 --> 00:38:30.960
And nice to meet you too.
และดีใจที่ได้รู้จักนายด้วยนะ

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:33.040
Come.
มา

00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:34.080
Come on.
มาเลย

00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:37.330
See you.
แล้วเจอกันมึง

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:38.960
Take care.
ดูแลตัวเองด้วยนะ

00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:42.670
See you.
เจอกัน

00:38:43.210 --> 00:38:43.880
Yeah.
เออ

00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:03.170
We're going to have
to spend the night here.

00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:07.250
In a few days,

00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:09.750
Nate might be able to
find us a better place.

00:39:15.290 --> 00:39:16.830
Can we really trust him?

00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:19.130
Sure, we can trust him.

00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:21.380
Nate's been my best
friend since my childhood.

00:39:21.830 --> 00:39:23.210
You sure he's just a friend?

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:29.880
Jealous?

00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:38.920
We're just friends.

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:39.790
Believe me.

00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:43.790
But the way you looked at each other

00:39:45.830 --> 00:39:46.830
didn't seem like friends.

00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:50.670
Alright.

00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:52.750
If you wanted to
know,

00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:54.130
then I'll be honest.

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:56.500
Nate

00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:58.250
is someone I really trusted.

00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:01.290
He helped me in find out

00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:03.000
my true interests.

00:40:05.330 --> 00:40:06.630
And he was also my first love.

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:10.920
I knew it.

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:14.250
But I no longer feel that
way with him anymore.

00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:17.000
Oh yeah?

00:40:18.330 --> 00:40:19.130
I don't buy it.

00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:21.630
Please believe me.

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:23.750
Why must I believe you?

00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:25.880
You just came to see him today.

00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:28.170
I came to see him because
I thought he could help us.

00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:29.830
I wasn't feeling anything
else with him.

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:33.380
Whatever.

00:40:35.170 --> 00:40:37.500
I just don't want anyone else
to matter more to you than I do.

00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:42.330
Hey.

00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:46.500
Nate may have been
someone special to me

00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:48.330
when I was a child,

00:40:51.330 --> 00:40:52.630
but he likes women.

00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:56.540
And ever since then,

00:40:57.170 --> 00:40:59.290
I have always kept
my distance from him.

00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:03.500
It wasn't the same
with you, though.

00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:09.540
How wasn't it the same?

00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:13.580
Do you know

00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:17.500
why I wanted to get out of the hospital?

00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:22.750
Why?

00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:26.290
I didn't want to
spend my life with you

00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:28.830
as patients in that hospital,

00:41:33.250 --> 00:41:35.170
but I wanted come out
and live my life with you

00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:38.750
as lovers,

00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:43.710
like normal people would.

00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:47.790
Like lovers?

00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:50.500
Yes.

00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:54.710
Are you confessing
your love for me?

00:41:56.330 --> 00:41:56.920
No?

00:41:57.170 --> 00:41:57.750
Who said that?

00:41:57.790 --> 00:41:58.790
I didn't say anything.

00:42:00.830 --> 00:42:01.830
Then

00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:06.330
I have the right to do
whatever lovers do, huh?

00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:11.130
What're you going to do?

00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:14.380
I mean...

00:42:19.630 --> 00:42:20.630
how are you going to do?

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:24.290
Like...

00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:29.790
something like this.

00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:33.420
Friends could also do that.

00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:34.460
Pretty normal.

00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:44.130
How about this?

00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:49.830
If the friends were close enough,

00:42:52.170 --> 00:42:53.170
it could be possible.

00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:33.080
How about this?

00:43:34.290 --> 00:43:35.670
How close would they have to be?

00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:37.420
Very, very close.

00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:55.920
Your hands are so naughty.

00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:58.960
Can't they be naughty?

00:44:06.170 --> 00:44:07.170
How naughty can they possibly be?

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:11.500
Let's find out.

00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:13.130
You're only mine.

00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:16.500
Yes.

00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:18.330
I'm all yours.

00:45:31.290 --> 00:45:32.080
You're awake?

00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:37.040
I'm going to get something to eat.

00:45:38.290 --> 00:45:38.960
Good idea.

00:45:56.210 --> 00:45:56.750
Alan.

00:45:57.500 --> 00:45:58.500
Run, hurry!

00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:11.580
Found him.

00:46:12.830 --> 00:46:14.000
- Let go!
- You're coming back.

00:46:14.130 --> 00:46:15.290
Come with us.

00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:16.080
Let go!

00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:17.000
Let go!

00:46:17.250 --> 00:46:17.710
Let go.

00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:18.500
Time to go back.

00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:19.460
Let go!

00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:20.420
Let me go!

00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:20.960
Come with us!
