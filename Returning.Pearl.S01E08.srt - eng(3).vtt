why don't you join us

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.809
The world of mortals

00:01:21.342 --> 00:01:22.747
Live a carefree and unrestrained life

00:01:22.906 --> 00:01:24.462
Jing Yuan, my good brother

00:01:24.764 --> 00:01:27.743
Come down and share the prosperity of the world with us

00:01:27.865 --> 00:01:28.603
yes

00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:58.356
Candlelight dinner prepared by my lady

00:01:58.598 --> 00:02:00.078
You are lucky, kid

00:02:02.923 --> 00:02:04.440
But this time has already arrived

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.751
Why doesn't Jing Yuan come here?

00:02:07.528 --> 00:02:08.647
Really naughty

00:02:15.712 --> 00:02:16.744
Pig time today

00:02:17.131 --> 00:02:18.872
I'll wait for you at the Spring Pavilion in the East Garden

00:02:27.721 --> 00:02:28.512
Adult Kei

00:02:30.277 --> 00:02:31.334
today

00:02:31.806 --> 00:02:33.553
It's your twentieth birthday

00:02:34.846 --> 00:02:36.147
in my time

00:02:36.638 --> 00:02:37.478
twenty years old

00:02:38.093 --> 00:02:39.693
This is a passionate age

00:02:41.316 --> 00:02:42.272
Not afraid of difficulties

00:02:42.297 --> 00:02:43.337
Dare to pursue your dreams

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.137
No question in the end

00:02:45.472 --> 00:02:46.671
Just ask sincerely

00:02:47.494 --> 00:02:49.059
But you are in this deep palace

00:02:49.084 --> 00:02:50.237
go through suffering

00:02:51.048 --> 00:02:52.009
Seal the heart and lock the love

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.062
I really feel unworthy for you

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.528
What nonsense is this girl talking about?

00:03:00.343 --> 00:03:00.994
no

00:03:01.145 --> 00:03:02.565
I can't be sarcastic

00:03:03.245 --> 00:03:05.353
I really feel sorry for your life experience

00:03:06.426 --> 00:03:08.553
After all, isn't this all my fault?

00:03:08.578 --> 00:03:09.219
No, no, no

00:03:09.244 --> 00:03:10.044
what to do

00:03:14.583 --> 00:03:15.759
But don't be afraid

00:03:16.025 --> 00:03:17.734
I will always be by your side

00:03:18.626 --> 00:03:19.431
because

00:03:20.002 --> 00:03:21.447
You are my hero

00:03:22.756 --> 00:03:23.944
your ending

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.989
I can only write it

00:03:27.925 --> 00:03:28.750
Yes

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:29.608
that's all

00:03:29.706 --> 00:03:30.490
That's right

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:46.310
adult

00:03:46.467 --> 00:03:47.269
I'm here

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:48.762
You all, please stand down.

00:03:51.462 --> 00:03:52.175
yes

00:04:02.854 --> 00:04:05.528
The human heart is dangerous and the road is weak.

00:04:11.456 --> 00:04:14.172
The breeze blows and the atmosphere is just right

00:04:18.468 --> 00:04:22.093
Wei Jing Wei Yi Yun Zhi Jue Zhong

00:04:22.228 --> 00:04:24.509
A birthday gift prepared by myself

00:04:25.464 --> 00:04:27.904
The iceberg will definitely melt tonight

00:04:28.537 --> 00:04:30.028
Taoism is the only one

00:04:31.312 --> 00:04:32.844
Taoism is the only one

00:04:39.474 --> 00:04:40.984
How can I say it?

00:04:41.392 --> 00:04:43.175
Is this my punishment?

00:05:02.567 --> 00:05:04.372
Why do you do this to me?

00:05:09.318 --> 00:05:10.918
System, please come out

00:05:11.325 --> 00:05:13.244
Didn’t I already know I was wrong?

00:05:13.745 --> 00:05:15.931
Why can't you give me a chance?

00:05:59.931 --> 00:06:00.721
It's all your fault

00:06:01.248 --> 00:06:03.038
It's all your fault, it's all your fault

00:06:03.063 --> 00:06:04.103
It's all your fault

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:13.447
sorry

00:06:16.663 --> 00:06:17.706
I'm late

00:06:36.214 --> 00:06:39.065
Happy birthday to you

00:06:39.471 --> 00:06:42.528
Happy birthday to you

00:06:42.732 --> 00:06:46.406
I wish you happiness and health

00:06:47.091 --> 00:06:47.997
have

00:06:49.063 --> 00:06:50.322
have

00:06:54.356 --> 00:06:55.081
Make a wish

00:06:55.301 --> 00:06:56.084
blow out candles

00:06:57.531 --> 00:06:58.525
Make a wish

00:06:59.756 --> 00:07:00.862
you close your eyes

00:07:02.167 --> 00:07:03.367
grant a wish

00:07:04.166 --> 00:07:05.234
tell yourself

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:07.739
Then

00:07:07.783 --> 00:07:08.744
blow out the candle

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:14.237
good

00:07:22.783 --> 00:07:24.087
Have you thought about your wish?

00:07:26.503 --> 00:07:27.440
Think about it

00:07:29.377 --> 00:07:30.216
Blow out the candles

00:07:40.433 --> 00:07:41.531
i today

00:07:41.793 --> 00:07:43.277
I was originally at Wangchunting

00:07:43.302 --> 00:07:45.383
I have prepared a candlelight dinner for you

00:07:46.079 --> 00:07:48.122
I also made you a birthday cake with my own hands

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:51.400
But this rain

00:07:52.059 --> 00:07:52.663
I tell you

00:07:52.663 --> 00:07:54.223
This is my first time making a birthday cake

00:07:54.223 --> 00:07:55.131
do you know

00:07:55.597 --> 00:07:57.287
my first time making cake

00:07:57.312 --> 00:07:58.540
This is my first time doing it myself... I know it all

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:02.125
you know

00:08:03.624 --> 00:08:05.525
You lit many candles in Wangchunting

00:08:06.672 --> 00:08:07.944
Fortunately, there was no water leakage

00:08:08.782 --> 00:08:09.828
Otherwise we'll get into trouble again

00:08:12.204 --> 00:08:13.483
But what you did

00:08:15.919 --> 00:08:16.879
It's all in my heart

00:08:28.081 --> 00:08:29.402
It's all in your heart

00:08:31.734 --> 00:08:32.665
that

00:08:33.688 --> 00:08:34.288
real

00:08:35.002 --> 00:08:36.453
What you just sang

00:08:36.991 --> 00:08:38.062
Happy birthday

00:08:39.098 --> 00:08:39.865
Very nice

00:08:43.304 --> 00:08:43.869
very

00:08:44.148 --> 00:08:44.740
OK

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:47.398
You actually remember

00:08:47.423 --> 00:08:49.023
That's a good idea

00:08:50.952 --> 00:08:51.759
clever

00:08:53.919 --> 00:08:54.638
very good

00:08:55.152 --> 00:08:55.872
very good

00:08:58.663 --> 00:08:59.582
this song

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:00.969
So nice

00:09:01.689 --> 00:09:03.290
Is it just spread among the people?

00:09:03.471 --> 00:09:04.512
Why haven't I heard of it?

00:09:05.397 --> 00:09:07.156
This is called happy birthday song

00:09:10.278 --> 00:09:11.812
Everyone has to sing it on their birthday

00:09:13.023 --> 00:09:14.862
Chaoyang District, Beijing

00:09:17.436 --> 00:09:18.397
my home

00:09:19.014 --> 00:09:21.294
That's a floor-to-ceiling window in my house

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:23.622
Ohira layer

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:27.544
And my fluffy sofa

00:09:28.635 --> 00:09:30.194
Although I don't understand

00:09:30.848 --> 00:09:33.383
But I can feel that you miss home

00:09:34.257 --> 00:09:36.206
If you are homesick, why do you come to the palace?

00:09:38.161 --> 00:09:39.161
poor family

00:09:39.894 --> 00:09:40.615
Nonsense

00:09:41.358 --> 00:09:42.557
I became famous at a young age

00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:44.209
I started doing commercials when I was twelve years old

00:09:44.387 --> 00:09:45.387
I've been popular

00:09:45.412 --> 00:09:46.274
Hacked

00:09:46.815 --> 00:09:47.575
but i

00:09:48.383 --> 00:09:49.962
Just never been poor

00:09:51.721 --> 00:09:52.987
Shooting ads is

00:09:54.834 --> 00:09:56.325
It's just a playbook for others to read.

00:09:57.484 --> 00:09:58.683
you don't know

00:09:58.941 --> 00:10:00.484
I'm in my hometown

00:10:01.332 --> 00:10:02.990
So popular

00:10:04.238 --> 00:10:06.647
I have played the role of a female general

00:10:07.131 --> 00:10:08.178
chef

00:10:08.657 --> 00:10:10.972
I also played a fairy

00:10:11.369 --> 00:10:12.650
So what is this about?

00:10:13.143 --> 00:10:14.447
What kind of stories are they?

00:10:14.953 --> 00:10:16.512
They are all love stories

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:19.419
Not that it is

00:10:20.002 --> 00:10:21.082
female general

00:10:21.117 --> 00:10:22.500
The cook and the fairy?

00:10:22.525 --> 00:10:23.112
yes

00:10:23.647 --> 00:10:24.344
general

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:25.934
Then fall in love with the enemy

00:10:26.358 --> 00:10:27.762
Nanako

00:10:27.787 --> 00:10:29.865
Naturally, he falls in love with the diners

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:31.928
That fairy?

00:10:33.825 --> 00:10:35.122
Fall in love with a fairy

00:10:38.383 --> 00:10:39.353
but

00:10:39.635 --> 00:10:40.915
This act goes on and on

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:42.053
It's all a routine

00:10:42.931 --> 00:10:43.492
boring

00:10:43.725 --> 00:10:44.337
boring

00:10:45.783 --> 00:10:47.023
Since this is boring

00:10:48.294 --> 00:10:49.375
Why are you acting?

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.439
You're asking for trouble

00:10:58.822 --> 00:11:00.197
because of acting

00:11:01.489 --> 00:11:02.756
It's my dream

00:11:05.006 --> 00:11:06.019
when i was little

00:11:06.976 --> 00:11:08.344
every summer

00:11:09.625 --> 00:11:11.184
everyone will get together

00:11:11.902 --> 00:11:12.823
watch a play

00:11:15.476 --> 00:11:16.675
this story

00:11:18.077 --> 00:11:19.837
It's about a pair of sworn sisters

00:11:21.301 --> 00:11:22.306
elder sister

00:11:22.468 --> 00:11:24.275
She is a real princess living among the people

00:11:25.362 --> 00:11:27.734
My sister is a wandering little gangster

00:11:28.753 --> 00:11:31.219
They are each other's best friends

00:11:32.236 --> 00:11:33.475
Support all the way

00:11:34.576 --> 00:11:35.522
rely on each other

00:11:37.613 --> 00:11:38.490
this is me

00:11:40.785 --> 00:11:41.986
unattainable

00:11:43.997 --> 00:11:45.231
I thought at that time

00:11:48.875 --> 00:11:49.769
if possible

00:11:51.054 --> 00:11:52.693
I want to hide behind the character

00:11:55.137 --> 00:11:56.700
to become all kinds of people

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.769
Experience thousands of lives

00:12:09.758 --> 00:12:10.678
What about yourself?

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:15.961
what kind of person are you

00:12:20.132 --> 00:12:20.847
I

00:12:24.074 --> 00:12:24.934
I have no idea

00:12:30.982 --> 00:12:32.175
Then when you grow up

00:12:33.666 --> 00:12:34.834
Is this drama still happening?

00:12:37.158 --> 00:12:37.837
Act

00:12:39.992 --> 00:12:40.872
Acting

00:12:41.591 --> 00:12:42.834
been acting

00:12:43.383 --> 00:12:44.053
good

00:12:46.056 --> 00:12:47.097
hope future

00:12:48.102 --> 00:12:49.622
One day I can see your play

00:12:54.543 --> 00:12:55.143
What's wrong

00:12:55.729 --> 00:12:56.256
Come

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:57.656
come over

00:13:02.921 --> 00:13:03.482
What's wrong

00:13:03.507 --> 00:13:04.150
Shhh

00:13:05.894 --> 00:13:06.749
empress

00:13:06.774 --> 00:13:08.774
Shufangzhai has been very noisy recently.

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:10.981
Make the harem a mess
