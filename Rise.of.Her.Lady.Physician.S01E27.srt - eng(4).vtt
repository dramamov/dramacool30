=Zelan Clears Her Mother's Name=

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.560
Wretch!

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.400
You're truly a heartless, venomous demon!

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.000
You harmed my offspring

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.080
and ruined my harem!

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.520
I'm a demon?

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.040
You're the reason

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.840
why I've ended up like this.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.960
It's all your fault.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:41.960
How dare you?

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.360
What did I do wrong?

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.120
You've been delaying the appointment
of the Crown Prince.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.560
You once told me...

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.520
You said my son was the one

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.960
you valued the most!

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.040
You said you'd make him
the Crown Prince!

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.360
And then?

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.400
You said the same to the others.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.760
You treat all of us as pawns,

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.160
moving us around at will
on the board of power!

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.600
Dad...

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.360
Dad!

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.520
Why would you do this to me?

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.000
I had someone I loved!

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.200
We were deeply in love!

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.360
However, for the sake of the family,

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.440
you forcibly sent me into

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.320
the cruel Imperial Palace!

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.760
You also told me to give birth to a son

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.120
so that I could make him
the Crown Prince

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.280
and bring honor to the whole family!

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.520
Therefore,

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.440
I had no choice but to eliminate anyone
in my way.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.760
(Behind the vermilion walls)

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.520
(are stairs built with bones.)

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.240
(Beneath the gilded honor)

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.520
(lies countless tears and blood.)

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.560
(Those rules praised as feminine virtue)

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.400
(have become blades
pressed to our throat.)

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.000
(Some use them to climb,)

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.440
(while others are driven to madness.)

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.680
(In the end,)

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.640
(We're all pitiable souls trapped in
the same invisible cage.)

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.560
Silence!

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.640
Silence!

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.080
How dare you distort the truth

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.920
and talk nonsense!

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.120
Starting today,

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.240
Consort Ning is stripped of her title!

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.000
Grant her poisoned wine!

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:04.800
Wait.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.320
The Second Prince didn't die.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.920
What did you say?

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:18.920
He survived.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.640
My son is alive,

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.240
right?

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.720
My son is still alive, right?

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:28.800
Drag her out!

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.320
My son is still alive!

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.120
My son is still alive!

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.240
Is that true?

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.240
My son is still alive!

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:40.800
Rong Zelan.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.000
Well done again.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.280
You didn't let me down.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.240
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.080
This is my duty as a healer.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.360
Lingxiao.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.040
Now that the matter is over,

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.320
it's time for you to leave the bureau.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.520
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.320
Oh, no.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.600
We mocked His Highness like that.

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.000
He definitely won't let us off.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.400
That's right.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.600
Who would've thought he's actually

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.000
the famous Marquis Xuanping's heir?

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.120
What should we do now?

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.440
Take a look at this.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:35.880
Your Highness!

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:37.600
Your Highness!

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.880
Previously, I was too ignorant.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.000
I shouldn't have mocked you
for using connections.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.150
I deserve punishment!

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.240
Your Highness, please forgive me!

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.880
We were so stupid.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.360
We shouldn't have said
you were hopeless.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.120
Please forgive me!

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.060
He had it coming.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.200
He wouldn't listen to us.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.600
You want me to forgive you.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.040
Well, I can forgive you.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.440
How about this?

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.040
For the whole day today,

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.680
whenever you see someone, you must say,

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.680
"I am completely

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.840
hopeless."

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.880
If you can do this,
I'll consider forgiving you.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.800
Yes, Your Highness!

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.720
Thanks, Your Highness!

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.400
I'm completely

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.520
hopeless!

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.080
I'm completely hopeless!

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.120
Well...

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.160
Why are you looking at me like this?

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:54.720
Is something wrong?

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.240
Or maybe...

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.120
Are you enchanted by me?

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:01.840
You brought me here.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.880
Anything to say?

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.640
I've completed my mission

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.160
at the Imperial Medical Bureau.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.560
From now on,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.920
I can no longer stay

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:12.160
in the palace every day.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:15.720
Be safe.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.200
Be safe?

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.480
Is that all you want to say?

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:23.280
Yes.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.200
It's getting late.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.440
The gates will be locked soon.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.440
Are you leaving today?

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:31.440
You…

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.280
Do you really want me to leave?

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.400
Hey!

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.000
Lord Song.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:47.800
I will.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.520
Do you know what I'm going to say?

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.360
You will what?

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.000
No matter what you say,

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.320
I will agree.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.720
I wonder if you have someone you like.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:01.600
If not,

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.680
let's get engaged.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.360
Okay.

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:12.720
But...

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:13.680
This is a big deal.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:14.960
Shouldn't you

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.680
inform your family first?

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.200
My mother passed away.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:19.720
I can decide

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.200
who I will marry.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:24.720
Okay.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:25.800
Then we'll do it.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:38.360
Today,

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:39.520
I'd like to share

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.400
a piece of good news with you.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.760
Your Majesty, please be clear.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:46.800
Rong Zelan,

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:47.920
with extraordinary skills,

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.520
has turned the tide many times

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:50.600
and saved many.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.000
She's not only
carried forward ulcer treatment

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.200
among the army

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.000
but also developed special prescriptions,

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.320
benefiting all the people.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:58.800
She's professional and compassionate,

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.920
truly a role model
for physicians across the realm.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.360
I've decided to appoint Rong Zelan

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.280
as the first female imperial physician

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:07.800
in Great Liang!

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:13.840
I

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:14.960
accept the decree!

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.560
Thanks, Your Majesty!

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:17.760
In addition,

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.280
the case of my mother's birthday banquet
from ten years ago

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:21.480
has been solved.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.000
Liu Fuling's diagnosis and treatment
of my mother

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:25.280
were timely and appropriate

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.520
without any mistakes.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:28.160
I've issued a decree

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:29.440
to restore her reputation

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.400
and set the record straight.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.440
Your Majesty,

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.880
I'm grateful for this!

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:47.960
Song Lingxiao.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.000
You're looking at her so fondly.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.080
Are you really that impatient?

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:58.960
I've

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.840
long heard of the romance between

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:01.800
you and Physician Rong.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.120
Today,

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.720
I'll do you a favor.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:06.720
I'll bestow the marriage

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:07.640
for you two.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.400
Wonderful.

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:13.450
Great.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.320
Great.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.040
Thanks, Your Majesty!

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.880
(Imperial Decree)
By His Majesty's decree,

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.720
Rong Zelan, Imperial Physician
of the Imperial Medical Bureau,

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.080
with great skills and benevolence,

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:27.200
has cured grave illnesses
and saved many in the palace.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.840
Song Lingxiao, Heir of Marquis Xuanping,

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.440
is a loyal and brave man.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:34.200
They're both pillars of the nation.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.000
With deep affection for each other,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.960
they truly make a perfect match.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.440
I hereby bestow the marriage.

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.440
They may choose an auspicious day
