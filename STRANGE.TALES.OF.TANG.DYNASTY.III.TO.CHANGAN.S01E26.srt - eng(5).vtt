[Strange Tales of Tang Dynasty III:
To Chang'an]

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.930
[Episode 26]

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.640
The poets' contest in a tavern

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.850
showed the spirit of Tang poets

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.150
in every stroke.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.630
Poets are scholars,
but they also value martial prowess,

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:53.070
and above all, righteousness.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.920
Wang Youbo, Gao Da, and Ruan Daxiong

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.759
all showed unwavering loyalty
to their friends.

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.430
And Leng Ji risked his life
for the one he loves.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.900
All who joined the poets' contest

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.280
are heroes.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.710
Didn't you and I take part as well?

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.710
Heroes include people like us.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:16.590
Su Wuming.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.000
Tell me,

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.240
what defines the Tang Empire?

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.900
What defines the Tang Empire?

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.840
Swords and poetry

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.360
define the Tang Empire.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.030
Then tell me,

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.310
what is Chang'an?

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.430
A place where poetry and danger coexist—

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.710
that is Chang'an.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:40.150
I believe

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.520
poetry matters

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:43.640
to the Tang Empire

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.630
and to Chang'an.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.060
But more importantly,

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.000
one must have a poetic heart.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.260
As Tang people,

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.150
no matter the hardship,

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:52.520
we must never lose

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.120
our ability to sense poetry,

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.910
just like we are now.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.710
Lingfeng, your understanding

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.190
of a poetic heart is so profound.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.030
I'm enlightened.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.360
Senior,
you used your network of investigators

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.000
to help me capture the two ringleaders.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.470
Thank you.

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:58.680
Sister-in-law,

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:59.550
am I pretty?

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.150
Yes.

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.240
Come, sit here.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:10.800
Sister-in-law,

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.840
who am I marrying today?

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.470
No rush.

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:23.870
Drink this tea first.

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.000
It's so bitter.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.750
Though bitter, it's good tea.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.730
Drink more
and you'll grow even more beautiful.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.260
Brother, you're here!

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:02.720
You...

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.800
You don't want me to get married.

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:07.560
What should I do?

[In Virtuous Company]

Honey.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.920
Why are you dressed like this again?

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.040
Honey, please don't be angry.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.240
You always have to coax Jia

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.430
to take her medicine.

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.040
If I had known it would be like this,

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.510
I might as well have let her die.

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:24.920
How can you say such things?

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.320
What do you want me to say?

Master, bad news!

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.110
Captain Feng sent word

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:33.190
that someone died in Fengle District

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.310
and asked you to go quickly.

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:35.680
You fool! Why are you shouting?

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.240
If you scare the young lady,

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.440
I'll break your legs!

The captain of Chang'an County is here.

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:30.310
The coroner needs to examine the body.

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:31.240
Please make way.

Sheriff Wei.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.500
The body has been examined.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.240
The wound is on the right side
of his neck,

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.920
and the edges are serrated.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.510
He was likely hacked to death
with a sharp weapon,

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:13.440
such as a sickle.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:14.920
What about the blood under his head?

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.800
It seems he fell on his head

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.050
after being struck.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:19.560
Nonsense.

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:21.600
The neck wound isn't deep.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.600
It may not be fatal.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:23.830
The injury at the back of his head

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:25.430
is likely the actual cause of death.

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:26.750
Sir, I'll examine it again.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:27.360

Why didn't you call

No need for that.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.930
What a coincidence.

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:40.190
Although I'm not a coroner,

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.630

in Yongzhou Prefecture Office.

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:01.310
Since you are willing to graciously

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:02.480
take on the role of coroner,

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.040
I, Wei Tao,
sheriff of Chang'an County from Jingzhao,

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.570
offer my thanks in advance.

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:09.050
No need for thanks.

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:20.520
This should be an ordinary homicide case.

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:23.030
I didn't expect you to arrive before me.

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:25.360
So how do you want
to handle the case next—

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.680
should Yongzhou Prefecture Office
investigate it directly,

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.740
or should Chang'an County handle it?

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:32.549
The Judicial Office is handling cases
on-site in the districts.

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:34.360
We just happened
to be at Fengle District today.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.440
This case was unexpected.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.600
No one reported it.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:37.270
So,

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:40.280
it would be more appropriate
for you to handle it.

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:42.360
Then I won't stand on ceremony.

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:44.640

This shop isn't small.

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.120
Is there a manager or any clerks?

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:52.480
Yes.

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:53.550
Bring them here for questioning.

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:53.960

Yes.

and reopens at 1 PM,

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.080

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.200
and gave us an hour

to eat and rest.

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:16.150
Our boss was in a good mood today.

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:17.240
He said during this one hour,

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.210

Hurry!

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:02.390
The body has been examined.

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:04.910
As you suspected,

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:07.650
the blow to the back of his head
came first

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.540
and was more fatal.

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:11.030
The wound on the neck

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.480
was likely caused by this sickle.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.070
For easier harvesting,

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:18.720
sickles have serrated edges.

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:21.750
This is clearly visible
on the victim's wound.

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:24.960
So, although the coroner is young

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.080
and inexperienced,

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.790
he's not entirely useless.

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:38.080
Then what kind of weapon

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.280
caused the wound to the back of his head?

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:41.750
I'm not sure yet.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.460
We need to shave the victim's hair

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:47.010
for further examination.

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:50.360
Then we'll take the body back
to the county office.

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.440
Chang'an County
still has skilled coroners.

Official Lu, please rest assured.

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:55.600
Of course I will.

00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:57.270
This area is a busy market.

00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:58.750
The killer must have left traces

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:00.390
when sneaking into the flower shop.

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:02.550
I plan to look for clues
by visiting the neighbors.

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:04.280
Official Lu, what do you think?

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:05.150

Here's the thing.

My boss's original surname was Wu.

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:48.630

It said peonies were popular in Luoyang.

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:02.120
He immediately converted

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:03.870
the charcoal shop into a flower shop.

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:05.200
He even changed his surname.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.000

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.150
into it.

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:10.670

For Berry to ask that,

00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:55.310
it means she knew

the amount Qingcong was collecting.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.070
Dou saying he went to meet his lover

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:03.070
was just an excuse.

And Berry showing up near the flower shop

wasn't a coincidence.

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:11.070
You knew Qingcong was weak,

00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:13.790
so you purposely sent Berry
to provoke him.

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:15.480

Usually I'm the one collecting debts.

00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:45.160

00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:47.030

some backbone deep down.

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.480
I figured if Berry provoked him,

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:52.240
maybe he'd manage

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:53.700
to get all 7 silver ingots.

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:55.290
And even if he only got 6,

00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:56.350
I could take them,

00:26:56.550 --> 00:26:57.240
and they'd be enough for me

00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:58.500
to run away with Berry.

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:00.750
I wouldn't be the one collecting the debt,

00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:01.550
so An Gang

00:27:01.550 --> 00:27:02.880
wouldn't come after me.

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:04.070
Wouldn't that be perfect?

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:05.110

00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:07.310
If An Gang doesn't come after you,

00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:08.970
I'll be the one to die, won't I?

00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:11.110
We're brothers!

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:12.590
I'll kill you!

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:13.550
Again?

00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:15.350
Let go!

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:20.510
See? These two brothers

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:22.510
really do know each other.

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:25.790
Qingcong does have a bit of backbone.

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:27.510
Dou,

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:29.750
how did you murder Hua Fu?

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:30.830
Confess!

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:32.010
I didn't...

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:34.480
kill him alone.

00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:36.960
When Qingcong went to find Berry,

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.290
I was hiding in the room.

00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:39.680
Is it just one silver ingot?

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:41.740
If I wanted more, it wouldn't be hard,

00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:43.310
but I know my limits.

00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:44.790
We'll have plenty of good days ahead.

00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:45.440
I was after

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:46.790
7 silver ingots.

00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:48.960
I thought there would be at least 6.

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:51.160
But he only came back with one.

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:52.700
Didn't that ruin the plan?

00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:54.240
So I decided

00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:56.800
to go to the flower shop myself.

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.350
I had no idea

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:04.940
Qingcong had actually killed Hua Fu!

00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:07.110
I mustered my courage
to look for the silver ingots,

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:08.770
but I didn't find a single one.

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:39.850
So you're saying

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:41.830
the wound on the back of Hua Fu's head

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:43.000
wasn't caused by you?

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.920
Of course not. It was him!

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:46.250
Qingcong!

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:47.750
What did you hit him with?

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:50.040
Couldn't you have just killed him
with one blow?

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:51.760
Now I've been dragged into this

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:53.550
-as a murderer too!
-Nonsense! I didn't hit him!

00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:55.110
Officer, it was him!

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:57.440
-He killed him!
-Officer, it wasn't me!

00:28:57.510 --> 00:28:58.480
You still won't confess?

00:28:58.480 --> 00:28:59.550
Insolent criminals!

00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:01.030
Repeatedly showing contempt
for this court!

00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:01.550
Guards!

00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:02.440
Take them out

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:03.520
and give each of them 20 strokes!

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:04.650
It really wasn't me!

00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:06.240
Officer, I didn't kill him!

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:06.920
Officer!

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.160
Officer, he did it! Officer!

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:11.000
Officer!

00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:12.630
Are you Berry?

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:14.680
Yes.

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:16.920
Are you sure Dou didn't bring back

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:18.350
any other ingots?

00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:19.880
No.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:21.920
He even said

00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:23.830
that after we fled to Luoyang,

00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:26.960
he still wanted me to work as a songstress
to support him.

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:50.360
You are so flustered.

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:51.770
Where are you going?

00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:01.750
Who are you to act so boldly?

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:09.700
What's in your bundle?

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:10.640
Open it.

00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:12.510
Why should I show you?

00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:13.960
Because of this.

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:16.000
Are you insane?

00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:16.680
Get lost!

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:20.240
How dare you....

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.720
How dare you hit me!

00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:27.350
You...

00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:34.880
Mercy, lady! Please spare me!

00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:37.770
So many silver ingots?

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.270
I'll talk! I was just greedy for money.

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:49.680
Just you wait.

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:03.240
Since the guy from An Gang
didn't take the silver ingots,

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:04.650
I hid there to see

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:05.440
where the boss

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:06.750
kept them

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:08.490
so I could steal them later.

00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:09.550
But...

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:40.620
He didn't take any ingots.

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:42.110
I was overjoyed.

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:42.840
But...

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:44.350
But before I could make a move,

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:45.590
Qingcong came back.

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:47.720
Hua Fu! I'm back!

00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:50.520
This matter must be settled today!

00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:51.590
If you dare

00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:52.880
stick your head out again,

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:54.480
I won't hesitate at all!

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:55.760
Where are you?

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:26.960
I'm telling the truth!

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:28.200
I was just greedy.

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:29.750
I didn't kill my boss!

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:30.920
I wouldn't dare!

00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:33.790
Please, Officers, have mercy!
Spare my life!

00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:35.070
Please!

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:36.580
What the manager said

00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:37.030
[No Harm Shall Come]

00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:38.590
matches Qingcong's words.

00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:40.960
It seems the person
wearing the white mask,

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:42.070
likely a Zoroastrian,

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:43.110
is the murderer.

00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:46.110
How should we proceed
with the investigation?

00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:47.400
Please advise us, Lu.

00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:49.550
The Tang Empire embraces all cultures.

00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:50.640
In Chang'an,

00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:53.240
besides Buddhist temples
and Taoist shrines,

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:55.550
there are also Persian temples,
Zoroastrian temples.

00:32:55.550 --> 00:32:58.750
These Zoroastrian temples
are also called Xian temples.

00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:00.590
There's not just one, right?

00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:02.130
If I remember correctly,

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:04.240
there are 5 Xian temples in Chang'an.

00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:06.310
One is in Jinggong District,

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:08.480
and the other 4 are in Chang'an County.

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:10.140
Mr. Su, you have a good memory.

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:12.830
There are indeed
4 Xian temples in Chang'an County,

00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:14.310
located in Liquan, Puning,

00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:15.640
Buzheng, and Chonghua.

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:17.880
I'll go investigate
these 4 districts first.

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:18.680
As for

00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:22.090
Jinggong District in Wannian County,

00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:24.030
as Chang'an County Sheriff,

00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:26.110
it's not appropriate for me to go there.

00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:27.640
I'm willing to do it for you.

00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:28.690
Thank you, then.

00:33:28.690 --> 00:33:31.250
[No Harm Shall Come]

00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:32.710
Sheriff Wei, please wait.

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:36.130
So far, the only one
who has seen the murderer up close

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:37.270
is Qingcong.

00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:40.440
My sworn sister Pei Xijun
is skilled in painting.

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:42.790
She could sketch the killer's appearance.

00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:45.790
Could she be allowed
into the Chang'an County prison?

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:47.110
Of course.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.920
Thank you very much.

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:55.790
[Jinggong District, Wannian County]

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:07.640
Official Lu,
I wasn't expecting your visit.

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:08.880
Please forgive the poor reception.

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:10.710
I am the district head
of Jinggong District.

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:12.590
Please forgive me
for not being able to accompany you.

00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:14.420
You see, as soon as it gets dark,

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:16.000
the deity procession will begin.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.320
The Seven-Saint Blades are all dressed up.

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:19.550
Go on with your business.

00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:21.190
We'll just enjoy the festivities.

00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:22.550
Then I'll take my leave.

00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:26.960
What is the Seven-Saint Blade?

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:29.440
It's a ritual with illusions

00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:30.840
to summon the gods.

00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:32.400
During the ritual,

00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:34.610
7 people each wield a sharp blade,

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:36.840
stabbing each other or themselves,

00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:40.000
showing devotion through the bloodshed.

00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:42.570
At the same time, they perform illusions,

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:45.610
blurring the line
between reality and deception

00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:47.370
to invite the gods to descend.

00:34:49.110 --> 00:34:50.590
This... this is...

00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:53.800
I know what you want to say.

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:56.520
Emperor Gaozong thought it was too bloody

00:34:56.630 --> 00:34:58.280
and banned it.

00:34:58.590 --> 00:34:59.880
But later I heard

00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:02.110
that after
the Cantian Tower Illusion Convention,

00:35:02.110 --> 00:35:03.510
there was some relaxation.

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:05.370
The current god summoning ritual

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:06.920
no longer uses

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:07.880
real weapons.

00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:10.710
They use paper or wooden ones.

00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:14.260
The so-called stabbing and self-stabbing

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:16.030
are just a performance.

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:17.760
The blood on their heads, faces,

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:18.670
and necks

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:20.630
is animal blood

00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:23.000
applied to the "wounds."

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:24.630
Just makeup.

00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:27.720
That's more like it.

00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:59.050
Here they come.

00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:00.800
Here they come.

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.480
Monthly deity procession!

00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:05.110
Today, the deity procession begins again!

00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:06.800
Fire God,

00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:09.070
descend at Jinggong today!

00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:13.810
Seven-Saint Blades! Seven-Saint Blades!

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:17.400
Seven-Saint Blades! Seven-Saint Blades!

00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:19.960
Seven-Saint Blades! Seven-Saint Blades!

00:36:20.110 --> 00:36:21.380
See, I told you,

00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:23.710
the Seven Holy Blades
are the most popular.

00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:26.360
It is said that during the ritual,

00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:28.800
the person under the flame cloth

00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:30.960
is possessed by the Fire God.

00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:32.620
There's also a saying

00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:35.110
that anyone who crawls
under the flame cloth

00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:36.670
will have good luck for a year,

00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:38.730
and everything they do will succeed.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.220
Seven-Saint Blades! Seven-Saint Blades!

00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:43.620
Seven-Saint Blades! Seven-Saint Blades!

00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:45.040
Seven-Saint Blades!

00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:46.270
Seven-Saint Blades!

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:49.190
Let's crawl under the flame cloth!

00:37:29.590 --> 00:37:31.840
Bravo!

00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:41.670
This...

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:43.960
Mr. Ma?

00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:45.930
What's wrong with you?

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:51.840
Ma Kui is dead!

00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:53.960
Mr. Ma!

00:37:58.110 --> 00:37:58.800
Step back!

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:00.590
I, Lu Lingfeng,
Yongzhou Judicial Official,

00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:01.700
am here!

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:03.080
Everyone, step back!

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:05.310
I, Du Yu, Wannian County Sheriff, am here!

00:38:05.310 --> 00:38:05.550
[Du Yu, Wannian County Sheriff]

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:06.750
Everyone, step back!

00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:13.440
Official Lu.

00:38:14.590 --> 00:38:15.250
Sheriff Du.

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:22.480
Who are you?

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:23.710
The coroner hasn't arrived yet.

00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:26.320
Why are you touching the body
without permission?

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:27.320
This is Su Wuming.

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:29.410
He works for Yongzhou Prefecture.

00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:32.030
So you're Master Di's disciple.

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:33.150
However,

00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:34.710
the coroners in Wannian County
are quite capable too.

00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:35.280
What?

00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:37.840
The case happened right under my nose.

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:39.840
Is the Yongzhou Prefecture Office
going to investigate it directly?

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:40.630
Not exactly.

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:42.960
We were just here to see the festivities

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:44.480
when the sudden murder occurred.

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:45.010
This case

00:38:45.110 --> 00:38:48.240
should indeed be investigated
by Wannian County first.

00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:50.920
Official Lu.

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:53.030
Sheriff Du is right.

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:54.510
I was being hasty.

00:38:55.570 --> 00:38:56.320
My mistake.

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:02.810
Who is leading today's deity procession?

00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:04.690
Make way! Make way!

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:06.360
-Move! Move!
-Sir, it's...

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:07.000
It's me!

00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:10.840
He Bi?

00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:12.440
[He Bi, Zoroastrian Priest
from the High Priest's Residence]

00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:14.960
According to custom,
crawling under the flame cloth

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:16.190
is believed to bring good luck.

00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:17.400
Many people did crawl under it

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:18.030
just now.

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:20.110
That makes it hard

00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:21.440
to determine who the murderer is.

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:22.770
Zoroastrian Priest He,

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:24.840
finding the murderer
is the office's responsibility.

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:26.170
What do you mean by that?

00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:27.630
I mean nothing.

00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:30.440
Since the office
is going to investigate the case,

00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:32.070
I'll continue
leading the deity procession.

00:39:32.070 --> 00:39:33.130
A murder happened,

00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:35.280
and you still want
to continue the deity procession?

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:36.590
The ritual must not be stopped.

00:39:36.590 --> 00:39:37.190
Stop.

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:41.190
Where were you when the murder happened?

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:43.340
When the murder happened?

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.070
Didn't you see that

00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:47.070
I was at the front of the procession?

00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:51.930
How often is this deity procession held?

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:54.760
The Seven-Saint Blade deity procession
happens once a month.

00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:57.920
This time, it's the Fire God
who descends in Jinggong District.

00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:00.230
Who are the members

00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:02.200
of the Seven-Saint Blades?

00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:03.840
Don't you know?

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:05.640
I'm asking you!

00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:12.920
They are merchants from the two markets

00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:14.400
and followers of Zoroastrianism.

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:15.600
They rotate monthly.

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:16.610
The deceased

00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:19.630
was the biggest pepper merchant
in the East Market.

00:40:19.630 --> 00:40:20.400
He's Mr. Ma,

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:21.510
Ma Kui.

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:24.690
Do you have any more questions?

00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:25.880
If not,

00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:28.440
I'll continue the deity procession.

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:29.770
The timing of the ritual

00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:31.320
cannot be delayed.

00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:32.150
What if

00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:35.030
I don't allow you
to continue the deity procession?

00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:37.070
Sheriff Du, why such a show of force?

00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:38.430
Don't forget,

00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:41.470
I'm not only the priest
of the Zoroastrian temple,

00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:44.360
but also the Zoroastrian Priest
of the High Priest's Residence.

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:45.490
I'm an official too.

00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:50.170
An unranked official
counts as an official?

00:40:50.590 --> 00:40:51.400
You're arrogant!

00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:52.590
You're overbearing!

00:40:52.590 --> 00:40:53.590
This is Chang'an!

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:54.480
Let alone

00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:56.110
a minor Zoroastrian Priest,

00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:57.320
even the High Priest

00:40:57.320 --> 00:40:58.190
in the High Priest's Residence

00:40:58.190 --> 00:40:59.440
must behave properly

00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:01.520
before the laws of the Tang Empire!

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:05.100
How did I not behave properly?

00:41:05.230 --> 00:41:06.320
Leading the deity procession

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:07.480
is to pray

00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:10.610
for good weather, prosperity,
and peace for the people.

00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:17.690
Not a single member

00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:18.960
of the Seven-Saint Blades
under the flame cloth

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:20.000
may leave!

00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:23.320
You heard that.

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:24.480
Then cooperate

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:26.590
with this Sheriff Du in the investigation.

00:41:26.590 --> 00:41:27.450
Everyone else,

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.530
follow me
and continue the deity procession!

00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:35.690
Captain Xu.

00:41:37.590 --> 00:41:38.480
Take these 6 people

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:39.590
and Ma Kui's body

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:40.860
back to the office.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:41.440
Yes.

00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:42.780
Come on!

00:41:44.110 --> 00:41:44.920
-Go!
-Go!

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:47.960
Hurry up! Move!
