00:02:03.025 --> 00:02:04.305
Why isn't there any response?

00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:07.505
How could this happen?

00:02:07.624 --> 00:02:08.544
Have we been exposed?

00:02:08.625 --> 00:02:09.424
It's fine.

00:02:09.544 --> 00:02:10.665
I have an idea.

00:02:11.424 --> 00:02:12.464
What is it?

00:02:12.785 --> 00:02:14.024
Do you know Tracking?

00:02:15.024 --> 00:02:16.024
I don't know

00:02:16.105 --> 00:02:16.984
Tracking.

00:02:17.065 --> 00:02:17.984
And spells are

00:02:18.024 --> 00:02:18.704
not my expertise.

00:02:18.785 --> 00:02:20.625
But I have talents.

00:02:33.785 --> 00:02:34.304
There.

00:02:48.984 --> 00:02:50.264
It's been all night.

00:02:50.385 --> 00:02:51.984
Why hasn't Lin Hu arrived yet?

00:02:52.185 --> 00:02:53.264
They told me

00:02:53.424 --> 00:02:54.984
not to act alone.

00:02:56.065 --> 00:02:57.665
Yet they didn't show up.

00:03:05.424 --> 00:03:06.665
What's going on?

00:03:07.385 --> 00:03:08.864
Where's he heading?

00:03:10.905 --> 00:03:11.544
That way.

00:03:12.464 --> 00:03:13.304
Can I trust you?

00:03:13.304 --> 00:03:14.225
Let's go.

00:03:16.024 --> 00:03:17.304
Trust me.

00:03:17.385 --> 00:03:18.464
Over there. Let's go.

00:03:18.785 --> 00:03:19.945
Why didn't I smell it?

00:03:20.065 --> 00:03:21.304
Are you a hound or a fox?

00:03:21.704 --> 00:03:23.520
Tell me. I don't hate demon cultivators.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.905
They're getting along well.

00:03:24.945 --> 00:03:25.424
You...

00:03:32.945 --> 00:03:34.625
This beggar seems suspicious.

00:03:36.424 --> 00:03:37.464
Something's off.

00:03:43.024 --> 00:03:43.704
Let's go.

00:04:03.665 --> 00:04:04.825
What should we do now?

00:04:04.825 --> 00:04:05.864
If he goes further,

00:04:05.984 --> 00:04:06.905
he'll fall off.

00:04:06.945 --> 00:04:08.744
This isn't normal human behavior.

00:04:08.905 --> 00:04:09.945
Might be a puppet.

00:04:10.105 --> 00:04:11.144
A puppet?

00:04:17.704 --> 00:04:18.945
Who are these people?

00:04:19.024 --> 00:04:20.065
Puppets.

00:04:20.104 --> 00:04:21.224
Puppets?

00:04:22.985 --> 00:04:24.625
They are surrounding to attack him.

00:04:25.024 --> 00:04:26.305
Let's rescue him

00:04:26.305 --> 00:04:27.024
first.

00:04:32.305 --> 00:04:33.825
Lady Ling Bo.

00:04:35.344 --> 00:04:36.065
I knew

00:04:36.185 --> 00:04:37.664
only you could

00:04:37.985 --> 00:04:38.904
subdue them swiftly,

00:04:38.985 --> 00:04:40.305
Lady Ling Bo.

00:04:47.065 --> 00:04:47.945
I didn't do it.

00:04:48.065 --> 00:04:48.745
Not you?

00:04:50.024 --> 00:04:50.625
I see.

00:04:50.664 --> 00:04:52.065
Something's off down the cliff.

00:04:52.264 --> 00:04:53.305
I'll go investigate.

00:04:53.425 --> 00:04:54.464
By the way, Lady Ling Bo.

00:04:54.584 --> 00:04:55.664
- Young Master.
- Are you here

00:04:55.664 --> 00:04:56.784
for Chang De?

00:04:56.945 --> 00:04:57.945
No.

00:04:58.664 --> 00:04:59.625
No?

00:04:59.704 --> 00:05:00.545
Didn't you say

00:05:00.545 --> 00:05:01.825
to go to Fengyi to find him?

00:05:01.865 --> 00:05:02.825
None of your business.

00:05:02.825 --> 00:05:03.344
I...

00:05:04.784 --> 00:05:05.584
I get it now.

00:05:05.784 --> 00:05:06.664
You must be tracking

00:05:06.664 --> 00:05:07.584
his trail

00:05:07.584 --> 00:05:08.625
to steal his glory, right?

00:05:08.625 --> 00:05:09.104
You!

00:05:09.985 --> 00:05:10.945
Doesn't matter.

00:05:11.065 --> 00:05:11.784
Anyway,

00:05:11.784 --> 00:05:12.904
I've tracked the target.

00:05:12.904 --> 00:05:14.264
These are just decoys.

00:05:14.385 --> 00:05:15.264
The real catch

00:05:15.305 --> 00:05:15.985
is over there.

00:05:16.264 --> 00:05:17.425
What's wrong with

00:05:17.584 --> 00:05:18.584
those puppets?

00:05:18.664 --> 00:05:19.664
There's a hut nearby.

00:05:19.664 --> 00:05:20.904
You'll know there.

00:05:21.024 --> 00:05:22.024
Aren't you coming?

00:05:22.264 --> 00:05:22.945
No.

00:05:23.024 --> 00:05:24.344
Passing up such a chance

00:05:24.344 --> 00:05:25.104
to get the glory?

00:05:25.224 --> 00:05:26.745
I have more important things to do.

00:05:27.264 --> 00:05:27.985
Farewell.

00:05:30.865 --> 00:05:31.784
Tan Feng.

00:05:31.865 --> 00:05:32.464
Do you smell

00:05:32.464 --> 00:05:34.185
a strange stench here?

00:05:34.185 --> 00:05:34.825
Let's go.

00:05:34.985 --> 00:05:35.904
After all these days,

00:05:36.024 --> 00:05:37.065
I've gotten used to it.

00:05:51.904 --> 00:05:52.904
Finally.

00:05:53.385 --> 00:05:54.065
I can't stand

00:05:54.065 --> 00:05:55.344
the stench anymore.

00:05:57.704 --> 00:05:58.344
Come on.

00:06:18.185 --> 00:06:19.704
Here. Over here.

00:06:22.825 --> 00:06:23.825
Oh my.

00:06:23.985 --> 00:06:25.664
This is horrifying.

00:06:25.784 --> 00:06:27.144
All these were made from

00:06:27.144 --> 00:06:28.104
living people?

00:06:28.704 --> 00:06:30.464
This is the cruelty of creating puppets.

00:06:32.584 --> 00:06:33.745
This complicates things.

00:06:33.865 --> 00:06:35.024
Not a living creature here.

00:06:35.144 --> 00:06:36.264
We can't interrogate anyone.

00:06:36.425 --> 00:06:37.464
Stay calm.

00:06:37.985 --> 00:06:39.464
We might find clues here.

00:06:48.664 --> 00:06:50.104
I thought I just saw

00:06:50.185 --> 00:06:52.104
this one blink.

00:06:53.305 --> 00:06:54.505
You must be mistaken.

00:06:56.024 --> 00:06:57.224
Just figure it out.

00:07:18.704 --> 00:07:19.625
- He moved.
- Stop!

00:07:20.185 --> 00:07:21.904
Guys,

00:07:22.024 --> 00:07:24.264
why are you detaining me?

00:07:24.385 --> 00:07:26.505
I know nothing.

00:07:26.505 --> 00:07:28.505
I truly know nothing.

00:07:28.625 --> 00:07:29.945
You control the puppets, right?

00:07:29.985 --> 00:07:32.344
Why did the puppets
climb up from the cliff?

00:07:33.144 --> 00:07:34.344
I know nothing.

00:07:34.344 --> 00:07:35.985
I've told you I don't know.

00:07:36.224 --> 00:07:37.024
If you don't tell,

00:07:37.024 --> 00:07:38.144
I'll make you die here.

00:07:39.024 --> 00:07:40.144
Even if you kill me,

00:07:40.144 --> 00:07:41.704
I still don't know a thing.

00:07:41.704 --> 00:07:43.425
I know nothing.

00:07:44.024 --> 00:07:45.264
Think I won't kill you?

00:07:45.264 --> 00:07:45.945
Right?

00:07:46.264 --> 00:07:46.945
Tan Feng,

00:07:47.144 --> 00:07:48.625
don't actually kill him.

00:07:49.065 --> 00:07:50.425
Let me handle this.

00:07:54.865 --> 00:07:56.224
You're allergic to feathers?

00:07:56.305 --> 00:07:57.104
Talk.

00:07:57.704 --> 00:07:58.904
Or else...

00:07:59.065 --> 00:08:00.904
Don't use the feather.

00:08:01.104 --> 00:08:02.825
I'll talk.

00:08:07.144 --> 00:08:08.945
Down that cliff

00:08:09.024 --> 00:08:10.385
lies a village.

00:08:10.505 --> 00:08:11.664
Many years ago,

00:08:11.664 --> 00:08:13.144
the master of Fengyi Realm,

00:08:13.144 --> 00:08:14.264
Immortal Bo Yuan,

00:08:14.385 --> 00:08:15.664
hid the realm's key

00:08:15.664 --> 00:08:17.024
in the village.

00:08:17.144 --> 00:08:19.745
Immortal Bo Yuan, master of the realm?

00:08:19.745 --> 00:08:20.745
Exactly.

00:08:20.904 --> 00:08:22.945
So you sent puppets down

00:08:23.065 --> 00:08:24.625
to retrieve the realm key?

00:08:26.185 --> 00:08:27.224
It's not

00:08:27.224 --> 00:08:28.464
a simple task.

00:08:28.545 --> 00:08:29.104
I've been

00:08:29.104 --> 00:08:30.185
in this desolated place

00:08:30.185 --> 00:08:31.305
scheming for so long,

00:08:31.305 --> 00:08:32.224
yet still can't get it.

00:08:32.504 --> 00:08:33.945
Why do you want the key?

00:08:34.025 --> 00:08:34.984
I'm just...

00:08:38.864 --> 00:08:40.185
Who sent you?

00:08:40.624 --> 00:08:41.785
I can't tell you.

00:08:43.344 --> 00:08:44.864
No.

00:08:44.984 --> 00:08:46.864
Spare me, please.

00:08:47.665 --> 00:08:48.344
Spare me.

00:08:48.945 --> 00:08:50.104
Lord Jiusu

00:08:50.945 --> 00:08:52.425
sent me.

00:08:52.945 --> 00:08:54.624
Listen carefully.

00:08:54.785 --> 00:08:55.825
The village

00:08:55.825 --> 00:08:57.384
lies down this cliff.

00:08:57.504 --> 00:08:59.104
After finding a path,

00:08:59.224 --> 00:09:00.825
sneak in secretly.

00:09:00.825 --> 00:09:02.785
Even it means to search every inch,

00:09:02.864 --> 00:09:04.145
you must find me

00:09:04.145 --> 00:09:05.265
the realm key.

00:09:05.905 --> 00:09:06.864
Understood?

00:09:06.984 --> 00:09:07.744
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:09:07.825 --> 00:09:08.584
Go.

00:09:17.665 --> 00:09:18.665
(He ordered me)

00:09:18.665 --> 00:09:20.464
(to obtain the realm key,)

00:09:20.624 --> 00:09:21.825
(so I brought men)

00:09:21.825 --> 00:09:22.945
(here)

00:09:23.104 --> 00:09:24.945
(and asked them to descend the cliff.)

00:09:25.265 --> 00:09:26.785
(But after waiting for a long time,)

00:09:26.785 --> 00:09:28.185
(none returned.)

00:09:28.305 --> 00:09:29.025
(Later,)

00:09:29.025 --> 00:09:29.785
(I sent)

00:09:29.785 --> 00:09:31.464
(more teams down,)

00:09:32.945 --> 00:09:35.344
(yet still, none returned.)

00:09:36.224 --> 00:09:37.305
(Soon,)

00:09:37.305 --> 00:09:38.665
(all the dark cultivators I sent)

00:09:38.665 --> 00:09:39.504
(perished.)

00:09:39.545 --> 00:09:40.665
(Without obtaining the key,)

00:09:40.704 --> 00:09:42.344
(I couldn't go back to the Lord.)

00:09:42.545 --> 00:09:44.864
(Fortunately, I can craft puppets.)

00:09:44.945 --> 00:09:46.665
(So I captured homeless beggars)

00:09:46.665 --> 00:09:48.025
(from the city)

00:09:48.145 --> 00:09:49.185
(and transformed them)

00:09:49.185 --> 00:09:50.384
(into puppets)

00:09:50.504 --> 00:09:51.425
(to continue)

00:09:51.425 --> 00:09:52.545
(the mission.)

00:09:52.665 --> 00:09:53.744
(Yet after these puppets)

00:09:53.744 --> 00:09:54.704
(entered the village,)

00:09:54.704 --> 00:09:56.305
(like the others before,)

00:09:56.464 --> 00:09:57.945
(none returned)

00:09:58.104 --> 00:10:00.025
(and I lost their track.)

00:10:01.945 --> 00:10:02.864
That's brutal.

00:10:02.905 --> 00:10:04.065
You're just sending them

00:10:04.065 --> 00:10:04.984
to their deaths.

00:10:05.104 --> 00:10:06.984
Those are practically living dead.

00:10:07.145 --> 00:10:08.425
At first,

00:10:08.464 --> 00:10:09.305
I thought

00:10:09.344 --> 00:10:11.504
my control methods might be wrong.

00:10:11.624 --> 00:10:12.425
So,

00:10:12.464 --> 00:10:13.864
I kept

00:10:13.864 --> 00:10:15.305
making adjustments.

00:10:15.464 --> 00:10:16.065
Well,

00:10:16.185 --> 00:10:17.624
I sent another one down today.

00:10:17.984 --> 00:10:19.984
Tell me about today's situation.

00:10:20.145 --> 00:10:21.704
How did he perform?

00:10:21.945 --> 00:10:23.145
How dare you ask!

00:10:23.224 --> 00:10:24.224
He almost got killed by

00:10:24.224 --> 00:10:25.185
puppets that climbed up.

00:10:26.065 --> 00:10:28.104
The puppets we encountered earlier

00:10:28.145 --> 00:10:29.545
were also the ones you sent down?

00:10:29.704 --> 00:10:31.344
I didn't expect it.

00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:32.665
I wonder what it is

00:10:32.665 --> 00:10:33.864
down there

00:10:34.025 --> 00:10:36.025
that can counter my puppets.

00:10:36.185 --> 00:10:36.825
No way.

00:10:36.984 --> 00:10:38.384
I need to properly

00:10:38.464 --> 00:10:40.025
craft a new batch of puppets

00:10:40.104 --> 00:10:41.464
and fight against it.

00:10:41.584 --> 00:10:42.384
What are you doing?

00:10:42.545 --> 00:10:44.145
You're so wicked.

00:10:44.145 --> 00:10:44.945
Wicked.

00:10:46.384 --> 00:10:47.744
It seems the village

00:10:47.785 --> 00:10:48.545
must've had

00:10:48.545 --> 00:10:50.185
some mechanism to protect the realm key.

00:10:50.785 --> 00:10:52.584
It can counter the puppets.

00:10:53.265 --> 00:10:54.545
Impressive.

00:10:55.504 --> 00:10:56.785
But this is just a speculation.

00:10:57.545 --> 00:10:58.305
Old man,

00:10:59.384 --> 00:11:00.584
tell us something useful.

00:11:00.665 --> 00:11:01.504
Everything I said

00:11:01.504 --> 00:11:02.704
was useful.

00:11:03.185 --> 00:11:04.185
Then earlier,

00:11:04.224 --> 00:11:06.384
the puppet that tried
to steal the Azure Phoenix

00:11:06.504 --> 00:11:07.624
was also your creation?

00:11:08.545 --> 00:11:09.425
Of course.

00:11:09.425 --> 00:11:10.584
I'm not boasting,

00:11:10.744 --> 00:11:12.185
but there are only

00:11:12.185 --> 00:11:12.825
few people

00:11:12.825 --> 00:11:13.864
who can craft puppets

00:11:13.905 --> 00:11:15.224
that exquisitely as I do.

00:11:15.384 --> 00:11:16.185
But the way

00:11:16.185 --> 00:11:17.185
to control puppets

00:11:17.224 --> 00:11:18.584
is extremely challenging.

00:11:18.785 --> 00:11:19.905
If you apply too much force,

00:11:19.905 --> 00:11:21.224
they become brainless brutes.

00:11:21.344 --> 00:11:23.224
Too little force,

00:11:23.825 --> 00:11:25.025
and they go rogue,

00:11:25.025 --> 00:11:26.624
even betray me.

00:11:26.744 --> 00:11:27.744
That's why

00:11:27.785 --> 00:11:29.504
I can only crush them.

00:11:29.624 --> 00:11:30.504
Tell me,

00:11:30.624 --> 00:11:31.584
is my skill

00:11:31.584 --> 00:11:33.065
remarkable?

00:11:33.464 --> 00:11:34.344
Right?

00:11:34.384 --> 00:11:35.545
Your skill is decent,

00:11:35.545 --> 00:11:36.504
but you are not.

00:11:36.584 --> 00:11:38.065
How dare you take innocent lives.

00:11:38.185 --> 00:11:40.545
You've beaten me three times.

00:11:40.665 --> 00:11:41.785
Everyone,

00:11:41.905 --> 00:11:43.104
please

00:11:43.104 --> 00:11:44.185
spare me.

00:11:44.224 --> 00:11:47.025
I've told you everything I know.

00:11:47.185 --> 00:11:48.104
Think about

00:11:48.265 --> 00:11:49.504
those people you sent

00:11:49.504 --> 00:11:50.224
to their deaths.

00:11:50.384 --> 00:11:51.025
Enough.

00:11:51.825 --> 00:11:52.704
Lin Hu,

00:11:53.104 --> 00:11:54.265
take him with us.

00:11:54.624 --> 00:11:55.224
Understood.

00:11:55.744 --> 00:11:56.905
He's of some help to us.

00:12:00.384 --> 00:12:01.864
My head hurts.

00:12:02.185 --> 00:12:03.704
My legs ache.

00:12:03.825 --> 00:12:04.504
Enough.

00:12:04.504 --> 00:12:05.425
I gave up

00:12:05.425 --> 00:12:06.464
this old trick years ago.

00:12:07.945 --> 00:12:09.624
Wait, wait.

00:12:10.864 --> 00:12:12.984
Please,

00:12:13.104 --> 00:12:14.624
I'm begging you.

00:12:14.744 --> 00:12:16.065
Have mercy, please.

00:12:16.065 --> 00:12:17.785
I really can't walk anymore.

00:12:17.864 --> 00:12:18.785
Stop dragging our feet.

00:12:19.185 --> 00:12:19.704
Move.

00:12:19.704 --> 00:12:21.025
I am completely

00:12:21.025 --> 00:12:21.905
exhausted.

00:12:21.984 --> 00:12:23.384
Especially my buttocks,

00:12:23.384 --> 00:12:24.665
they're in pain.

00:12:24.825 --> 00:12:26.744
I can't walk anymore.

00:12:26.825 --> 00:12:27.864
Putting on an act now?

00:12:28.545 --> 00:12:30.504
Where's that arrogance from earlier?

00:12:32.305 --> 00:12:33.104
Alright.

00:12:33.145 --> 00:12:33.984
Maybe

00:12:34.025 --> 00:12:35.584
we'll rest here for a while.

00:13:03.945 --> 00:13:05.624
Tan Feng, want some?

00:13:06.185 --> 00:13:07.624
It's really delicious.

00:13:07.665 --> 00:13:09.425
I roasted this especially for you.

00:13:11.065 --> 00:13:13.425
Don't you give this to

00:13:13.584 --> 00:13:15.265
your best friend first?

00:13:15.265 --> 00:13:16.665
Don't try to please me.

00:13:20.344 --> 00:13:21.224
Tan Feng.

00:13:21.344 --> 00:13:22.704
If you don't eat,

00:13:22.785 --> 00:13:23.864
then I won't, either.

00:13:24.065 --> 00:13:25.265
I'll starve

00:13:25.384 --> 00:13:26.464
with you.

00:13:27.825 --> 00:13:28.665
Fine.

00:13:28.785 --> 00:13:30.065
We've endured punishments

00:13:30.185 --> 00:13:31.584
together since childhood.

00:13:31.744 --> 00:13:33.025
We share the hardships.

00:13:35.624 --> 00:13:36.665
Silly girl.

00:13:37.825 --> 00:13:40.344
Your senior brother
has profound cultivation.

00:13:40.504 --> 00:13:42.025
Not eating for half a day

00:13:42.185 --> 00:13:43.624
or even half a year

00:13:43.785 --> 00:13:44.984
wouldn't starve him.

00:13:45.704 --> 00:13:47.785
But you're different.

00:13:47.905 --> 00:13:49.584
Your cultivation is still shallow.

00:13:49.704 --> 00:13:50.825
You eat three meals daily.

00:13:50.864 --> 00:13:51.785
If you stop suddenly,

00:13:51.785 --> 00:13:53.224
your body can't stand it.

00:13:53.344 --> 00:13:54.504
Don't overestimate yourself.

00:13:54.704 --> 00:13:56.344
If he doesn't eat, you should eat it.

00:13:58.025 --> 00:13:59.624
What did you say?

00:13:59.785 --> 00:14:01.384
Only I can instruct Kong Hou.

00:14:01.384 --> 00:14:02.545
Why do you interrupt?

00:14:07.065 --> 00:14:07.945
You!

00:14:11.224 --> 00:14:12.185
Come with me for a chat.

00:14:15.624 --> 00:14:16.584
Tan Feng.

00:14:17.984 --> 00:14:18.864
Huan Zong.

00:14:21.825 --> 00:14:24.185
You and Kong Hou are friends?

00:14:24.305 --> 00:14:24.905
Yes.

00:14:25.344 --> 00:14:26.224
Then

00:14:26.265 --> 00:14:27.704
act like proper friends.

00:14:28.025 --> 00:14:29.584
Do you know how friends should act?

00:14:36.025 --> 00:14:38.305
Friends maintain proper boundaries.

00:14:38.425 --> 00:14:39.265
No matter what,

00:14:39.425 --> 00:14:40.545
Kong Hou is a young lady,

00:14:40.545 --> 00:14:41.665
and you're a man.

00:14:41.984 --> 00:14:43.305
Respect the boundaries.

00:14:43.305 --> 00:14:44.584
Don't give people wrong ideas.

00:14:44.905 --> 00:14:45.785
Tell me,

00:14:46.384 --> 00:14:47.425
can you do that?

00:14:48.384 --> 00:14:49.104
No.

00:14:49.344 --> 00:14:49.905
You!

00:14:51.265 --> 00:14:52.825
You have ulterior motives.

00:14:54.464 --> 00:14:55.704
You exaggerate.

00:14:55.825 --> 00:14:56.945
Kong Hou

00:14:57.785 --> 00:14:58.905
is straightforward,

00:14:59.065 --> 00:15:00.065
kind-hearted,

00:15:00.265 --> 00:15:01.344
and always helpful.

00:15:01.545 --> 00:15:02.905
Naturally worth befriending.

00:15:03.104 --> 00:15:04.065
If someone develops

00:15:04.065 --> 00:15:05.305
affections for her,

00:15:05.305 --> 00:15:06.025
I'd say

00:15:06.185 --> 00:15:07.344
that's understandable.

00:15:07.704 --> 00:15:09.185
Unless you think

00:15:09.624 --> 00:15:10.864
she's unworthy?

00:15:21.864 --> 00:15:22.905
Young lady.

00:15:23.145 --> 00:15:24.065
Young lady.

00:15:24.704 --> 00:15:26.344
Stop tossing leaves around.

00:15:26.665 --> 00:15:28.265
Look at me now.

00:15:31.224 --> 00:15:31.945
They've gone

00:15:31.945 --> 00:15:33.025
to chat for quite a while.

00:15:33.265 --> 00:15:34.545
I wonder what they're chatting.

00:15:34.744 --> 00:15:35.825
Exactly.

00:15:35.945 --> 00:15:37.025
What could Tan Feng

00:15:37.025 --> 00:15:38.825
and Huan Zong be talking about?

00:15:38.825 --> 00:15:40.025
Who knows?

00:15:40.224 --> 00:15:41.224
Anyway,

00:15:41.344 --> 00:15:43.825
judging from Tan Feng's demeanor,

00:15:44.224 --> 00:15:45.224
he wants a fight.

00:15:45.344 --> 00:15:46.265
Fight?

00:15:46.344 --> 00:15:47.384
Go check it out.

00:15:48.384 --> 00:15:49.425
You watch him,

00:15:49.464 --> 00:15:51.104
and I'll go mediate.

00:15:54.945 --> 00:15:55.945
Kong Hou

00:15:55.945 --> 00:15:57.984
h-has many flaws.

00:15:58.185 --> 00:15:59.104
Don't be fooled

00:15:59.104 --> 00:16:00.104
by her pretty appearance.

00:16:00.104 --> 00:16:01.248
Her room is in a mess.

00:16:01.248 --> 00:16:02.945
She burps while eating
and picks at food.

00:16:02.945 --> 00:16:03.864
Hates washing her hair.

00:16:03.864 --> 00:16:04.464
Her hair

00:16:04.464 --> 00:16:05.425
is so greasy.

00:16:05.665 --> 00:16:06.384
Really?

00:16:07.384 --> 00:16:08.665
What's so funny?

00:16:09.825 --> 00:16:10.945
Everything you mentioned

00:16:10.945 --> 00:16:11.905
sounds adorable.

00:16:16.025 --> 00:16:17.025
Do you really

00:16:17.025 --> 00:16:18.025
fall for Kong Hou?

00:16:18.104 --> 00:16:18.744
Exactly.

00:16:19.104 --> 00:16:19.864
Have you lost

00:16:19.864 --> 00:16:20.984
your mind?

00:16:21.065 --> 00:16:21.785
Let me tell you.

00:16:21.785 --> 00:16:23.104
You don't understand her at all.

00:16:23.864 --> 00:16:25.624
She's stupid
and has poor spiritual energy.

00:16:25.704 --> 00:16:26.704
Got no improvement.

00:16:26.785 --> 00:16:27.945
And she's not aware of it,

00:16:27.984 --> 00:16:28.984
always being impulsive.

00:16:29.065 --> 00:16:30.945
Likes to wander around to have fun.

00:16:31.344 --> 00:16:33.384
She's just too playful.

00:16:33.624 --> 00:16:34.984
Once she returns and focuses

00:16:34.984 --> 00:16:35.825
on cultivation,

00:16:35.905 --> 00:16:37.065
she'll forget

00:16:37.065 --> 00:16:38.344
all the others.

00:16:38.864 --> 00:16:40.344
Tan Feng.

00:16:40.425 --> 00:16:41.744
Kong Hou, I said...

00:16:45.145 --> 00:16:46.624
Kong Hou, why are you here?

00:16:46.785 --> 00:16:47.825
I never expected

00:16:47.825 --> 00:16:48.624
you to talk ill

00:16:48.624 --> 00:16:50.104
behind me here.

00:16:50.185 --> 00:16:51.945
Kong Hou, I-I...

00:16:51.945 --> 00:16:53.265
Even if I have flaws,

00:16:53.384 --> 00:16:54.704
you could tell me directly,

00:16:54.744 --> 00:16:55.825
and I'll correct them.

00:16:55.864 --> 00:16:56.945
How could you do this?

00:16:57.145 --> 00:16:58.185
Kong Hou, I...

00:16:58.265 --> 00:16:58.945
Kong Hou.

00:16:59.344 --> 00:17:00.025
Don't

00:17:00.065 --> 00:17:01.344
blame your senior brother.

00:17:01.584 --> 00:17:02.945
In fact, I quite envy him.

00:17:03.464 --> 00:17:04.864
Having spent so much time with you,

00:17:05.104 --> 00:17:06.225
he notices every detail

00:17:06.384 --> 00:17:07.624
and remembers

00:17:07.624 --> 00:17:09.344
every awkward yet adorable moment

00:17:09.465 --> 00:17:10.384
of you.

00:17:10.705 --> 00:17:12.065
Tan Feng, what did you tell

00:17:12.065 --> 00:17:13.144
Huan Zong?

00:17:13.265 --> 00:17:14.025
Kong Hou, I...

00:17:14.025 --> 00:17:15.344
You may think this way.

00:17:15.505 --> 00:17:16.144
He can remember

00:17:16.144 --> 00:17:17.265
all your awkward moments

00:17:17.265 --> 00:17:18.465
so clearly.

00:17:18.624 --> 00:17:20.465
It proves how much he cares about you

00:17:20.705 --> 00:17:22.225
and the depth of

00:17:22.424 --> 00:17:23.705
your bond.

00:17:24.785 --> 00:17:26.065
Kong Hou, I...

00:17:33.384 --> 00:17:34.624
What are those?

00:17:42.745 --> 00:17:44.384
Huan Zong, what are those?

00:17:44.384 --> 00:17:45.465
Why are they following us?

00:17:45.624 --> 00:17:46.424
Bone-devourers.

00:17:46.465 --> 00:17:47.265
Bone-devourers?

00:17:47.305 --> 00:17:48.065
Impossible.

00:17:48.065 --> 00:17:50.336
They're the fiercest raptors
in the cultivation world.

00:17:50.336 --> 00:17:51.624
They devour humans whole.

00:17:51.664 --> 00:17:52.344
Someone must have

00:17:52.344 --> 00:17:53.184
released them.

00:17:53.305 --> 00:17:55.545
Could it be that Wu Xi?

00:18:33.545 --> 00:18:34.065
Move!

00:19:25.144 --> 00:19:25.856
Third brother.

00:19:27.465 --> 00:19:27.825
Go!

00:19:27.825 --> 00:19:28.664
You finally came.

00:19:30.825 --> 00:19:31.584
He ran away.

00:19:31.664 --> 00:19:32.864
Protect Kong Hou.

00:20:04.505 --> 00:20:05.545
Do me a favor.

00:20:05.705 --> 00:20:06.584
At least

00:20:06.584 --> 00:20:08.104
work once.

00:20:40.904 --> 00:20:41.664
Are you okay?

00:20:41.985 --> 00:20:42.985
I'm fine.

00:20:45.025 --> 00:20:45.985
Smart move.

00:20:46.184 --> 00:20:47.465
At least you helped.

00:20:47.505 --> 00:20:49.440
Even the phoenix-headed konghou
couldn't stand it

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.505
and came out to fight.

00:20:50.705 --> 00:20:51.745
Alright.

00:20:51.904 --> 00:20:52.985
Go find Tan Feng.

00:20:59.505 --> 00:21:00.384
Tan Feng.

00:21:04.825 --> 00:21:05.545
Kong Hou.

00:21:06.144 --> 00:21:07.664
Kong Hou. Save Kong Hou.

00:21:07.705 --> 00:21:08.384
Kong Hou.

00:21:13.545 --> 00:21:14.184
Kong Hou.

00:21:14.424 --> 00:21:15.184
Kong Hou.

00:21:29.545 --> 00:21:30.384
Huan Zong.

00:21:31.505 --> 00:21:32.904
Huan Zong.

00:21:34.985 --> 00:21:37.465
Huan Zong.

00:21:40.184 --> 00:21:40.944
Huan Zong.

00:21:41.184 --> 00:21:41.944
- Huan Zong.
- Kong Hou.

00:21:42.104 --> 00:21:42.825
Huan Zong.

00:21:43.065 --> 00:21:44.184
- Huan Zong.
- Kong Hou.

00:21:45.424 --> 00:21:46.144
Huan Zong.

00:21:46.144 --> 00:21:46.584
Kong Hou.

00:21:46.584 --> 00:21:47.144
Young Master.

00:21:47.545 --> 00:21:48.904
Tan Feng, let me go!

00:21:48.904 --> 00:21:49.864
Calm down, Kong Hou.

00:21:49.864 --> 00:21:51.065
Huan Zong is down there.

00:21:51.065 --> 00:21:52.584
I need to save him.

00:21:52.944 --> 00:21:54.144
- Kong Hou.
- Huan Zong.

00:21:54.344 --> 00:21:55.584
- Huan Zong.
- Kong Hou.

00:21:58.944 --> 00:22:00.344
When Huan Zong grabbed me,

00:22:00.384 --> 00:22:01.985
I saw a mass of mist,

00:22:02.144 --> 00:22:03.745
and then he got pulled downward.

00:22:03.904 --> 00:22:04.745
Impossible.

00:22:04.944 --> 00:22:06.424
There must be something or someone

00:22:06.505 --> 00:22:07.424
in the mass of mist.

00:22:07.584 --> 00:22:08.904
I didn't see anyone,

00:22:09.104 --> 00:22:10.864
but only a mass of mist.

00:22:11.065 --> 00:22:11.785
Didn't you see it?

00:22:11.785 --> 00:22:12.424
Enough.

00:22:12.424 --> 00:22:13.624
Kong Hou told you everything.

00:22:13.745 --> 00:22:14.944
Done with asking.

00:22:14.985 --> 00:22:16.065
You two

00:22:16.144 --> 00:22:17.265
must know

00:22:17.265 --> 00:22:18.184
what happened.

00:22:18.265 --> 00:22:19.225
Say it!

00:22:19.424 --> 00:22:20.505
Second brother, this...

00:22:20.505 --> 00:22:21.225
Shut up!

00:22:22.584 --> 00:22:23.624
Talk or I'll kill you!

00:22:23.624 --> 00:22:24.664
No, no.

00:22:24.664 --> 00:22:25.624
Be careful.

00:22:25.705 --> 00:22:27.225
My second brother

00:22:27.225 --> 00:22:28.545
truly knows nothing.

00:22:28.705 --> 00:22:29.465
I

00:22:29.465 --> 00:22:31.624
might know a bit more.

00:22:31.864 --> 00:22:33.184
Actually, when we

00:22:33.184 --> 00:22:34.624
let dark cultivators go down there,

00:22:34.745 --> 00:22:36.664
not all of them failed to return.

00:22:37.265 --> 00:22:38.225
There's one...

00:22:44.384 --> 00:22:44.944
Stay back.

00:22:45.025 --> 00:22:46.065
Stay back.

00:22:49.065 --> 00:22:50.545
This is my

00:22:51.465 --> 00:22:52.424
puppet?

00:22:58.745 --> 00:22:59.545
Wake up.

00:23:02.184 --> 00:23:03.785
Let me go.

00:23:03.944 --> 00:23:05.584
What happened to you?

00:23:10.545 --> 00:23:11.664
Yesterday,

00:23:11.825 --> 00:23:13.184
after descending the cliff,

00:23:13.864 --> 00:23:15.305
I saw

00:23:15.545 --> 00:23:16.985
a mass of mist.

00:23:17.424 --> 00:23:18.225
Then

00:23:18.465 --> 00:23:20.065
I got sucked into it.

00:23:20.225 --> 00:23:21.065
Sucked right in.

00:23:21.144 --> 00:23:22.184
After I woke up...

00:23:22.785 --> 00:23:24.305
I woke up...

00:23:24.465 --> 00:23:25.424
What happened?

00:23:25.825 --> 00:23:26.944
Say it.

00:23:28.184 --> 00:23:29.465
I woke up...

00:23:31.184 --> 00:23:31.785
I...

00:23:31.825 --> 00:23:33.664
I saw events from long ago.

00:23:34.904 --> 00:23:37.104
I saw my wife.

00:23:40.065 --> 00:23:42.584
I killed her.

00:23:42.825 --> 00:23:43.864
(He couldn't explain)

00:23:43.864 --> 00:23:45.104
(how he escaped properly.)

00:23:45.265 --> 00:23:46.624
(From his description,)

00:23:46.864 --> 00:23:47.985
(I think he was trapped in)

00:23:48.104 --> 00:23:49.184
(his most painful memories)

00:23:49.184 --> 00:23:50.664
(and imprisoned)

00:23:50.825 --> 00:23:52.664
(by his inner demons.)

00:23:53.384 --> 00:23:54.424
Then Huan Zong

00:23:54.424 --> 00:23:55.904
would get trapped as well.

00:23:56.144 --> 00:23:57.825
I am not sure.

00:23:57.864 --> 00:23:58.705
Then,

00:23:58.705 --> 00:24:00.505
we scoured through ancient texts,

00:24:00.545 --> 00:24:02.624
and finally uncovered the secret.

00:24:02.745 --> 00:24:04.424
Whether a cultivator or mortal,

00:24:04.505 --> 00:24:05.424
anyone who enters

00:24:05.424 --> 00:24:06.545
would get trapped,

00:24:06.624 --> 00:24:07.265
and then

00:24:07.265 --> 00:24:08.985
live within the illusion

00:24:08.985 --> 00:24:10.465
created by their inner demons

00:24:10.545 --> 00:24:12.025
and never escape.

00:24:12.144 --> 00:24:12.785
No way.

00:24:13.225 --> 00:24:15.225
(Even if the body returns,)

00:24:15.384 --> 00:24:16.785
(without conquering inner demons,)

00:24:16.944 --> 00:24:18.904
(one would remain mindless)

00:24:19.025 --> 00:24:20.424
(or die.)

00:24:22.208 --> 00:24:23.872
(Zhaoqian Hall)

00:24:55.825 --> 00:24:56.864
Your Highness,

00:24:57.065 --> 00:24:58.864
good that you're safe.

00:24:59.225 --> 00:25:01.025
Good that you're safe.

00:25:01.864 --> 00:25:03.424
His Highness is awake.

00:25:03.584 --> 00:25:05.225
His Highness is awake.

00:25:05.465 --> 00:25:07.745
His Highness is really awake.

00:25:08.985 --> 00:25:10.624
Hurry!

00:25:12.424 --> 00:25:14.985
Quiet. Don't disturb His Highness.

00:25:22.144 --> 00:25:23.265
Your Highness,

00:25:23.505 --> 00:25:24.864
please have the meal.

00:25:26.664 --> 00:25:28.025
You may leave.

00:25:28.265 --> 00:25:29.705
I need to be alone.

00:25:30.505 --> 00:25:31.305
Yes.

00:25:33.505 --> 00:25:34.305
Leave.

00:25:34.384 --> 00:25:35.465
All of you, leave.

00:25:57.144 --> 00:25:58.144
Your Highness.

00:25:58.265 --> 00:25:58.904
Your Highness.

00:25:59.025 --> 00:25:59.985
You haven't

00:25:59.985 --> 00:26:00.545
recovered.

00:26:00.624 --> 00:26:01.864
You should return to rest.

00:26:01.944 --> 00:26:02.985
Where is my mother?

00:26:03.344 --> 00:26:03.944
Your Highness,

00:26:04.025 --> 00:26:05.545
please take good rest now.

00:26:05.545 --> 00:26:07.265
Where is my mother?

00:26:07.344 --> 00:26:08.344
I want to see her.

00:26:08.465 --> 00:26:10.904
Your Highness, please return to rest.

00:26:11.745 --> 00:26:13.384
Has something happened to my mother?

00:26:13.545 --> 00:26:15.305
Your Highness, this...

00:26:15.664 --> 00:26:16.584
Go away.

00:26:16.705 --> 00:26:17.465
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

00:26:17.664 --> 00:26:18.705
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

00:26:27.065 --> 00:26:27.825
Mother.

00:26:28.584 --> 00:26:31.265
The Empress has passed away.

00:26:35.985 --> 00:26:39.785
The Empress has passed away.

00:27:30.184 --> 00:27:31.184
Why?

00:27:32.545 --> 00:27:33.944
You want me

00:27:33.944 --> 00:27:36.065
to remain subordinate to a woman?

00:27:36.424 --> 00:27:38.065
She's my mother,

00:27:38.664 --> 00:27:40.384
your legitimate wife.

00:27:40.785 --> 00:27:42.624
How could you do this?

00:27:42.624 --> 00:27:44.025
You have no ambition,

00:27:44.864 --> 00:27:46.624
not fighting for
the Crown Prince position,

00:27:46.705 --> 00:27:47.985
letting that brat

00:27:47.985 --> 00:27:48.745
snatch it away.

00:27:48.944 --> 00:27:49.624
Remember.

00:27:49.825 --> 00:27:51.944
Never compromise with women.

00:27:52.104 --> 00:27:52.785
Don't let them

00:27:52.785 --> 00:27:53.904
trample over you.

00:27:54.144 --> 00:27:56.944
Spare no cost to achieve this.

00:28:00.465 --> 00:28:02.305
I'll kill you now!

00:28:02.424 --> 00:28:03.825
From now on,

00:28:04.584 --> 00:28:05.944
address me as Emperor.

00:28:06.384 --> 00:28:07.184
Remember

00:28:07.584 --> 00:28:09.785
to always respect me.

00:28:09.944 --> 00:28:10.825
Go away.

00:28:11.705 --> 00:28:13.184
I'll kill you!

00:28:20.832 --> 00:28:21.952
Let go!

00:28:44.985 --> 00:28:45.864
Your Majesty,

00:28:46.184 --> 00:28:47.424
I have one thing

00:28:47.465 --> 00:28:48.265
to discuss with you

00:28:48.265 --> 00:28:49.904
and the ministers.

00:28:50.505 --> 00:28:52.265
Okay. Speak freely.

00:28:52.465 --> 00:28:55.104
The Empress's passing
brings national mourning.

00:28:55.465 --> 00:28:56.384
I assume

00:28:56.424 --> 00:28:58.545
you feel sad as well.

00:28:59.344 --> 00:29:01.144
We shared profound marital devotion.

00:29:01.465 --> 00:29:03.104
Through years of marriage,

00:29:03.465 --> 00:29:05.465
how could I not feel sad?

00:29:06.465 --> 00:29:07.505
But this nation

00:29:07.505 --> 00:29:08.785
was her very flesh and blood.

00:29:08.985 --> 00:29:11.104
I must prioritize the nation.

00:29:11.584 --> 00:29:14.384
Only when peace reigns across the land

00:29:14.384 --> 00:29:15.705
and the people prosper,

00:29:15.864 --> 00:29:16.864
will her spirit

00:29:16.864 --> 00:29:18.545
find true rest.

00:29:18.785 --> 00:29:20.904
Your Majesty, I'm impressed

00:29:20.944 --> 00:29:23.184
by your profound devotion.

00:29:23.344 --> 00:29:27.065
Yet I must remind you of a concern.

00:29:27.265 --> 00:29:28.864
The Empress has passed away.

00:29:29.065 --> 00:29:31.825
Protocol demands
the Crown Prince succeed

00:29:31.864 --> 00:29:33.944
to convince the nation.

00:29:37.904 --> 00:29:39.505
Before the Empress passed away,

00:29:39.505 --> 00:29:41.904
she left a verbal decree

00:29:42.104 --> 00:29:43.864
to yield the throne to me.

00:29:44.104 --> 00:29:45.785
The Crown Prince is young,

00:29:45.864 --> 00:29:47.545
not up to the task.

00:29:47.944 --> 00:29:49.745
Though the Crown Prince is young,

00:29:49.825 --> 00:29:53.184
we veteran ministers can support him

00:29:53.384 --> 00:29:54.904
to surely mold him

00:29:54.904 --> 00:29:56.745
into a proper emperor.

00:29:56.825 --> 00:29:59.184
I'm afraid your excuse...

00:30:02.384 --> 00:30:04.384
won't convince the people.

00:30:04.584 --> 00:30:06.184
Indeed.

00:30:06.864 --> 00:30:08.624
It won't convince the people.

00:30:09.144 --> 00:30:09.944
Indeed.

00:30:10.624 --> 00:30:11.624
Outrageous!

00:30:13.265 --> 00:30:14.664
I've long heard rumors

00:30:14.664 --> 00:30:16.025
of rebellion brewing.

00:30:16.265 --> 00:30:18.265
Had I not witnessed it today,

00:30:18.545 --> 00:30:19.904
I'd have doubted it.

00:30:20.265 --> 00:30:21.505
Do you think

00:30:21.505 --> 00:30:22.505
I don't know

00:30:22.505 --> 00:30:23.705
your schemes?

00:30:23.904 --> 00:30:25.424
Should the Crown Prince ascend,

00:30:25.944 --> 00:30:27.584
you ministers would

00:30:27.584 --> 00:30:28.424
control the nation,

00:30:28.584 --> 00:30:30.545
reducing him to a puppet,

00:30:30.624 --> 00:30:32.545
and acting

00:30:32.584 --> 00:30:33.864
without restraint!

00:30:35.904 --> 00:30:37.305
How bold you are

00:30:37.344 --> 00:30:38.265
to say that

00:30:38.265 --> 00:30:39.825
in the court!

00:30:40.025 --> 00:30:40.864
Guards!

00:30:41.025 --> 00:30:42.225
Drag this traitor out

00:30:42.225 --> 00:30:43.424
and behead him publicly.

00:30:44.584 --> 00:30:46.104
This is treason.

00:30:46.584 --> 00:30:49.584
You're usurping power! Deserve death!

00:30:49.785 --> 00:30:52.505
You're usurping power,
harboring wild ambition!

00:30:52.584 --> 00:30:56.584
You're usurping power,
harboring wild ambition!

00:30:57.065 --> 00:30:57.985
From now on,

00:30:58.104 --> 00:31:00.225
anyone who mentions this

00:31:00.384 --> 00:31:02.144
would meet his fate.

00:31:08.864 --> 00:31:10.305
Easy, easy.

00:31:10.465 --> 00:31:11.305
Behave.

00:31:12.104 --> 00:31:13.305
We'll shelter here

00:31:13.384 --> 00:31:14.384
and plan our next move.

00:31:15.465 --> 00:31:16.745
Don't waste your time.

00:31:16.944 --> 00:31:17.864
He's beyond saving.

00:31:17.944 --> 00:31:19.104
Go join him then.

00:31:20.344 --> 00:31:22.144
Second brother, you...

00:31:22.265 --> 00:31:23.025
Seeking death!

00:31:23.065 --> 00:31:23.664
Tan Feng.

00:31:23.904 --> 00:31:25.944
I must go down there.

00:31:26.065 --> 00:31:27.664
Huan Zong got down to save me.

00:31:27.705 --> 00:31:28.305
Kong Hou.

00:31:28.344 --> 00:31:29.424
Huan Zong saved you,

00:31:29.465 --> 00:31:30.944
and now we must save him.

00:31:31.104 --> 00:31:32.305
Don't act impulsively.

00:31:32.384 --> 00:31:33.465
This requires a plan.

00:31:33.465 --> 00:31:34.144
Don't act rashly.

00:31:34.144 --> 00:31:34.944
Or you'd trap

00:31:34.944 --> 00:31:36.025
yourself in there too.

00:31:36.825 --> 00:31:38.465
But I...

00:31:38.545 --> 00:31:40.225
I have

00:31:40.985 --> 00:31:42.344
an idea.

00:31:42.825 --> 00:31:43.624
Say it.

00:31:44.065 --> 00:31:46.424
When we threw those beggars down there,

00:31:46.465 --> 00:31:48.344
we used Mind Stones on them.

00:31:48.505 --> 00:31:49.545
What's that?

00:31:49.545 --> 00:31:52.225
Something to test inner demons.

00:31:52.265 --> 00:31:53.624
The less fierce inner demon,

00:31:53.624 --> 00:31:55.104
the higher survival chances.

00:31:55.225 --> 00:31:56.344
You three could make a test.

00:31:56.424 --> 00:31:58.624
The one with the less fierce inner demon
could go down.

00:31:59.545 --> 00:32:01.344
Give me the Mind Stone.

00:32:06.025 --> 00:32:07.785
Just put your hands on it,

00:32:07.825 --> 00:32:09.344
and you'll know.

00:32:10.624 --> 00:32:11.825
Is this crap

00:32:11.864 --> 00:32:13.144
that amazing?

00:32:14.624 --> 00:32:15.305
Take this.

00:32:27.785 --> 00:32:28.864
A tiger?

00:32:29.225 --> 00:32:31.785
So you fear tigers.

00:32:31.904 --> 00:32:33.184
You understand nothing.

00:32:33.424 --> 00:32:34.465
Quit the nonsense.

00:32:34.505 --> 00:32:35.545
I'll try it.

00:32:50.384 --> 00:32:51.144
What's wrong?

00:32:51.184 --> 00:32:52.785
Tan Feng, what's wrong?

00:32:54.225 --> 00:32:55.184
Nothing.

00:33:09.505 --> 00:33:10.424
Impossible.

00:33:10.745 --> 00:33:12.144
She has no inner demons.

00:33:12.225 --> 00:33:13.144
How's this possible?

00:33:13.265 --> 00:33:14.144
Does that mean

00:33:14.184 --> 00:33:15.584
I can go down to save Huan Zong?

00:33:15.664 --> 00:33:16.344
Absolutely not.

00:33:16.545 --> 00:33:17.344
We don't even know

00:33:17.344 --> 00:33:17.985
if this works.

00:33:18.025 --> 00:33:18.825
Even if it works,

00:33:18.904 --> 00:33:19.624
how would you

00:33:19.624 --> 00:33:20.624
avoid detection?

00:33:22.305 --> 00:33:23.184
What are you doing?

00:33:23.265 --> 00:33:25.144
Lift the spell.

00:33:26.184 --> 00:33:26.745
Talk.

00:33:27.225 --> 00:33:28.424
If you want to go,

00:33:28.825 --> 00:33:30.384
there's a path,

00:33:30.985 --> 00:33:32.305
the Wuchang River

00:33:32.305 --> 00:33:33.184
to Puppet Village.

00:33:33.584 --> 00:33:35.705
But the riverbanks have low trees.

00:33:35.944 --> 00:33:37.505
Flying by sword

00:33:37.705 --> 00:33:39.424
would expose you.

00:33:39.664 --> 00:33:40.624
What about a boat?

00:33:40.705 --> 00:33:41.424
Impossible.

00:33:41.705 --> 00:33:43.104
Absolutely not.

00:33:43.305 --> 00:33:45.225
Boats, rafts...

00:33:45.225 --> 00:33:46.705
All vessels don't work.

00:33:46.864 --> 00:33:47.624
The river's water

00:33:47.624 --> 00:33:48.785
is extremely

00:33:48.904 --> 00:33:50.545
corrosive.

00:33:50.705 --> 00:33:51.985
Stone puppets

00:33:51.985 --> 00:33:53.384
dissolve

00:33:53.584 --> 00:33:54.344
within moments

00:33:54.344 --> 00:33:55.904
in the river.

00:33:56.225 --> 00:33:57.745
Though we dark cultivator

00:33:57.745 --> 00:33:58.785
has spiritual energy

00:33:58.864 --> 00:34:01.584
to protect us from corrosion,

00:34:01.664 --> 00:34:04.144
once you touch the river's water,

00:34:04.225 --> 00:34:05.344
guess what'd happen?

00:34:05.664 --> 00:34:07.424
It's like a thousand insects

00:34:07.424 --> 00:34:08.904
burrowing through your flesh.

00:34:10.944 --> 00:34:11.825
I'll go.

00:34:12.384 --> 00:34:13.825
These are nothing to me.

00:34:14.064 --> 00:34:15.024
Wait.

00:34:15.305 --> 00:34:16.464
Even if you can enter

00:34:16.464 --> 00:34:16.904
undetected,

00:34:16.944 --> 00:34:17.745
how will you remain

00:34:17.825 --> 00:34:19.265
hidden in the village?

00:34:24.544 --> 00:34:25.305
Come on.

00:34:25.504 --> 00:34:26.785
There's no such thing

00:34:26.944 --> 00:34:28.344
as Concealment Pills.

00:34:28.904 --> 00:34:29.745
Tan Feng.

00:34:29.785 --> 00:34:31.384
Stop lying.

00:34:31.464 --> 00:34:32.705
I know the sect provides

00:34:32.745 --> 00:34:33.665
Concealment Pills

00:34:33.665 --> 00:34:35.544
for everyone who goes out for mission.

00:34:35.625 --> 00:34:36.344
It can

00:34:36.344 --> 00:34:38.384
hide one's presence.

00:34:38.464 --> 00:34:40.064
Once taking it,

00:34:40.064 --> 00:34:41.344
one can hide

00:34:41.344 --> 00:34:42.544
his presence.

00:34:42.785 --> 00:34:43.544
Tan Feng.

00:34:43.585 --> 00:34:45.105
You're always out on missions.

00:34:45.105 --> 00:34:45.904
You must have some.

00:34:46.105 --> 00:34:47.585
Who told you this?

00:34:47.825 --> 00:34:49.105
As if it were truth.

00:34:49.464 --> 00:34:50.504
Stop fooling me

00:34:50.504 --> 00:34:52.585
around.

00:34:52.665 --> 00:34:53.745
I know you have some.

00:34:53.864 --> 00:34:55.265
Even if you refuse me,

00:34:55.504 --> 00:34:56.864
I'll still go.

00:35:00.984 --> 00:35:02.504
I know what you are thinking about.

00:35:03.464 --> 00:35:04.185
But I couldn't

00:35:04.185 --> 00:35:05.064
let you go down there

00:35:05.225 --> 00:35:06.305
just because

00:35:06.305 --> 00:35:06.984
he saved you.

00:35:06.984 --> 00:35:07.904
Tan Feng.

00:35:07.944 --> 00:35:09.424
I know you care for me.

00:35:09.745 --> 00:35:10.544
But...

00:35:10.745 --> 00:35:12.064
Look,

00:35:12.145 --> 00:35:13.185
my cultivation's advanced

00:35:13.185 --> 00:35:13.825
significantly.

00:35:13.825 --> 00:35:15.024
And I have spiritual tools

00:35:15.024 --> 00:35:15.785
for protection.

00:35:15.785 --> 00:35:17.064
If you use Concealment Pills,

00:35:17.064 --> 00:35:18.344
you can't use spiritual tools.

00:35:18.504 --> 00:35:19.625
Once spiritual energy used,

00:35:19.625 --> 00:35:20.625
you'll get exposed.

00:35:20.705 --> 00:35:22.504
But I'm blessed

00:35:22.504 --> 00:35:23.625
with fortune.

00:35:23.745 --> 00:35:24.424
Forgot it?

00:35:24.464 --> 00:35:25.585
Don't worry.

00:35:25.665 --> 00:35:28.344
I will be definitely fine.

00:35:28.424 --> 00:35:29.384
Besides,

00:35:29.504 --> 00:35:30.504
you and Master taught me

00:35:30.544 --> 00:35:32.145
since childhood

00:35:32.145 --> 00:35:32.825
that

00:35:32.825 --> 00:35:34.904
I have to act
with loyalty and sincerity.

00:35:35.145 --> 00:35:36.625
Huan Zong took risks saving me.

00:35:36.625 --> 00:35:38.145
How could I abandon him

00:35:38.185 --> 00:35:39.344
now?

00:35:41.225 --> 00:35:42.024
Tan Feng.

00:35:42.265 --> 00:35:44.265
Please help me.

00:35:46.904 --> 00:35:47.625
Remember.

00:35:47.825 --> 00:35:49.105
The pill's effect is temporary.

00:35:49.305 --> 00:35:50.145
Once it expires,

00:35:50.145 --> 00:35:51.384
go back immediately.

00:35:51.424 --> 00:35:52.464
Be swift.

00:35:52.585 --> 00:35:53.864
Never use spiritual energy.

00:35:53.864 --> 00:35:55.305
Or you'll get caught.

00:35:57.424 --> 00:35:58.344
Understood.

00:36:17.265 --> 00:36:19.665
Tan Feng, Lin Hu.

00:36:20.024 --> 00:36:21.424
Wait for my good news.

00:36:22.544 --> 00:36:23.464
Kong Hou.

00:36:24.024 --> 00:36:25.904
I...

00:36:27.904 --> 00:36:29.944
Pity that I'm a demon cultivator,

00:36:30.024 --> 00:36:31.705
so I couldn't rescue him myself.

00:36:31.904 --> 00:36:32.424
I...

00:36:32.544 --> 00:36:33.785
Alright.

00:36:34.145 --> 00:36:35.344
Huan Zong took risks

00:36:35.424 --> 00:36:36.585
saving me.

00:36:37.064 --> 00:36:38.064
No matter what,

00:36:38.424 --> 00:36:40.145
I must bring him back.

00:36:40.585 --> 00:36:41.504
Kong Hou.

00:36:42.225 --> 00:36:43.625
- Kong Hou.
- Be careful.

00:37:21.864 --> 00:37:22.785
Bring Young Master

00:37:22.785 --> 00:37:23.544
back.

00:37:23.785 --> 00:37:24.145
Kong Hou,

00:37:24.145 --> 00:37:25.665
bring him back.
