00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.480
Dad

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:38.680
Ruyi

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.960
You're awake

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.960
Come here

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.680
Come here

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.120
Come

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.200
Eating corn? Come over

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.880
This corn is delicious

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.920
Try it

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.800
How is it?

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.480
Sweet

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.760
Dad

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.480
Ting Xuan and I came back to see you

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.080
Dad

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.760
Ruyi

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.200
Just went to the doctor

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.560
Jiu'er is pregnant

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.920
That's great

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.120
Ruyi, go tell everyone quickly

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.360
Set up tents, serve porridge

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.560
I want to earn merit for my grandson

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.840
Okay

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:45.480
Ruyi

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.840
Why not let Jin Shisan come pay respects to Dad

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.480
For our Yang family's future son-in-law

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.200
Save a wedding candy

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.640
Right?

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.080
Okay

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.760
Sounds good

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.720
Brother, you're a father now

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.120
Still not serious

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.200
Well

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.200
She's getting shy now

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.200
Come

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.640
Come, slow down

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.200
Slow down, slow down

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.000
Haiyue

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:32.080
Alright, alright

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.080
Haiyue

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:49.240
Bao Bao

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:50.080
Flowers

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.520
And tasty food

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:56.560
Sit down, sit down

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:01.840
All my favorites

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:02.680
You try one first

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.840
Is it good?

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.000
It's good

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.680
I got this at Hao's Butcher Shop

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.960
Waited a long time to buy it

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.400
All your favorites

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.840
Pig's head, pig ears, and pig feet

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.280
Eat more

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:20.240
Come

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:26.920
I heard, I heard

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.680
It's moving

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.480
Just like his dad

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.520
Never proper

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.960
So naughty

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.400
Must be a big chubby boy

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.680
Dad

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.240
Jiu'er, look

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.640
Dad brought us a big gift

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.680
Only this rarest ginseng

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.800
Is worthy of my eldest grandson

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.520
So mysterious

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:46.640
Open it and see

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.280
Phoenix's Single Tear

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:59.400
Dad

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.680
This is too precious

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.640
Dad

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.560
It's fine, it's fine

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.240
Didn't you sell it?

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.680
Ruyi

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:07.680
What nonsense

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.800
This is the world's one and only ginseng

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:10.920
Who could afford it?

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:11.520
Silly girl

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:11.960
Exactly

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:12.680
Didn't sell it?

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.800
Thank you, Dad

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:14.840
Thank you, Dad

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.000
Dad, you're so good to your grandson

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.080
Of course

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:19.960
Wait, that's not right

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.000
When he grows up

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:21.960
He'll surely honor you

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.640
I remember I sold it

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.640
Sold it to Boss He

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.640
Phoenix's Single Tear

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:32.400
Brother

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:34.760
Brother

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.680
I got this at the Earth Temple

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.800
It's very effective

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.760
Before, with Brother Jin

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.280
When we dug for Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.240
I wore it then

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.560
Now you wear it

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:15.400
Alright

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.920
So this amulet is with me

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.360
You have to stick with me

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.120
You're not my Bao Bao

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.000
My Bao Bao

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.360
He's not as perfect as you

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.960
Nor such fancy clothes

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.120
Never gave me flowers

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:43.840
Haiyue

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:44.640
But

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.360
He's the Bao Bao who loves me most

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:53.480
I want to find him

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:06.640
Dad

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:08.960
You're finally taking Xing'er and me on a ginseng expedition

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:10.840
Let me show you my skills

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:12.640
Look at you, so capable

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.040
Just be a proper Flank Guard

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:17.640
It's time

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.200
Let's head out

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:21.040
Dad

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.440
Your pocket watch

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.400
Didn't you sell it?

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.280
Which eye saw me sell it?

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.960
This is our Jin family's heirloom

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:32.280
I'll pass it to you someday

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:33.400
What?

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:34.400
Want to see it?

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.960
A dragon's whiskers hang pearls

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.880
Pack up, let's go

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:11.960
Dad

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:13.640
Xing'er

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.080
I can't go with you

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.200
Why can't you go?

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.400
Why not?

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:25.080
Dad

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:29.080
I've waited day and night

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:31.760
Just for you to say this

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:34.960
I want to be your Flank Guard

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.080
When wolves and tigers attack

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:39.200
I can protect you

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.200
I want to be your right-hand man

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:44.720
Watching your back

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:45.840
I feel most at ease

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:47.960
I want to be your point man.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.200
Dig up the biggest ginseng
to honor you.

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.080
But...

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:57.200
I...

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.960
I'll never join you
on a ginseng expedition again.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:04.600
Brother...

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.320
What are you talking about?

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.040
What do you mean, no more chances?

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.320
Dad always said he'd take you.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:12.720
Xing'er...

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.080
I'm useless.

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:19.880
I failed to protect you.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.040
I'm sorry I let you down.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:25.720
Remember...

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:28.600
Stay by Dad's side.

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:34.040
I hope you'll be happy.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:35.400
Content.

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:37.440
And safe.

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.520
I don't understand
what you're saying.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:45.200
Let's go.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:46.760
Stop talking nonsense.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:47.720
Time's up.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:48.400
Let's hurry and go.

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:49.080
Come on, brother.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:49.760
Let's go.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:50.760
I can't go anymore.

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.200
I know this is a dream.

00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.440
I wish I could stay
in this dream.

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:02.520
But dreams...

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.200
always end when you wake up.

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:08.760
Dad...

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:11.760
Jin Shisan regrets
his past choices.

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:15.080
I didn't enter the Mountain God Temple
with you that day.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.160
I never thought
that farewell at the temple

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.840
would be our last
in this world.

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:25.600
Jin Shisan has missed you
day and night.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:27.440
To see you today

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.520
is a blessing
I thank the heavens for.

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.760
But my time is up too.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.760
I have to go my own way now.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:49.520
Jin Shisan will remember
your teachings and our family creed.

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:54.440
This is farewell.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:57.880
Oh, Dad...

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:03.400
I've found someone
who matters to me.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:06.760
Don't worry, Dad.

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:09.960
I'll live well.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.040
If your spirit is watching
from above,

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:15.440
even if we're worlds apart,

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:19.200
please bring Xing'er

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:23.640
to visit me in my dreams.

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:00.400
Ruyi...

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:18.600
Jin Shisan...

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.840
Jin Shisan, how is he?

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:27.520
Jin Shisan...

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:36.280
Go check on him.

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:37.640
Go.

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:43.400
Haiyue...

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:46.760
Sister Ruyi...

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:48.960
How is he?

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:52.760
Bao Bao...

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:07.440
Bao Bao...

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:09.280
Bao Bao...

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:10.600
Bao...

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:13.960
Bao Bao...

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:17.760
Bao Bao...

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:20.040
It hurts! Hurts, hurts!

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.040
Where does it hurt?

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:38.320
I have the Divine Dragon's
Twin-Incense Ginseng.

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:40.840
The Nine Immortals' Compass.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.760
Do you know what
the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng is?

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.520
This is the Divine Dragon's
Twin-Incense Ginseng.

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:49.840
They're all mine.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:53.320
Compass...

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.520
Chicken soup's here!

00:15:58.960 --> 00:15:59.520
Bao Bao...

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:00.720
Lie down, lie down.

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:11.640
Come.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:16.160
Let me tuck you in.

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:20.280
Does it taste good?

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:21.520
It's good.

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:30.400
Have you thought of
the baby's name?

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:32.600
I've already decided.

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:34.640
What's the name?

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:37.200
We'll call him...

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:39.080
Lord Yan.

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:42.520
Are you serious?

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:43.960
Isn't it a good name?

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.520
From now on, whoever meets our child

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:46.640
will have to call him "Grandpa."

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:47.520
Grandpa...

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:51.440
Grandpa...

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:53.960
Grandpa, Grandpa...

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:54.840
Grandpa...

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:22.560
Look at me again.

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:23.840
The ginseng is about to run away!
