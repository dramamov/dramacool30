(Yongning Gate)

00:02:02.848 --> 00:02:03.928
Your Highness,

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:05.649
it's about the time.

00:02:18.816 --> 00:02:19.774
(Imperial Decree)

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:26.728
The First Prince

00:02:27.608 --> 00:02:29.209
served as the Grand General,

00:02:29.608 --> 00:02:31.089
commanding troops beyond the capital.

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.209
His duty was to safeguard the realm,

00:02:33.529 --> 00:02:35.489
yet he harbored treasonous ambitions

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.049
and led armies to assault the capital,

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.209
plotting regicide.

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:43.529
This is high treason.

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:45.969
Unforgivable crimes!

00:02:46.408 --> 00:02:47.769
Strip all his noble titles.

00:02:47.888 --> 00:02:49.209
Demote him to commoner status.

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:51.209
Execute him immediately.

00:02:57.688 --> 00:02:59.408
That stupid emperor

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.529
usurped the throne through regicide.

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:04.448
He is a ruler devoid of mercy, kindness,

00:03:04.568 --> 00:03:05.848
and loyalty!

00:03:06.408 --> 00:03:08.369
Yet he dares slander me?

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:10.329
Ridiculous.

00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:12.969
My return with troops

00:03:13.249 --> 00:03:14.888
was rightful and just.

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:17.408
My regret lies only in haste,

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:19.969
failing to claim your head.

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:22.168
(Execute)
Even if I die today,

00:03:22.568 --> 00:03:24.049
heaven's justice prevails.

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:25.969
You won't escape retribution.

00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:45.408
Brother,

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.249
I've come to bid you farewell.

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:51.049
Huan Zong,

00:03:53.288 --> 00:03:54.608
protect yourself.

00:03:54.929 --> 00:03:56.168
Protect our younger brother.

00:04:05.408 --> 00:04:06.369
I promise.

00:04:12.568 --> 00:04:13.288
Execute!

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:46.928
Zong,

00:04:48.168 --> 00:04:50.209
Zong, what's wrong?

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:54.168
Zong,

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:55.808
Mother

00:04:56.209 --> 00:04:57.689
has gone.

00:04:58.048 --> 00:05:00.408
Did I fail to meet expectations,

00:05:00.728 --> 00:05:02.248
so the First Prince

00:05:02.649 --> 00:05:04.569
opposed my succession,

00:05:05.048 --> 00:05:06.689
thus staged this rebellion?

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:07.969
Who told you this?

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:11.009
Father told me this.

00:05:19.368 --> 00:05:20.608
Do you trust me?

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:22.529
Yes.

00:05:22.649 --> 00:05:24.488
I trust you above all.

00:05:26.168 --> 00:05:27.449
Did the First Prince

00:05:27.808 --> 00:05:29.889
really rebel because of me?

00:05:33.408 --> 00:05:34.608
Trust me.

00:05:35.928 --> 00:05:37.209
He loved you dearly.

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:39.608
This has nothing to do with you.

00:05:40.408 --> 00:05:41.368
Don't blame yourself.

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:42.608
Okay?

00:05:48.248 --> 00:05:49.569
From now on,

00:05:50.209 --> 00:05:51.689
I'll protect you in the capital.

00:06:09.928 --> 00:06:10.848
These...

00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:12.928
So many dark cultivator corpses

00:06:13.048 --> 00:06:14.769
and those beggar puppets.

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:16.728
They were all discarded here.

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:17.848
Huan Zong?

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:19.928
Huan Zong, where are you?

00:06:20.048 --> 00:06:22.089
Please be safe.

00:06:25.808 --> 00:06:26.728
Huan Zong?

00:06:31.048 --> 00:06:31.889
Huan Zong.

00:06:44.848 --> 00:06:46.649
Huan Zong, wake up.

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:48.129
I'm Kong Hou.

00:06:50.168 --> 00:06:50.889
Let's go.

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:52.449
I'm taking you out of here.

00:06:53.209 --> 00:06:55.248
Even with his body recovered,

00:06:55.248 --> 00:06:56.569
without conquering inner demons,

00:06:56.608 --> 00:06:58.209
he'll remain in catatonia

00:06:58.209 --> 00:06:59.329
or perish.

00:07:17.009 --> 00:07:18.649
So this is your inner demon.

00:07:19.848 --> 00:07:21.048
Wait here.

00:07:47.209 --> 00:07:48.449
How peculiar.

00:07:48.569 --> 00:07:49.329
Could it be

00:07:49.329 --> 00:07:51.089
only I could perceive that enchantment?

00:08:02.784 --> 00:08:04.000
(Laundry Bureau)

00:08:09.649 --> 00:08:11.408
This is weird.

00:08:11.889 --> 00:08:15.009
This is clearly the imperial palace.

00:08:15.168 --> 00:08:16.288
How could his inner demon

00:08:16.288 --> 00:08:17.889
be tied to the imperial palace?

00:08:18.408 --> 00:08:20.248
Was he once a eunuch?

00:08:21.769 --> 00:08:23.529
No. It's impossible.

00:08:23.728 --> 00:08:25.048
Huan Zong must have been

00:08:25.048 --> 00:08:26.209
at least a palace guard.

00:08:26.689 --> 00:08:27.848
No matter what,

00:08:28.168 --> 00:08:29.608
I'll find him first.

00:08:30.769 --> 00:08:32.049
Who's there?

00:08:33.089 --> 00:08:34.089
There's no one.

00:08:34.089 --> 00:08:34.888
You saw wrong.

00:08:34.888 --> 00:08:35.648
Get back to work.

00:08:45.848 --> 00:08:46.488
This...

00:09:07.289 --> 00:09:08.528
- I'm coming.
- Your Majesty.

00:09:08.528 --> 00:09:09.689
I'm coming.

00:09:10.528 --> 00:09:11.648
No escaping now.

00:09:11.648 --> 00:09:12.169
Your Majesty.

00:09:12.169 --> 00:09:12.888
Where are you?

00:09:12.888 --> 00:09:14.049
- I'm coming.
- I'm here.

00:09:14.049 --> 00:09:15.248
Your Majesty.

00:09:15.409 --> 00:09:17.248
My beauty! I'm coming!

00:09:17.248 --> 00:09:18.488
I'm right here.

00:09:18.488 --> 00:09:19.528
You're here.

00:09:19.528 --> 00:09:20.289
I got you.

00:09:20.289 --> 00:09:21.689
- Your Majesty.
- I got you.

00:09:21.689 --> 00:09:22.368
Your Majesty.

00:09:23.648 --> 00:09:24.289
My beauty.

00:09:24.289 --> 00:09:25.449
Father,

00:09:25.608 --> 00:09:26.969
the traitor has been executed.

00:09:32.728 --> 00:09:33.728
What did he say?

00:09:33.728 --> 00:09:35.169
Did he confess before dying?

00:09:35.689 --> 00:09:38.248
The traitor died
without acknowledging guilt.

00:09:38.728 --> 00:09:40.569
He believed himself innocent.

00:09:42.329 --> 00:09:43.888
He's just stubborn.

00:09:46.409 --> 00:09:47.848
And what do you think?

00:09:47.969 --> 00:09:49.209
Is he guilty or not?

00:09:55.569 --> 00:09:56.888
I believe

00:09:57.888 --> 00:09:58.848
he is guilty.

00:10:02.648 --> 00:10:04.368
Good that you know he's guilty.

00:10:04.449 --> 00:10:05.848
You're wiser than him.

00:10:05.969 --> 00:10:07.488
But remember this well.

00:10:07.648 --> 00:10:09.488
Don't repeat his mistakes.

00:10:11.128 --> 00:10:12.289
Your Majesty,

00:10:12.289 --> 00:10:13.768
please have some tea.

00:10:18.089 --> 00:10:19.049
My beauty,

00:10:19.368 --> 00:10:20.209
why haven't I

00:10:20.209 --> 00:10:21.569
noticed you before?

00:10:22.329 --> 00:10:22.888
Alright.

00:10:23.049 --> 00:10:25.128
You'll serve me from now on.

00:10:25.128 --> 00:10:26.728
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:10:27.848 --> 00:10:28.728
So beautiful.

00:10:30.969 --> 00:10:33.768
Congratulations on finding
a new consort.

00:10:34.248 --> 00:10:35.689
Okay. Go attend to your duties.

00:10:36.488 --> 00:10:37.888
I'll take my leave.

00:10:40.929 --> 00:10:41.728
Your Majesty,

00:10:41.888 --> 00:10:44.008
time for the elixir.

00:10:44.929 --> 00:10:46.528
Let me feed you, Your Majesty.

00:10:46.768 --> 00:10:47.929
Good.

00:11:08.209 --> 00:11:09.608
From now on,

00:11:09.608 --> 00:11:12.008
you shall be my consort.

00:11:12.728 --> 00:11:14.008
I dressed meticulously

00:11:14.008 --> 00:11:15.449
every day just to see him.

00:11:15.528 --> 00:11:16.409
No matter how late,

00:11:16.409 --> 00:11:17.848
I'd wash and prepare,

00:11:17.848 --> 00:11:19.409
rising before dawn to work.

00:11:19.409 --> 00:11:20.289
Yet he

00:11:20.289 --> 00:11:21.648
never even glanced at me

00:11:21.648 --> 00:11:22.929
and told me to stop dreaming.

00:11:23.368 --> 00:11:24.528
What's so special about him?

00:11:24.528 --> 00:11:25.329
I'm a palace maid.

00:11:25.329 --> 00:11:26.488
He's just a guard.

00:11:27.569 --> 00:11:28.768
All guards are the same.

00:11:28.768 --> 00:11:29.848
They look down on us.

00:11:29.929 --> 00:11:31.409
They just dress fancier

00:11:31.409 --> 00:11:32.689
and get paid more,

00:11:32.689 --> 00:11:34.449
but in the end,
they're still just servants.

00:11:34.449 --> 00:11:35.569
Exactly!

00:11:35.969 --> 00:11:36.969
It's okay.

00:11:38.929 --> 00:11:40.248
Ladies,

00:11:40.368 --> 00:11:41.569
may I ask something?

00:11:41.728 --> 00:11:43.329
Do you know

00:11:43.329 --> 00:11:44.969
a guard named Huan Zong?

00:11:45.169 --> 00:11:46.329
There are too many guards.

00:11:46.329 --> 00:11:48.089
How could I know all their names?

00:11:48.569 --> 00:11:49.809
That's true.

00:11:50.089 --> 00:11:50.809
Oh, right.

00:11:50.888 --> 00:11:51.648
He looks

00:11:51.648 --> 00:11:52.569
exceptionally handsome.

00:11:53.329 --> 00:11:54.209
I might know

00:11:54.209 --> 00:11:55.488
some good-looking ones.

00:11:55.768 --> 00:11:57.209
But I haven't heard

00:11:57.209 --> 00:11:58.608
that name you mentioned.

00:11:59.169 --> 00:12:00.648
Did you see that in some

00:12:00.768 --> 00:12:01.848
lovesick dreams you had

00:12:01.848 --> 00:12:03.209
when you couldn't sleep?

00:12:04.008 --> 00:12:04.608
I...

00:12:10.888 --> 00:12:12.248
I'm exhausted today.

00:12:12.329 --> 00:12:13.888
Got scolded by the matron again.

00:12:16.929 --> 00:12:18.209
His Majesty just executed

00:12:18.209 --> 00:12:19.689
the rebellious First Prince.

00:12:19.848 --> 00:12:20.768
Only the Second Prince

00:12:20.768 --> 00:12:22.329
- I'm spent.
- and the Crown Prince remain now.

00:12:22.329 --> 00:12:23.569
In the end,

00:12:23.569 --> 00:12:25.209
it's just gossip.

00:12:25.209 --> 00:12:27.488
No useful information at all.

00:12:29.289 --> 00:12:30.569
They say

00:12:30.569 --> 00:12:31.329
the First Prince

00:12:31.329 --> 00:12:32.488
never actually rebelled.

00:12:32.488 --> 00:12:33.528
It was just because...

00:12:33.648 --> 00:12:34.848
I also heard

00:12:34.848 --> 00:12:36.569
the late Empress didn't

00:12:36.569 --> 00:12:37.569
die of illness.

00:12:37.569 --> 00:12:38.169
She was...

00:12:41.809 --> 00:12:43.128
She was murdered

00:12:43.169 --> 00:12:44.209
by her consort,

00:12:44.209 --> 00:12:45.169
the current Emperor.

00:12:46.368 --> 00:12:48.209
So the First Prince came back

00:12:48.209 --> 00:12:49.169
to seek revenge.

00:12:49.289 --> 00:12:50.488
But His Majesty was prepared

00:12:50.488 --> 00:12:51.368
and exposed his plan.

00:12:51.368 --> 00:12:52.848
To make an example of him,

00:12:52.848 --> 00:12:54.848
he asked Second Prince
to oversee the execution.

00:12:54.848 --> 00:12:56.648
Brothers slaughter each other.

00:12:56.888 --> 00:12:58.008
Now the Second Prince

00:12:58.008 --> 00:12:59.409
must be thoroughly terrified.

00:12:59.528 --> 00:13:00.689
He wouldn't dare disobey.

00:13:00.929 --> 00:13:02.289
I heard

00:13:02.289 --> 00:13:03.449
the Crown Prince isn't even

00:13:03.449 --> 00:13:04.689
His Majesty's biological son.

00:13:04.848 --> 00:13:06.248
And now, he is so young.

00:13:06.248 --> 00:13:07.368
(How come what they're saying)

00:13:07.368 --> 00:13:08.728
(sounds so much like)

00:13:08.728 --> 00:13:09.689
(what chronicles wrote)

00:13:09.689 --> 00:13:10.648
(about Lingyou royalty?)

00:13:11.209 --> 00:13:12.689
(But the late Empress was killed)

00:13:12.689 --> 00:13:14.289
(by her consort over 300 years ago.)

00:13:14.848 --> 00:13:16.848
(Is this truly Huan Zong's inner demon?)

00:13:17.152 --> 00:13:18.689
(How could his inner demon connect)

00:13:18.689 --> 00:13:20.449
(to royal affairs from 300 years ago?)

00:13:20.449 --> 00:13:22.128
Which department do you work in?

00:13:22.128 --> 00:13:23.608
Your face looks unfamiliar.

00:13:23.969 --> 00:13:26.049
I don't recall seeing you before.

00:13:26.969 --> 00:13:28.329
I'm responsible

00:13:28.329 --> 00:13:29.648
for the laundry.

00:13:30.689 --> 00:13:32.368
We're all laundry workers here.

00:13:34.089 --> 00:13:35.689
I-I just

00:13:35.689 --> 00:13:37.089
woke up groggy this morning.

00:13:37.089 --> 00:13:38.289
I mean

00:13:38.329 --> 00:13:39.728
I'm from another palace.

00:13:39.728 --> 00:13:41.169
Our matron sent me

00:13:41.169 --> 00:13:42.848
to deliver pastries for everyone.

00:13:43.929 --> 00:13:45.449
Which matron would that be?

00:13:46.488 --> 00:13:48.248
You know the matron.

00:13:48.248 --> 00:13:49.528
Who else could it be,

00:13:49.528 --> 00:13:50.169
right?

00:13:50.368 --> 00:13:51.648
I-I...

00:13:53.488 --> 00:13:54.089
These

00:13:54.089 --> 00:13:55.528
are the treats the matron

00:13:55.528 --> 00:13:56.648
sent me to deliver.

00:13:56.768 --> 00:13:57.648
I need to return now

00:13:57.648 --> 00:13:58.768
and report back to her.

00:13:58.768 --> 00:13:59.569
I'm leaving now.

00:13:59.569 --> 00:14:01.089
I'll visit again.

00:14:01.969 --> 00:14:02.768
You...

00:14:04.449 --> 00:14:06.329
Alright. Go back and have some rest.

00:14:06.768 --> 00:14:08.728
I shall stay by your side.

00:14:08.848 --> 00:14:10.248
Should you need anything,

00:14:10.248 --> 00:14:12.569
I'll attend to you immediately.

00:14:12.569 --> 00:14:14.569
It would be shameful to neglect you.

00:14:17.289 --> 00:14:18.248
Perfect.

00:14:18.848 --> 00:14:20.368
I just remembered something

00:14:20.368 --> 00:14:22.089
requiring your immediate attention.

00:14:22.488 --> 00:14:24.329
Your wish is my command.

00:14:24.488 --> 00:14:26.248
When reporting to His Majesty

00:14:26.648 --> 00:14:28.969
about the rebel executions today,

00:14:29.128 --> 00:14:30.728
I noticed his chambers were filled

00:14:30.728 --> 00:14:32.409
with stunning female companions.

00:14:32.608 --> 00:14:33.969
Some of them

00:14:33.969 --> 00:14:36.049
were breathtakingly beautiful.

00:14:36.128 --> 00:14:37.648
I thought to myself

00:14:37.728 --> 00:14:39.049
if I could have such beauties

00:14:39.169 --> 00:14:41.608
attending to me,

00:14:41.768 --> 00:14:43.368
it would be marvelous.

00:14:43.848 --> 00:14:44.929
But naturally,

00:14:45.368 --> 00:14:47.089
those peerless women belong

00:14:47.089 --> 00:14:48.728
with His Majesty.

00:14:49.008 --> 00:14:50.329
Settling for the next best thing,

00:14:50.488 --> 00:14:51.888
if I could settle

00:14:51.888 --> 00:14:53.049
for slightly less dazzling

00:14:53.169 --> 00:14:55.608
yet equally skilled companions,

00:14:56.008 --> 00:14:58.329
it would make nights more bearable.

00:14:58.488 --> 00:15:00.209
No need to explain, Your Highness.

00:15:00.289 --> 00:15:01.689
I know what to do.

00:15:01.809 --> 00:15:03.608
I'll personally handle it.

00:15:05.329 --> 00:15:06.929
Thank you.

00:15:07.209 --> 00:15:09.008
But if they could arrive tonight,

00:15:09.008 --> 00:15:09.809
that would be great.

00:15:09.809 --> 00:15:11.008
Consider it done.

00:15:11.008 --> 00:15:12.368
Grant me two hours,

00:15:12.528 --> 00:15:14.289
and you'll be pleased.

00:15:19.768 --> 00:15:21.368
Any suspicious movements from him?

00:15:22.368 --> 00:15:23.768
I failed.

00:15:23.768 --> 00:15:25.809
I lost the Second Prince's trail.

00:15:25.809 --> 00:15:26.648
Useless!

00:15:28.768 --> 00:15:29.929
He claimed

00:15:29.929 --> 00:15:31.128
to have dropped something

00:15:31.209 --> 00:15:32.648
and sent guards searching.

00:15:33.248 --> 00:15:35.008
But it was dark.

00:15:35.128 --> 00:15:36.528
I turned around

00:15:36.648 --> 00:15:38.409
just to find him vanished.

00:15:38.689 --> 00:15:40.289
Where exactly?

00:15:40.289 --> 00:15:41.528
Near the imperial garden.

00:15:43.648 --> 00:15:45.689
He must be meeting someone there.

00:15:45.689 --> 00:15:48.449
Maybe it was the First Prince's faction.

00:15:48.569 --> 00:15:49.809
But I heard

00:15:49.809 --> 00:15:50.409
they've always

00:15:50.409 --> 00:15:51.969
only obeyed the First Prince.

00:15:52.089 --> 00:15:54.848
Now, he's actually managed
to recruit them?

00:15:55.248 --> 00:15:56.049
But

00:15:56.049 --> 00:15:58.008
when I went to see
the Second Prince later,

00:15:58.008 --> 00:15:58.929
I encountered one

00:15:58.929 --> 00:15:59.969
of his eunuchs,

00:16:00.089 --> 00:16:01.209
who was about to send people

00:16:01.209 --> 00:16:02.248
out on errands.

00:16:02.368 --> 00:16:04.368
They said it was
to find beauties to serve

00:16:04.368 --> 00:16:05.368
the Second Prince.

00:16:05.528 --> 00:16:06.929
Out of nowhere,

00:16:07.049 --> 00:16:08.929
wanting to find beauties?

00:16:09.368 --> 00:16:10.569
Who would believe that?

00:16:10.929 --> 00:16:12.728
I must catch him red-handed

00:16:12.728 --> 00:16:15.008
and charge him with treason on the spot.

00:16:15.128 --> 00:16:16.888
Someone! Prepare the carriage!

00:16:18.329 --> 00:16:19.209
Yes, Your Highness.

00:16:23.008 --> 00:16:24.488
The imperial palace is enormous.

00:16:24.648 --> 00:16:25.888
I've walked so far,

00:16:25.969 --> 00:16:26.888
but haven't seen any

00:16:26.888 --> 00:16:28.169
guards' quarters.

00:16:28.488 --> 00:16:29.648
Could it be the guards

00:16:29.648 --> 00:16:31.008
all live outside the palace?

00:16:32.728 --> 00:16:34.089
My legs are killing me.

00:16:34.888 --> 00:16:36.128
Late at night,

00:16:36.569 --> 00:16:38.608
the palace is heavily guarded.

00:16:39.049 --> 00:16:40.689
Without using spiritual energy,

00:16:40.809 --> 00:16:42.209
how should I search?

00:16:42.209 --> 00:16:44.169
Where should I go?

00:16:47.169 --> 00:16:48.409
I'm starving.

00:16:48.728 --> 00:16:51.368
Maybe I should take a nap.

00:16:51.648 --> 00:16:53.008
Once I'm asleep,

00:16:53.528 --> 00:16:55.728
maybe I'll dream of something tasty.

00:16:57.289 --> 00:16:58.888
Where should I sleep?

00:17:02.929 --> 00:17:04.449
There's a tree here.

00:17:36.409 --> 00:17:37.248
Your Highness,

00:17:37.528 --> 00:17:39.169
besides the eunuch just now,

00:17:39.328 --> 00:17:40.849
there are still many in the palace

00:17:40.849 --> 00:17:42.209
following me.

00:17:42.369 --> 00:17:43.609
Time is pressing.

00:17:44.728 --> 00:17:46.129
The First Prince's military power

00:17:46.129 --> 00:17:47.048
has been stripped away,

00:17:47.288 --> 00:17:48.528
but all generals

00:17:48.528 --> 00:17:49.369
from Northwest Camp

00:17:49.488 --> 00:17:50.849
only follow his orders.

00:17:51.008 --> 00:17:52.048
He once instructed us

00:17:52.169 --> 00:17:53.568
that if his elimination failed,

00:17:53.728 --> 00:17:55.048
we should faithfully serve you.

00:17:56.209 --> 00:17:57.528
This is the First Prince's token.

00:17:57.768 --> 00:17:58.849
With this,

00:17:58.969 --> 00:18:00.008
you can command

00:18:00.008 --> 00:18:01.728
the vast forces of the Northwest Camp.

00:18:01.849 --> 00:18:03.528
Now that my brother is gone,

00:18:04.008 --> 00:18:05.889
we must plan carefully.

00:18:06.649 --> 00:18:08.048
When the time comes,

00:18:08.288 --> 00:18:10.008
the situation will reverse.

00:18:52.088 --> 00:18:52.889
Huan Zong?

00:18:53.008 --> 00:18:53.889
Huan Zong.

00:18:54.328 --> 00:18:55.609
It really is you!

00:19:00.568 --> 00:19:01.248
Huan Zong,

00:19:01.449 --> 00:19:02.969
let's get out of here now.

00:19:05.088 --> 00:19:05.929
Let go.

00:19:07.169 --> 00:19:08.169
I won't.

00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:11.209
You don't know how hard

00:19:11.209 --> 00:19:12.609
I've worked to find you.

00:19:12.609 --> 00:19:14.609
I've searched for ages!

00:19:16.288 --> 00:19:17.929
Get off me first.

00:19:27.248 --> 00:19:28.528
Who are you?

00:19:28.528 --> 00:19:30.449
How dare you address me by name?

00:19:30.728 --> 00:19:31.609
Huan Zong,

00:19:31.609 --> 00:19:33.248
don't you remember me?

00:19:38.528 --> 00:19:39.248
Get up.

00:19:40.169 --> 00:19:40.768
Come here.

00:19:45.169 --> 00:19:47.169
Are you another spy sent by my father?

00:19:47.649 --> 00:19:48.649
What?

00:19:50.689 --> 00:19:51.728
Don't speak.

00:19:51.728 --> 00:19:52.728
Don't move.

00:20:14.209 --> 00:20:15.808
Isn't this Consort Qi?

00:20:15.969 --> 00:20:17.328
You just got your promotion.

00:20:17.328 --> 00:20:18.048
What brings you

00:20:18.048 --> 00:20:19.288
out for a nighttime stroll?

00:20:19.288 --> 00:20:19.849
I...

00:20:19.969 --> 00:20:22.169
I was walking to aid digestion.

00:20:22.328 --> 00:20:23.808
Second Prince, w-what

00:20:23.969 --> 00:20:25.849
are you doing here?

00:20:26.768 --> 00:20:28.129
(Second Prince?)

00:20:28.328 --> 00:20:29.929
(So Huan Zong isn't a guard.)

00:20:29.929 --> 00:20:31.568
(He's the Second Prince
of Lingyou Realm?)

00:20:31.689 --> 00:20:33.449
Don't you see?

00:20:33.568 --> 00:20:34.728
On such a lovely night,

00:20:34.728 --> 00:20:35.929
naturally, I'm spending time

00:20:35.929 --> 00:20:36.849
with a beauty.

00:20:37.008 --> 00:20:38.849
(Why does Huan Zong seem so strange?)

00:20:39.008 --> 00:20:39.728
What?

00:20:39.889 --> 00:20:41.129
Would you like to watch?

00:20:44.849 --> 00:20:46.209
I don't mind it,

00:20:46.369 --> 00:20:47.849
but prolonged viewing

00:20:48.008 --> 00:20:49.649
might hinder your digestion.

00:20:49.649 --> 00:20:50.209
No.

00:20:50.209 --> 00:20:51.528
I won't disturb you.

00:21:09.728 --> 00:21:10.528
Speak.

00:21:10.969 --> 00:21:13.209
Why did my father send you here?

00:21:13.209 --> 00:21:15.129
What "father"?

00:21:15.209 --> 00:21:16.969
I've been explaining this
all the way here.

00:21:16.969 --> 00:21:18.488
I'm Kong Hou.

00:21:18.488 --> 00:21:20.369
I was just exhausted
from searching for you

00:21:20.369 --> 00:21:22.568
and slept in that tree for a while.

00:21:22.728 --> 00:21:23.728
I never expected

00:21:23.889 --> 00:21:24.728
I'd encounter you

00:21:24.728 --> 00:21:25.849
there.

00:21:25.849 --> 00:21:26.649
Besides,

00:21:26.808 --> 00:21:27.849
how did you become

00:21:27.849 --> 00:21:29.768
Lingyou Realm's Second Prince?

00:21:29.768 --> 00:21:31.488
What are you muttering about?

00:21:31.728 --> 00:21:33.328
I don't know you at all.

00:21:33.849 --> 00:21:35.528
I'm asking you one last time.

00:21:35.849 --> 00:21:37.209
Why did my father

00:21:37.209 --> 00:21:38.649
send you here?

00:21:38.649 --> 00:21:39.609
Huan Zong,

00:21:39.808 --> 00:21:41.449
I came for you.

00:21:41.449 --> 00:21:42.369
All of this

00:21:42.369 --> 00:21:43.728
is an illusion.

00:21:43.849 --> 00:21:45.088
Come with me, okay?

00:21:45.369 --> 00:21:46.889
Let's get out of here now.

00:21:47.169 --> 00:21:48.728
I'll say it again.

00:21:48.929 --> 00:21:50.528
I don't know you at all.

00:21:50.649 --> 00:21:51.929
You don't know me?

00:21:52.048 --> 00:21:53.849
How could you not know me?

00:21:53.849 --> 00:21:54.449
You...

00:21:55.649 --> 00:21:56.728
Earlier, you

00:21:56.849 --> 00:21:58.528
claimed to like me.

00:21:58.649 --> 00:22:00.169
But you don't know me now?

00:22:00.369 --> 00:22:01.449
Don't tell me you've fallen

00:22:01.488 --> 00:22:02.568
for Kong Hou?

00:22:02.808 --> 00:22:03.528
Yes.

00:22:05.649 --> 00:22:06.768
I've never met you.

00:22:07.088 --> 00:22:08.288
Let alone know you.

00:22:08.328 --> 00:22:10.609
And I'd never say such things.

00:22:13.248 --> 00:22:14.048
Previously,

00:22:14.449 --> 00:22:15.768
they told me

00:22:15.889 --> 00:22:18.048
after entering your inner demon realm,

00:22:18.328 --> 00:22:19.929
you'd forget me.

00:22:20.169 --> 00:22:21.409
I didn't believe them.

00:22:21.849 --> 00:22:22.808
Huan Zong,

00:22:23.369 --> 00:22:25.088
I'm Kong Hou of Yunhua Sect.

00:22:25.088 --> 00:22:26.649
You're Huan Zong of Liuguang Sect.

00:22:26.768 --> 00:22:27.728
Everything happened here

00:22:27.728 --> 00:22:28.768
is all fake.

00:22:28.768 --> 00:22:29.649
Just your inner demon.

00:22:29.649 --> 00:22:31.088
You have to wake up.

00:22:31.369 --> 00:22:32.969
I've heard of Yunhua Sect

00:22:32.969 --> 00:22:33.969
and Liuguang Sect.

00:22:33.969 --> 00:22:35.568
But what's that to me?

00:22:35.768 --> 00:22:36.568
You're currently

00:22:36.568 --> 00:22:38.088
Lingyou's Second Prince,

00:22:38.088 --> 00:22:38.849
but

00:22:38.969 --> 00:22:40.649
that's your former self.

00:22:40.768 --> 00:22:42.409
You joined Liuguang Sect later.

00:22:44.008 --> 00:22:44.889
Okay.

00:22:45.409 --> 00:22:46.288
Huan Zong,

00:22:46.568 --> 00:22:48.969
l-lower your sword first.

00:22:49.129 --> 00:22:51.328
Let's discuss in detail, okay?

00:22:56.369 --> 00:22:57.689
Huan Zong, I...

00:22:59.409 --> 00:23:00.889
Alright! Alright!

00:23:01.209 --> 00:23:02.528
I won't touch you.

00:23:02.808 --> 00:23:04.808
I just want to tell you the truth.

00:23:05.008 --> 00:23:06.209
Everything happened here

00:23:06.209 --> 00:23:07.689
is your inner demon.

00:23:07.889 --> 00:23:09.088
None of this is real.

00:23:09.088 --> 00:23:09.808
The real you

00:23:09.808 --> 00:23:11.768
lies unconscious in the outside world.

00:23:11.929 --> 00:23:13.008
If you doubt me,

00:23:13.008 --> 00:23:14.288
come with me now.

00:23:14.768 --> 00:23:15.849
Once we escape here,

00:23:16.048 --> 00:23:17.169
everything outside

00:23:17.288 --> 00:23:18.568
will make sense to you.

00:23:19.169 --> 00:23:20.088
Let go.

00:23:20.088 --> 00:23:21.728
Just come with me.

00:23:21.728 --> 00:23:22.528
Come with me.

00:23:22.528 --> 00:23:23.129
Why so strong?

00:23:23.129 --> 00:23:24.369
Come with me.

00:23:24.609 --> 00:23:25.969
Why bring me here?

00:23:26.169 --> 00:23:27.129
Can't you see

00:23:27.328 --> 00:23:28.369
the exit over there?

00:23:30.488 --> 00:23:31.689
What exit?

00:23:31.849 --> 00:23:32.849
Nonsense.

00:23:34.369 --> 00:23:35.169
Never mind.

00:23:35.328 --> 00:23:36.568
Your blindness matters not.

00:23:36.849 --> 00:23:38.008
Just follow me.

00:23:38.008 --> 00:23:38.808
Again?

00:23:39.449 --> 00:23:40.409
Are you even a woman?

00:23:40.409 --> 00:23:41.528
- Go!
- You're so strong.

00:23:41.528 --> 00:23:42.248
Let me go.

00:23:42.248 --> 00:23:43.568
Or I'll have you executed now.

00:23:44.088 --> 00:23:45.248
Once we escape,

00:23:45.248 --> 00:23:46.369
you'll just thank me.

00:23:46.369 --> 00:23:48.169
You'd never punish me then.

00:23:49.008 --> 00:23:49.849
Let go!

00:23:50.568 --> 00:23:51.929
Let go!

00:23:57.969 --> 00:23:58.649
Where is she?

00:24:01.929 --> 00:24:03.169
What's going on?

00:24:10.689 --> 00:24:11.528
It seems

00:24:11.528 --> 00:24:12.169
Huan Zong can't

00:24:12.169 --> 00:24:13.528
come out from this exit.

00:24:14.048 --> 00:24:15.088
Which means

00:24:15.248 --> 00:24:17.129
he can't conquer his inner demons.

00:24:26.488 --> 00:24:27.409
Huan Zong.

00:24:30.528 --> 00:24:31.328
Huan Zong.

00:24:31.929 --> 00:24:34.008
I beg you. Please wake up.

00:24:34.929 --> 00:24:35.929
I'm begging you.

00:24:38.768 --> 00:24:39.889
Don't speak.

00:24:40.768 --> 00:24:42.488
(He was injured
in the inner demon realm.)

00:24:42.609 --> 00:24:44.328
Why are there wounds
appearing outside too?

00:24:46.369 --> 00:24:47.568
So if you

00:24:47.728 --> 00:24:49.449
face danger inside,

00:24:49.649 --> 00:24:51.849
wouldn't your physical body also...

00:24:55.129 --> 00:24:57.088
It seems I can't act rashly yet.

00:25:00.849 --> 00:25:02.689
I must enter to find a way.

00:25:03.169 --> 00:25:04.849
I will definitely save you.

00:25:05.048 --> 00:25:06.288
I'll find a way.

00:25:06.449 --> 00:25:07.528
Wait for me here.

00:25:16.609 --> 00:25:17.528
It's strange.

00:25:18.609 --> 00:25:20.088
Why did she suddenly vanish?

00:25:20.288 --> 00:25:21.568
Am I seeing things?

00:25:21.568 --> 00:25:23.088
Or is this a dream?

00:25:27.649 --> 00:25:28.288
Your Highness.

00:25:28.288 --> 00:25:29.328
Don't speak yet.

00:25:30.409 --> 00:25:32.008
See what's behind me.

00:25:33.808 --> 00:25:34.649
A wall?

00:25:35.209 --> 00:25:36.209
Just a wall?

00:25:37.609 --> 00:25:39.129
Nothing unusual?

00:25:39.288 --> 00:25:41.369
Like an exit perhaps?

00:25:42.248 --> 00:25:43.328
An exit?

00:25:43.649 --> 00:25:44.728
There's no exit.

00:25:45.088 --> 00:25:45.889
Your Highness,

00:25:46.048 --> 00:25:47.008
what's wrong?

00:25:47.169 --> 00:25:48.288
No exit?

00:25:48.449 --> 00:25:49.689
Then what happened?

00:25:49.849 --> 00:25:51.728
How did she vanish then?

00:25:52.209 --> 00:25:53.048
Your Highness.

00:25:54.808 --> 00:25:55.889
Why are you here?

00:25:56.768 --> 00:25:58.169
We've caught Consort Qi's spy.

00:25:59.768 --> 00:26:01.129
Make it discreet.

00:26:01.129 --> 00:26:01.689
Understood.

00:26:05.649 --> 00:26:06.649
Let's go.

00:26:09.369 --> 00:26:11.369
Come here, my beauty.

00:26:12.449 --> 00:26:13.129
Come on.

00:26:13.328 --> 00:26:14.649
Have a grape.

00:26:20.689 --> 00:26:22.849
I truly never expected

00:26:23.008 --> 00:26:25.409
the Second Prince to be more eager

00:26:25.409 --> 00:26:26.609
than Your Majesty.

00:26:26.609 --> 00:26:27.528
He acted so recklessly

00:26:27.528 --> 00:26:29.008
in the imperial garden

00:26:29.169 --> 00:26:31.048
without fear of being seen.

00:26:32.328 --> 00:26:33.129
I think

00:26:33.129 --> 00:26:34.889
he wanted people to witness this.

00:26:36.929 --> 00:26:38.568
What do you imply?

00:26:38.568 --> 00:26:40.088
I don't understand.

00:26:42.169 --> 00:26:44.129
He was putting on a show for you.

00:26:44.209 --> 00:26:45.849
His schemes run deep.

00:26:46.328 --> 00:26:48.169
He's no ordinary playboy.

00:26:48.328 --> 00:26:50.369
He's probably harboring resentment.

00:26:51.528 --> 00:26:53.369
Your Majesty, you speak wisely.

00:26:53.528 --> 00:26:55.008
However,

00:26:55.169 --> 00:26:56.689
that palace maid today

00:26:56.889 --> 00:26:58.808
is quite lovely.

00:26:59.929 --> 00:27:00.609
Really?

00:27:00.609 --> 00:27:01.409
Tell me about it.

00:27:02.209 --> 00:27:04.288
Your Majesty!

00:27:05.409 --> 00:27:06.288
Come on.

00:27:06.288 --> 00:27:08.369
I'm just joking.

00:27:09.409 --> 00:27:10.568
You're the most lovely.

00:27:10.568 --> 00:27:12.008
You're the most lovely.

00:27:12.008 --> 00:27:13.328
That's more like it.

00:27:13.328 --> 00:27:14.609
I was thinking

00:27:14.609 --> 00:27:16.768
that maid's delicate appearance

00:27:16.929 --> 00:27:18.209
might prove useful for us

00:27:18.209 --> 00:27:19.568
in the future.

00:27:19.969 --> 00:27:23.129
After all, heroes fall to beauty's trap.

00:27:24.488 --> 00:27:26.488
Well said!

00:27:26.889 --> 00:27:27.889
I'll listen to you.

00:27:27.889 --> 00:27:29.728
I'll listen to you from now on.

00:27:32.568 --> 00:27:34.209
- Your Highness.
- I won't sleep!

00:27:34.209 --> 00:27:35.288
My brother hasn't

00:27:35.288 --> 00:27:36.528
told me a story yet.

00:27:36.689 --> 00:27:38.889
He still hasn't told me a story yet.

00:27:38.889 --> 00:27:40.488
You should retire.

00:27:40.488 --> 00:27:41.488
Your Highness.

00:27:41.488 --> 00:27:43.328
I won't sleep! I won't!

00:27:43.969 --> 00:27:45.129
What's going on?

00:27:45.568 --> 00:27:47.248
- Brother, you've finally come.
- Your Highness.

00:27:47.449 --> 00:27:48.728
Why do you come so late today?

00:27:48.728 --> 00:27:50.328
I've been waiting for so long.

00:27:50.568 --> 00:27:52.248
I had matters to attend.

00:27:54.048 --> 00:27:55.409
I was so scared.

00:27:55.649 --> 00:27:56.889
I thought

00:27:57.088 --> 00:27:58.768
you'd leave

00:27:58.768 --> 00:28:00.288
and never come back just like Mother

00:28:00.409 --> 00:28:02.008
and the First Prince.

00:28:02.008 --> 00:28:03.048
How could that be?

00:28:03.248 --> 00:28:04.528
Haven't I come now?

00:28:04.528 --> 00:28:05.449
Go. Time to sleep.

00:28:05.609 --> 00:28:06.369
You may leave.

00:28:06.728 --> 00:28:07.969
Let's go!

00:28:08.889 --> 00:28:09.969
Go on. Lie down.

00:28:11.248 --> 00:28:12.248
Brother,

00:28:12.449 --> 00:28:13.248
what story will you

00:28:13.248 --> 00:28:14.528
tell me today?

00:28:16.088 --> 00:28:17.849
No stories tonight.

00:28:18.008 --> 00:28:19.088
Instead, I'll share

00:28:19.088 --> 00:28:20.008
something personal.

00:28:20.169 --> 00:28:20.969
Great!

00:28:23.449 --> 00:28:25.528
Today, I passed by a place

00:28:25.889 --> 00:28:27.609
and saw a girl

00:28:27.808 --> 00:28:28.728
(fall down from a tree)

00:28:28.929 --> 00:28:30.209
(and I caught her.)

00:28:33.169 --> 00:28:34.568
From a tree?

00:28:37.129 --> 00:28:39.129
And she told me

00:28:40.528 --> 00:28:41.328
that we used to be

00:28:41.328 --> 00:28:42.849
very close friends,

00:28:43.689 --> 00:28:45.369
but I somehow forgot her.

00:28:47.288 --> 00:28:48.929
But I can't recall anything.

00:28:50.808 --> 00:28:51.929
Why?

00:28:52.169 --> 00:28:53.528
How could you forget

00:28:53.528 --> 00:28:54.689
a close friend?

00:28:55.129 --> 00:28:57.008
Was she very sad

00:28:57.169 --> 00:28:58.409
and angry?

00:28:59.728 --> 00:29:01.129
Maybe a little.

00:29:02.808 --> 00:29:04.088
Later,

00:29:04.088 --> 00:29:05.328
(she took me to a place,)

00:29:05.328 --> 00:29:06.768
(saying if I went with her,)

00:29:06.808 --> 00:29:07.808
(I'd recall everything.)

00:29:07.808 --> 00:29:08.808
Let go!

00:29:09.088 --> 00:29:09.849
Can't you see

00:29:09.849 --> 00:29:10.929
the exit over there?

00:29:13.369 --> 00:29:15.369
But there was clearly just a wall

00:29:15.768 --> 00:29:17.248
in that place.

00:29:17.609 --> 00:29:19.248
There was no exit at all.

00:29:19.728 --> 00:29:21.129
Oddly enough,

00:29:22.169 --> 00:29:23.929
she walked through the wall

00:29:24.288 --> 00:29:25.528
and vanished.

00:29:29.649 --> 00:29:30.808
Don't you find that strange?

00:29:31.129 --> 00:29:33.568
Brother, she must be

00:29:33.568 --> 00:29:34.649
a fairy,

00:29:34.649 --> 00:29:35.449
right?

00:29:36.449 --> 00:29:38.129
What "fairy"?

00:29:38.328 --> 00:29:39.488
Yes, she is.

00:29:39.808 --> 00:29:40.609
Otherwise,

00:29:40.609 --> 00:29:41.449
how could she

00:29:41.449 --> 00:29:42.768
get into a wall?

00:29:42.768 --> 00:29:43.609
Brother,

00:29:43.808 --> 00:29:45.248
if you meet her again,

00:29:45.248 --> 00:29:47.008
bring me to see her.

00:29:47.369 --> 00:29:48.609
I've never seen

00:29:48.609 --> 00:29:50.008
a fairy before.

00:29:52.328 --> 00:29:53.209
Alright.

00:29:53.649 --> 00:29:54.649
Go to sleep now.

00:29:57.209 --> 00:29:57.969
Lie properly.

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:04.544
(Zhaoqian Hall)

00:30:05.768 --> 00:30:07.169
How come it became daytime

00:30:07.369 --> 00:30:09.048
in the blink of an eye?

00:30:09.248 --> 00:30:10.488
We've waited days

00:30:10.488 --> 00:30:11.649
to finally catch you.

00:30:12.048 --> 00:30:13.369
Let's report back.

00:30:13.528 --> 00:30:15.209
What? It's been days?

00:30:15.209 --> 00:30:16.528
It's just the blink of an eye.

00:30:16.528 --> 00:30:17.088
What "days"?

00:30:17.088 --> 00:30:18.048
Move. Stop talking.

00:30:18.048 --> 00:30:18.609
Let me go.

00:30:18.609 --> 00:30:20.048
- Go!
- What are you doing?

00:30:20.488 --> 00:30:21.528
Let me go!

00:30:26.728 --> 00:30:28.409
Your Highness, she's here.

00:30:29.048 --> 00:30:30.169
Let her in.

00:30:30.449 --> 00:30:31.328
Huan Zong!

00:30:32.328 --> 00:30:34.369
I told you I could walk myself.

00:30:34.609 --> 00:30:35.248
Let go.

00:30:47.568 --> 00:30:48.369
Huan Zong,

00:30:48.568 --> 00:30:50.369
why are you acting like Jiao Tong,

00:30:50.488 --> 00:30:52.088
asking me to get in

00:30:52.129 --> 00:30:54.048
while still undressed?

00:30:54.288 --> 00:30:55.328
You may leave.

00:30:55.328 --> 00:30:56.369
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:31:08.768 --> 00:31:10.929
After careful consideration these days,

00:31:11.449 --> 00:31:12.728
I believe you're another spy

00:31:12.728 --> 00:31:13.849
sent by my father.

00:31:14.169 --> 00:31:15.889
You just can use some witchcraft.

00:31:16.609 --> 00:31:19.088
What? A spy?

00:31:19.248 --> 00:31:20.248
Witchcraft?

00:31:20.248 --> 00:31:21.129
Are you truly,

00:31:21.248 --> 00:31:22.129
as my brother claims,

00:31:22.129 --> 00:31:23.528
a fairy?

00:31:24.969 --> 00:31:25.768
Great.

00:31:25.768 --> 00:31:27.568
I'm a fairy this time.

00:31:29.409 --> 00:31:31.129
You'd better think carefully.

00:31:35.008 --> 00:31:37.008
I'm neither a spy

00:31:37.008 --> 00:31:38.768
nor a fairy.

00:31:38.768 --> 00:31:40.048
I'm Kong Hou.

00:31:40.048 --> 00:31:41.209
I'm your friend,

00:31:41.209 --> 00:31:42.409
Kong Hou.

00:31:43.169 --> 00:31:44.969
I'm not lying.

00:31:45.169 --> 00:31:46.129
It's just

00:31:46.488 --> 00:31:48.088
that you don't remember.

00:31:48.649 --> 00:31:50.048
So stubborn.

00:31:51.169 --> 00:31:52.048
In that case,

00:31:52.048 --> 00:31:53.048
I have no reason

00:31:53.048 --> 00:31:54.129
to hold back.

00:31:54.969 --> 00:31:55.889
Guards!

00:31:56.288 --> 00:31:58.328
Mark this woman as an assassin

00:31:58.488 --> 00:31:59.849
and execute her at once.

00:31:59.849 --> 00:32:01.008
Wait! Huan Zong,

00:32:01.008 --> 00:32:02.129
you can't do this to me.

00:32:02.129 --> 00:32:03.088
Y-You...

00:32:03.288 --> 00:32:03.889
Wait.

00:32:04.609 --> 00:32:05.728
I have a way

00:32:05.929 --> 00:32:08.248
to prove I'm your friend.

00:32:10.169 --> 00:32:11.088
What?

00:32:11.768 --> 00:32:13.288
I think I forgot something important.

00:32:13.288 --> 00:32:14.248
What's Huan Zong's

00:32:14.248 --> 00:32:14.889
inner demon?

00:32:14.889 --> 00:32:16.169
(Could his inner demon)

00:32:16.169 --> 00:32:17.288
(be Jiusu?)

00:32:17.609 --> 00:32:18.808
(Probably not.)

00:32:18.969 --> 00:32:20.088
Are you okay?

00:32:20.248 --> 00:32:20.969
If I know

00:32:20.969 --> 00:32:22.169
what his inner demon is,

00:32:22.169 --> 00:32:22.969
would I not say it?

00:32:22.969 --> 00:32:23.728
Serving him so long

00:32:23.728 --> 00:32:24.689
and still don't know?

00:32:24.689 --> 00:32:25.189
I...

00:32:26.008 --> 00:32:27.568
(When I first met him,)

00:32:27.568 --> 00:32:29.248
(he'd been at Liuguang Sect for long.)

00:32:29.248 --> 00:32:29.808
(He's always)

00:32:29.808 --> 00:32:30.969
(been like this.)

00:32:30.969 --> 00:32:31.689
(No one dares ask)

00:32:31.689 --> 00:32:32.849
(about previous things.)

00:32:33.008 --> 00:32:35.088
Well, Master Song He

00:32:35.088 --> 00:32:35.768
once said

00:32:35.768 --> 00:32:36.449
before joining

00:32:36.449 --> 00:32:37.889
Liuguang Sect,

00:32:37.889 --> 00:32:39.209
he went through terrible things.

00:32:39.808 --> 00:32:42.328
It looks like I'll have
to take it step by step

00:32:42.328 --> 00:32:43.929
after I enter.

00:32:43.929 --> 00:32:44.808
Oh, right, Kong Hou.

00:32:44.808 --> 00:32:45.369
Well...

00:32:45.969 --> 00:32:46.969
Move aside!

00:32:47.609 --> 00:32:48.568
Well, Kong Hou.

00:32:48.568 --> 00:32:49.328
Though I don't know

00:32:49.328 --> 00:32:51.008
Young Master's inner demon,

00:32:51.048 --> 00:32:52.528
I do know one of his secrets.

00:32:52.528 --> 00:32:53.889
When you go in,

00:32:53.889 --> 00:32:54.409
you...

00:32:54.409 --> 00:32:55.328
Move aside!

00:32:55.528 --> 00:32:56.488
If he doesn't know you

00:32:56.488 --> 00:32:57.248
after you go in,

00:32:57.288 --> 00:32:57.969
just tell him...

00:32:57.969 --> 00:32:58.568
You just...

00:32:58.728 --> 00:32:59.929
Come on. You just...

00:33:00.248 --> 00:33:01.609
You just tell him...

00:33:02.409 --> 00:33:03.409
I know

00:33:03.568 --> 00:33:05.288
there is a mole on your butt.

00:33:05.649 --> 00:33:06.609
Maybe let me

00:33:06.609 --> 00:33:07.929
come in and check for myself?

00:33:07.929 --> 00:33:08.929
Then we'll know!

00:33:10.409 --> 00:33:11.209
Bei Jun.

00:33:12.288 --> 00:33:13.209
You leave too.

00:33:13.488 --> 00:33:14.169
Yes.

00:33:19.969 --> 00:33:20.649
Huan Zong,

00:33:20.649 --> 00:33:22.129
now you believe me, right?

00:33:22.369 --> 00:33:23.528
What else do you know?

00:33:23.528 --> 00:33:24.409
Keep talking.

00:33:25.409 --> 00:33:26.449
I also know

00:33:26.449 --> 00:33:28.169
you love wearing white.

00:33:28.369 --> 00:33:29.248
That counts?

00:33:29.409 --> 00:33:31.169
You value cleanliness,

00:33:31.169 --> 00:33:31.889
so

00:33:31.889 --> 00:33:32.969
you forbid food

00:33:32.969 --> 00:33:34.169
in your chambers.

00:33:34.169 --> 00:33:35.169
Also,

00:33:35.449 --> 00:33:36.528
you've been particular

00:33:36.528 --> 00:33:38.209
when it comes to tea.

00:33:38.409 --> 00:33:39.849
You use morning dew

00:33:39.849 --> 00:33:42.129
from pine needles to brew your tea.

00:33:42.129 --> 00:33:44.169
No peach blossoms,

00:33:44.169 --> 00:33:45.129
snow plums,

00:33:45.129 --> 00:33:46.369
or lilies allowed.

00:33:46.768 --> 00:33:48.088
My father has really gone

00:33:48.088 --> 00:33:49.008
to great lengths

00:33:49.328 --> 00:33:51.129
just to get you close to me.

00:33:51.449 --> 00:33:52.689
He even told you

00:33:52.689 --> 00:33:54.528
such things in detail.

00:33:55.129 --> 00:33:57.008
He must value you greatly.

00:34:00.248 --> 00:34:02.728
Since my father values you so,

00:34:03.328 --> 00:34:04.248
I shouldn't

00:34:04.248 --> 00:34:05.488
kill you so easily.

00:34:05.689 --> 00:34:06.849
What logic is that?

00:34:06.849 --> 00:34:08.608
Why can't you kill me

00:34:08.608 --> 00:34:10.048
because he values me greatly?

00:34:10.048 --> 00:34:10.889
What?

00:34:11.128 --> 00:34:12.449
Do you want to be killed?

00:34:12.449 --> 00:34:13.729
Yearning for death?

00:34:14.208 --> 00:34:16.048
No! I don't!

00:34:16.128 --> 00:34:19.208
Well then. Just call me a spy.

00:34:26.769 --> 00:34:27.648
My lady,

00:34:27.849 --> 00:34:28.929
starting today,

00:34:28.929 --> 00:34:30.289
you'll be residing here.

00:34:31.289 --> 00:34:32.208
Here?

00:34:33.929 --> 00:34:35.329
(Didn't Huan Zong)

00:34:35.528 --> 00:34:37.088
(consider me a spy?)

00:34:37.088 --> 00:34:39.088
(Yet he arranged
such luxurious quarters for me?)

00:34:39.289 --> 00:34:40.608
(What's his real agenda?)

00:34:42.048 --> 00:34:42.809
My lady,

00:34:43.008 --> 00:34:44.688
all these are gifts

00:34:44.688 --> 00:34:46.249
from the Second Prince himself.

00:34:46.488 --> 00:34:47.969
Don't you know?

00:34:48.168 --> 00:34:49.648
Throughout these years,

00:34:49.648 --> 00:34:50.729
the Second Prince

00:34:50.729 --> 00:34:52.208
has never kept female company.

00:34:52.208 --> 00:34:53.849
You're the first one.

00:34:54.088 --> 00:34:55.409
If you manage

00:34:55.409 --> 00:34:57.249
to win his favor,

00:34:57.249 --> 00:34:58.369
a formal title

00:34:58.369 --> 00:34:59.889
might be in your future.

00:34:59.889 --> 00:35:01.688
When that day comes,

00:35:01.688 --> 00:35:03.289
do remember me please.

00:35:03.488 --> 00:35:04.289
Sir,

00:35:04.528 --> 00:35:05.769
you misunderstood.

00:35:05.769 --> 00:35:07.488
I-I don't need these.

00:35:07.488 --> 00:35:08.800
My relationship with Huan...

00:35:09.048 --> 00:35:10.648
with the Second Prince

00:35:10.889 --> 00:35:12.249
isn't what you imagine.

00:35:12.449 --> 00:35:14.329
Consort Qi heard the Second Prince

00:35:14.329 --> 00:35:15.249
found a beauty,

00:35:15.249 --> 00:35:16.449
and sends her blessings.

00:35:18.889 --> 00:35:19.648
This...

00:35:20.329 --> 00:35:22.488
What absurd nonsense!

00:35:25.969 --> 00:35:27.648
(Huan Zong is the Second Prince?)

00:35:27.849 --> 00:35:29.409
(So what the maids said)

00:35:29.409 --> 00:35:31.409
(about the Empress
being killed by her consort)

00:35:31.608 --> 00:35:33.488
(means his father murdered his mother?)

00:35:33.969 --> 00:35:35.688
(Also, the Emperor killed his brother,)

00:35:35.688 --> 00:35:36.969
(making him oversee execution?)

00:35:37.168 --> 00:35:38.008
(Oh, my.)

00:35:38.168 --> 00:35:39.608
(How monstrous!)

00:35:39.769 --> 00:35:41.289
(So could Huan Zong's inner demon)

00:35:41.488 --> 00:35:42.568
(stem from his failure)

00:35:42.568 --> 00:35:44.409
(to kill his father for vengeance?)

00:35:45.648 --> 00:35:47.208
(Then can I help him)

00:35:47.208 --> 00:35:48.369
(overcome his inner demon)

00:35:48.369 --> 00:35:49.329
(by helping him)

00:35:49.608 --> 00:35:51.088
(kill the Emperor?)

00:35:51.688 --> 00:35:53.889
(Or must he do it himself?)

00:35:59.128 --> 00:36:00.369
What's on your mind?

00:36:00.369 --> 00:36:01.409
You're so absorbed.

00:36:01.409 --> 00:36:02.088
Thinking of you.

00:36:02.088 --> 00:36:03.568
Huan Zong, why are you here?

00:36:05.528 --> 00:36:06.889
No wonder

00:36:06.889 --> 00:36:08.088
my father chose a rare gem.

00:36:08.088 --> 00:36:09.289
You're truly different.

00:36:09.449 --> 00:36:10.929
Even your words drip honey.

00:36:11.769 --> 00:36:12.369
No,

00:36:12.369 --> 00:36:13.568
that's not what I meant.

00:36:13.568 --> 00:36:14.409
You misunderstood.

00:36:14.929 --> 00:36:15.568
I...

00:36:18.208 --> 00:36:19.488
So what do you mean?

00:36:20.128 --> 00:36:21.488
Huan Zong, you...

00:36:23.729 --> 00:36:25.369
Y-You've been drinking?

00:36:25.929 --> 00:36:27.929
Let go of me, Huan Zong.

00:36:27.929 --> 00:36:28.488
No.

00:36:28.488 --> 00:36:30.168
Huan Zong, let me go.

00:36:30.168 --> 00:36:31.688
- Huan Zong.
- Didn't my father send you here

00:36:31.688 --> 00:36:33.449
for this?

00:36:33.449 --> 00:36:34.048
Huan Zong.

00:36:34.048 --> 00:36:34.969
- Go tell my father.
- Huan Zong.

00:36:34.969 --> 00:36:36.048
Don't do this.

00:36:36.048 --> 00:36:37.769
This is typical of the Second Prince,

00:36:37.809 --> 00:36:39.488
wallowing in debauchery

00:36:39.889 --> 00:36:41.208
and neglecting his duties.

00:36:41.208 --> 00:36:42.208
Let me go!

00:36:42.409 --> 00:36:43.249
Let go?

00:36:43.249 --> 00:36:45.008
Huan Zong, don't do this.

00:36:45.008 --> 00:36:45.809
Huan Zong.

00:36:46.008 --> 00:36:47.769
Huan Zong, let me go.

00:36:47.769 --> 00:36:48.688
Huan Zong.

00:36:48.969 --> 00:36:50.648
Huan Zong, don't.

00:36:50.648 --> 00:36:51.369
Huan Zong.

00:36:51.369 --> 00:36:52.168
Huan Zong.

00:36:52.168 --> 00:36:54.249
Snap out of it, Huan Zong!

00:36:55.088 --> 00:36:56.249
Huan Zong!

00:36:58.809 --> 00:36:59.889
Huan Zong!

00:37:02.969 --> 00:37:04.168
Huan Zong!

00:37:21.289 --> 00:37:23.409
(Huan Zong is now controlled
by his inner demons.)

00:37:25.008 --> 00:37:26.809
(This isn't his true nature.)

00:37:28.769 --> 00:37:29.769
Huan Zong.

00:37:32.528 --> 00:37:33.409
What happened

00:37:33.409 --> 00:37:35.128
to you today?

00:37:52.929 --> 00:37:53.889
Brother.

00:37:59.449 --> 00:38:01.608
Today is your birthday.
