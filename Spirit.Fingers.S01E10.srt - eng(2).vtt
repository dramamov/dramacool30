[Episode 10]
He said Gi Jeong is a giant creep.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.467
Kiddo, watch closely.

00:00:55.467 --> 00:00:57.233
This is the kind of guy I am.

00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:05.667
There he goes overacting again.

00:01:05.667 --> 00:01:06.767
Just get started already.

00:01:06.767 --> 00:01:09.133
Alright, alright. Let's draw quickly.

00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:10.733
Start.

00:01:23.067 --> 00:01:24.967
What?

00:01:27.433 --> 00:01:30.500
Can we do couple poses?

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.933
U Dol...

00:01:34.933 --> 00:01:36.433
Brother-in-law.

00:01:36.433 --> 00:01:38.800
Of course, absolutely.

00:01:42.967 --> 00:01:45.100
U Dol, what are you doing?

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.233
Just leave him be.

00:01:47.233 --> 00:01:49.067
Focus on drawing faster!

00:01:49.833 --> 00:01:52.433
This kid's impressive.

00:01:52.433 --> 00:01:55.000
Isn't Red even more impressive
for picking a fight with a kid?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.667
After giving birth to him,
my mom ate seaweed soup for weeks.

00:01:57.667 --> 00:01:59.867
Oh, Mother!

00:02:03.067 --> 00:02:05.067
Kiddo.

00:02:05.067 --> 00:02:06.833
Things won't go your way.

00:02:06.833 --> 00:02:07.933
Idiot.

00:02:07.933 --> 00:02:10.100
Five minutes is a long time.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.133
Just give up already.

00:02:29.133 --> 00:02:33.900
No way, I'll definitely make you mine.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.167
No, I'll make you my brother-in-law.

00:03:01.833 --> 00:03:03.600
Time's up. Five minutes are over.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.267
U Dol, get up quick.

00:03:06.167 --> 00:03:08.167
Hey, Gi Jeong.

00:03:08.167 --> 00:03:09.267
Are you okay?

00:03:09.267 --> 00:03:11.100
Yes, I'm fine.

00:03:11.933 --> 00:03:14.100
You're not fine.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.733
Are you okay?

00:03:16.867 --> 00:03:19.333
This is nothing for me.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.267
Right, kiddo?

00:03:25.667 --> 00:03:26.700
Yeah.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.067
I figured I could finally get a proper look here.

00:03:30.067 --> 00:03:32.833
They cropped out all the faces in the mall photos.

00:03:33.567 --> 00:03:36.433
If even a bit of his face shows, he goes crazy.

00:03:36.433 --> 00:03:39.867
It actually works better for me that way.

00:03:39.867 --> 00:03:41.567
Because his face isn't overexposed.

00:03:41.567 --> 00:03:44.233
Oh, I told you to drop that idea.

00:03:44.233 --> 00:03:47.800
He has absolutely zero interest in that world.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.600
You know CEO Kye from Star & Studio, right?

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.633
I do.

00:03:51.633 --> 00:03:54.033
The legendary photographer
who makes anyone famous.

00:03:54.033 --> 00:03:58.733
I begged him to take just one look
and finally got him here.

00:03:59.767 --> 00:04:01.367
But...

00:04:03.267 --> 00:04:04.667
You know J One? J One?

00:04:04.667 --> 00:04:06.067
Hey, stay still.

00:04:06.067 --> 00:04:07.067
The senior coming now

00:04:07.067 --> 00:04:11.467
worked with J One before fame
and made him a top star.

00:04:11.467 --> 00:04:13.367
You gotta impress him, okay?

00:04:13.367 --> 00:04:16.033
Ugh, I don't care about that.

00:04:16.033 --> 00:04:17.767
You said triple pay for today, right?

00:04:17.767 --> 00:04:19.000
Keep your word.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.567
Got it, man.

00:04:20.567 --> 00:04:22.367
Darn, you are ridiculously handsome.

00:04:25.667 --> 00:04:29.133
Senior, it's an honor to have you visit our place.

00:04:29.867 --> 00:04:31.700
Man, I'm busy.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:32.933
Is this the guy?

00:04:32.933 --> 00:04:33.933
Where's the camera?

00:04:33.933 --> 00:04:35.800
Ah, yes. Here it is.

00:04:37.067 --> 00:04:39.467
What's with your face?

00:04:39.467 --> 00:04:41.700
Why do you look so sour?

00:04:42.467 --> 00:04:44.100
How about a smile?

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.733
Don't wanna.

00:04:48.933 --> 00:04:51.000
What did you say?

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.967
If you want me to smile,

00:04:52.967 --> 00:04:55.300
try making me laugh first.

00:04:58.567 --> 00:05:01.233
Charming.

00:05:01.233 --> 00:05:03.400
Now I want more.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.733
Stop. Won't do it.

00:05:05.733 --> 00:05:08.300
I begged for three years.

00:05:09.267 --> 00:05:14.067
Thanks to this cute kid, today was fun.

00:05:14.067 --> 00:05:16.800
Shall we take a group photo?

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.167
- Sure.
- Okay.

00:05:18.167 --> 00:05:19.533
Let's go over there.

00:05:19.533 --> 00:05:21.733
U Dol, wanna take one with me?

00:05:21.733 --> 00:05:24.233
- Yeah.
- Pose like this...

00:05:24.233 --> 00:05:25.833
Ah, done.

00:05:27.667 --> 00:05:29.300
Sorry.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.233
Four, three, two.

00:05:39.533 --> 00:05:42.167
How was today? Did you have fun?

00:05:42.167 --> 00:05:44.933
Well... it was okay, I guess.

00:05:45.667 --> 00:05:47.300
It was fun, right?

00:05:48.833 --> 00:05:51.267
Will you keep seeing that giant creep?

00:05:51.267 --> 00:05:52.900
Huh?

00:05:53.967 --> 00:05:55.600
I said we broke up.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.133
U Dol, eat this.

00:05:57.133 --> 00:05:58.600
Think I'm stupid?

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.533
I saw you holding hands earlier.

00:06:00.533 --> 00:06:05.567
Five, four, three, two.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.000
I'll say it again.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.467
I hate that guy.

00:06:15.467 --> 00:06:17.767
U Dol.

00:06:17.767 --> 00:06:21.367
Even though the kid's still in grade school,
he's got this air that keeps you in check.

00:06:21.367 --> 00:06:25.300
No wonder Baeblu gets flustered around him.

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.300
Gi Jeong handled him pretty well though.

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.233
'Handled well'? My foot.
He's just as mentally immature.

00:06:30.233 --> 00:06:32.967
U Dol might actually be more mature.

00:06:32.967 --> 00:06:34.267
Jeez.

00:06:34.267 --> 00:06:37.100
Still, that kid was way too bold.

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.600
Even though he's a pathetic younger brother,

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.000
he nearly broke the precious spine
responsible for continuing the Nam family lineage.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.867
That's not it.

00:06:46.233 --> 00:06:48.800
I won't tell Mom.

00:06:49.467 --> 00:06:51.333
I don't get it at all,

00:06:51.333 --> 00:06:55.000
but maybe that guy has
some charm only you can see.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.633
Huh?

00:06:57.633 --> 00:06:59.667
He relaxed his body.

00:06:59.667 --> 00:07:03.667
Then suddenly, he lifted his hips a little.

00:07:04.933 --> 00:07:07.033
And he held himself up with his own strength.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.700
He's really thoughtful.

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:14.067
Must take after U Yeon.

00:07:14.067 --> 00:07:16.633
As expected, he's still
one step ahead of my brother.

00:07:16.633 --> 00:07:17.867
Really?

00:07:17.867 --> 00:07:19.000
He actually gave permission?

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.100
Yeah, I guess he learned something from it.

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.133
Good call bringing him along.

00:07:23.933 --> 00:07:26.333
You did great holding out earlier too.

00:07:26.333 --> 00:07:27.900
No.

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.200
U Dol was so light,

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.000
so it was like lifting a feather.

00:07:33.867 --> 00:07:37.000
Or maybe your waist is just super strong?

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.267
Of course my core strength is amazing.

00:07:39.267 --> 00:07:42.167
As expected, the man's back power is...

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:49.700
Hello?

00:07:51.533 --> 00:07:52.960
Hello?

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.600
Did we get disconnected?

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.300
Gi Jeong!

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.367
Huh?

00:08:00.367 --> 00:08:01.600
Yeah.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.533
What? I thought we got disconnected.

00:08:03.533 --> 00:08:05.633
Why'd you stop talking?

00:08:05.633 --> 00:08:07.667
Well.

00:08:07.667 --> 00:08:09.600
It sounded too suggestive.

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:12.067
Suggestive?

00:08:12.067 --> 00:08:15.333
Your... your comment about...

00:08:15.333 --> 00:08:18.800
What did I say that was inappropriate?

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:23.433
I only mentioned your waist being really strong.

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.696
Well, that...

00:08:25.696 --> 00:08:28.200
you know.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.467
How's that...

00:08:29.467 --> 00:08:30.900
I'm hanging up.

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:31.933
See you tomorrow.

00:08:31.933 --> 00:08:33.267
Gi Jeong? Gi Jeong.

00:08:33.267 --> 00:08:34.867
Wait.

00:08:35.667 --> 00:08:37.333
What? Why...

00:08:39.467 --> 00:08:41.400
But at our age,

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:44.433
should we really be discussing
PG-15 teenage romance?

00:08:44.433 --> 00:08:47.567
Let's talk about adult relationships,
adult relationships.

00:08:47.567 --> 00:08:50.533
Nothing? How about you guys?

00:08:50.533 --> 00:08:52.233
You're at the perfect age for it.

00:08:52.233 --> 00:08:54.133
Ugh, why are you asking us that?

00:08:54.133 --> 00:08:55.433
What about you, Black?

00:08:55.433 --> 00:08:57.467
Black's relationships aren't interesting.

00:08:57.467 --> 00:09:00.633
They're boring yet she never stops dating.

00:09:00.633 --> 00:09:02.500
What about her latest fling?

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.133
She already broke up.

00:09:06.533 --> 00:09:08.167
How do you know?

00:09:08.167 --> 00:09:12.500
Wait, are you two giving
each other dating advice now?

00:09:14.533 --> 00:09:15.533
Jonathan.

00:09:15.533 --> 00:09:16.533
Jonathan told me.

00:09:16.533 --> 00:09:18.600
How does Jonathan know?

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.833
Wait, are you two that close?

00:09:21.833 --> 00:09:24.167
No, it's not like that.

00:09:24.167 --> 00:09:28.600
The more you talk, the deeper
the hole you dig, time to stop.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:32.467
Long story short, he and Jonathan
found out. The end.

00:09:32.467 --> 00:09:34.833
Ugh, enough! What's important here?

00:09:34.833 --> 00:09:37.167
What matters is Black's relationship ended.

00:09:37.167 --> 00:09:39.767
Why aren't you dating anyone?

00:09:40.633 --> 00:09:42.233
Huh?

00:09:44.433 --> 00:09:46.167
Why aren't you two dating?

00:09:46.167 --> 00:09:48.967
I wonder that sometimes too.

00:09:48.967 --> 00:09:51.168
Do you really

00:09:51.168 --> 00:09:53.033
not have feelings for each other?

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000
What about Seon Ho?

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.433
Have you ever felt anything for Geu Rin?

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.800
I have.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.733
Sure have.

00:10:09.733 --> 00:10:12.033
Pretty often, actually.

00:10:12.033 --> 00:10:14.267
Oh my, what are you gonna do about that?

00:10:15.133 --> 00:10:16.767
What about you, Geu Rin?

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:20.000
Ever felt a spark with Seon Ho?

00:10:32.933 --> 00:10:34.600
He's annoying.

00:10:36.467 --> 00:10:37.500
Why are you following me?

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.433
You seemed upset earlier.

00:10:39.433 --> 00:10:42.067
You were awfully cheeky today.

00:10:42.067 --> 00:10:43.467
I've got something to ask.

00:10:43.467 --> 00:10:45.067
I don't wanna hear it.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.433
Ms. Taeng Ja!

00:10:59.833 --> 00:11:02.133
So Jonathan didn't tell you
why I broke up with that guy, huh?

00:11:02.133 --> 00:11:03.467
Because he called you Ms. Taeng Ja.

00:11:03.467 --> 00:11:05.533
You called me that even though you knew?

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.500
Taeng Ja.

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:12.533
What did you just call me...

00:11:12.533 --> 00:11:15.800
How can I make you see me as a man?

00:11:17.533 --> 00:11:21.633
Taeng Ja, what do I need to do
for you to see me as a man?

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:32.633
I!

00:11:32.633 --> 00:11:36.567
I told you not to call me Taeng Ja!

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.233
What about you, Geu Rin?

00:11:41.233 --> 00:11:43.800
Ever felt a spark with Seon Ho?

00:11:47.433 --> 00:11:49.133
I'm home.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.200
Why are you drinking alone?

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.133
Did you eat something wrong?

00:12:01.267 --> 00:12:04.500
I got the rod of love.

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:06.100
Is that soju?

00:12:20.333 --> 00:12:22.933
It's here! It's here! It's here!

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.600
Why do you like me?

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:35.367
Should I only say one reason?

00:12:35.367 --> 00:12:37.467
No, list them all out.

00:12:37.467 --> 00:12:39.467
It's your homework.
I'll check your answers in person.

00:12:39.467 --> 00:12:41.633
Yes!

00:12:41.633 --> 00:12:44.167
Oh my god!

00:12:46.467 --> 00:12:48.667
Hey, that's really naughty.

00:12:48.667 --> 00:12:50.733
So what's so naughty about it?

00:12:50.733 --> 00:12:52.400
Are you saying that talking about
strong waist strength is a naughty thing?

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:53.433
No.

00:12:53.433 --> 00:12:55.067
Jo Mi Rae, did you get heatstroke or something?

00:12:55.067 --> 00:12:56.500
You just said it was naughty.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:59.800
The one who felt the naughtiness
in that word is the naughty one.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.600
Ah, Nam Gi Jeong, Nam Gi Jeong.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.533
He's got that devil of lust deep in his heart!

00:13:05.533 --> 00:13:06.967
Speak in a way I can understand.

00:13:06.967 --> 00:13:08.000
In Earthling terms.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.533
Did you guys kiss?

00:13:09.533 --> 00:13:12.267
Not that peck from before, but a real kiss.

00:13:12.267 --> 00:13:14.133
What are you talking about? That never happened.

00:13:14.133 --> 00:13:15.167
Really?

00:13:15.167 --> 00:13:17.600
Okay, let me put it in Earthling terms for you.

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:20.000
Nam Gi Jeong will soon

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.933
pounce on you.

00:13:22.667 --> 00:13:24.167
You didn't stop reading smut, did you?

00:13:24.167 --> 00:13:25.500
Why would I stop?

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:27.333
You should go pray or something.

00:13:27.333 --> 00:13:30.167
The lust demon's all over you.

00:13:30.167 --> 00:13:31.833
Hey, catch U Yeon.

00:13:31.833 --> 00:13:35.133
He will pounce on U Yeon! Catch U Yeon.

00:13:36.533 --> 00:13:39.500
The kissing technique to win her heart.

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:42.233
Do I really have to teach this with my mouth?

00:13:42.233 --> 00:13:46.500
This is all the expertise I gained
through spending money and time.

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:51.833
Hey, Nam Gi Jeong.

00:13:51.833 --> 00:13:57.067
You can really act dense when you want to, huh?

00:13:57.067 --> 00:13:58.900
Please.

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:02.233
Please teach me.

00:14:02.233 --> 00:14:06.167
Don't just mindlessly charge in.

00:14:06.167 --> 00:14:08.200
Oh.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.767
The most important thing

00:14:10.767 --> 00:14:12.967
is her preference.

00:14:12.967 --> 00:14:14.600
Her preference?

[Ask Permission]
Can I?

00:14:19.392 --> 00:14:22.800
A girl who wants you to ask her
in a romantic way before kissing her.

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:23.900
Can I kiss you?

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:26.400
No.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.367
Ugh, why would you ask something like that?

00:14:29.367 --> 00:14:31.767
[Version 2: Pull Closer]
A girl who wants you to pull her in and kiss her.

00:14:31.767 --> 00:14:32.800
Don't do that.

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.867

[Version 4: Soulful Gaze]
A girl who wants you to gaze into her eyes

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:46.933
and naturally lean in for a kiss.

00:14:51.867 --> 00:14:53.504
But U Yeon

00:14:53.504 --> 00:14:56.000
wouldn't do any of these.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.800
Ugh, hopeless kid.

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:01.900
He's getting lessons just because he can't kiss?

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:04.367
I didn't expect Nam Gi Jeong's
love life to be like this.

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:07.433
Hey, what book did he ask us to buy for him?

00:15:07.433 --> 00:15:09.567
Can't remember even after hearing it 100 times.

00:15:09.567 --> 00:15:13.167
'A book about how to read books properly'!

00:15:15.467 --> 00:15:17.033
Wait,

00:15:17.033 --> 00:15:19.567
didn't he buy and read that last time?

00:15:19.567 --> 00:15:21.633
That was about reading books properly,

00:15:21.633 --> 00:15:27.700
but this one's about how to read books
about reading books.

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:29.667
What kind of nonsense is that?

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:33.033
It's not about being possessed by lust demons.

00:15:33.033 --> 00:15:35.100
I'm just chasing my dream.

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.267
Dreams?

00:15:36.267 --> 00:15:38.067
I've chosen my path.

00:15:38.067 --> 00:15:40.533
I'll become a romance novelist.

00:15:40.533 --> 00:15:41.967
What?

00:15:41.967 --> 00:15:44.967
You said not long ago that
you were going to become A&R.

00:15:44.967 --> 00:15:47.667
You said you wanted to create idols
like Legend with your own hands.

00:15:47.667 --> 00:15:50.933
No, I think I'm more talented in this field.

00:15:50.933 --> 00:15:55.300
And there's someone inspiring me these days too.

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:56.400
Other than Legend?

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:57.467
Yep.

00:15:57.467 --> 00:15:59.333

Hey, Oh Dae O.

What are you doing at a bookstore?

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000
It's so unlike you.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.067
Right back at you.

00:16:09.067 --> 00:16:12.600
Oh Dae O, I can't find it. Let's just go.

00:16:15.833 --> 00:16:18.867
- What's wrong?
- I didn't put on makeup today.

Did you come to buy a workbook?

00:16:28.933 --> 00:16:30.533
Yeah.

Oh, dear.

Why today of all days?

Wait, how did he know I was talking about him?

- Yes.
- Hi, Bigfoot.

You said you left a pencil case
and croquis book here?

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:26.100
I left them in the Baeblu room.

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:28.833
Sorry for the inconvenience.

00:17:28.833 --> 00:17:30.733
I've been distracted
because of my younger brother.

Oh, it's nothing.

By the way, Jonathan, I'm curious about something.

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.967
You're a rocker, right?

00:17:48.967 --> 00:17:50.000
Correct.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.400
Wow.

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.900
Were you originally aiming to be a rocker?

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:55.733
That's right.

00:17:58.333 --> 00:18:01.600
What's your dream, Baeblu?

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:04.800
I don't

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.267

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:10.500
There's nothing I'm exceptionally good at.

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.967
I don't know what to pursue.

00:18:12.967 --> 00:18:17.167
Then consider what you enjoy doing.

00:18:17.167 --> 00:18:19.700
Maybe that'll give you some direction.

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:22.167
I did think about that.

00:18:22.167 --> 00:18:26.533
But I don't even know what I like.

00:18:31.467 --> 00:18:33.167

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:37.633
Well, with a blank slate,
you can draw anything, right?

00:18:37.633 --> 00:18:39.233
Blank slate?

00:18:58.167 --> 00:19:00.267
Now that I think about it,

00:19:00.267 --> 00:19:02.733
there's something I do like.

00:19:04.967 --> 00:19:06.867
Does that mean Nam Gi Jeong becomes my dream?

00:19:06.867 --> 00:19:08.500
Me too.

00:19:11.933 --> 00:19:13.343
I didn't know

00:19:13.343 --> 00:19:16.167
you thought of me like that.

00:19:16.167 --> 00:19:18.500
No, that's not it...

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:19.967
What do you mean 'no'?

00:19:19.967 --> 00:19:21.900
I heard everything.

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:24.333
That's not what I meant.

What are you going to do?

00:19:29.267 --> 00:19:31.000
Take responsibility.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.333
For what?

00:19:32.333 --> 00:19:33.900
For you.

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:35.767
Yesterday, you shook me up
with suggestive comments.

00:19:35.767 --> 00:19:38.200
And now you're messing with my heart,
so what are you going to do about it?

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:01.067
Oh, come on.

00:20:02.467 --> 00:20:03.767
Stop that now.

There's also Option 4.

00:20:04.767 --> 00:20:06.867
Stop saying such stupid things, please.

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:12.700
No, absolutely not.

00:20:14.767 --> 00:20:17.200
I knew you'd say that.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:21.133
But someday, we will kiss.

00:20:21.133 --> 00:20:23.000
Of course, I want to do it right now, though.

I can't hear you.

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:29.900
If you really like someone,
kissing comes naturally.

I really like you too, but...

00:20:38.733 --> 00:20:42.067
Okay, you don't need to explain.

I already knew this is how you are.

But I wanted to see
if you have other sides to you.

00:20:49.633 --> 00:20:51.533
Other sides?

The me you know isn't all of me, right?

00:21:01.067 --> 00:21:02.533
So, I guess that means liking someone

00:21:02.533 --> 00:21:06.600
is about wanting to get to know
each other more and more.

00:21:07.933 --> 00:21:10.900
Oh, my head.

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:22.200
No, it's not.

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.967
Looks like Se Ra and Mi Rae
are staying late at the bookstore too.

00:21:25.733 --> 00:21:27.967
Oh, it's time to go.

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:33.100
Maybe I should start going to the study room too.

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:35.300
No.

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:37.700
Am I that embarrassing?

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:39.267
Oh, right!

00:21:39.267 --> 00:21:41.567
It was jealousy, right?

00:21:41.567 --> 00:21:43.933
It's not jealousy.

00:21:47.367 --> 00:21:49.500
U Yeon.

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:52.267
I really can't handle studying.

00:21:52.267 --> 00:21:56.167
But I'll never become someone who embarrasses you.

00:21:56.167 --> 00:22:00.100
I'll start seriously thinking about my future too.

00:22:00.933 --> 00:22:02.600
You said you'll become amazing?

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:05.633
Yeah, need to make it more specific.

00:22:05.633 --> 00:22:09.367
Okay, let me know
when you figure it out. I'm leaving.

00:22:09.367 --> 00:22:11.233
- Study hard.
- Yeah.

00:22:15.067 --> 00:22:16.667
Gi Jeong.

00:22:17.367 --> 00:22:19.567
Huh?

00:22:19.567 --> 00:22:21.300
Can I...

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:24.500
Can I go see you work?

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:25.533
Huh?

00:22:25.533 --> 00:22:28.133
I want to know more about you, is that okay?

00:22:28.133 --> 00:22:30.800
Sure! Sure! Totally fine!

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:33.500
I'll make sure to pick a day when I look my best.

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:35.267
Alright, see you later.

00:22:35.267 --> 00:22:37.833
Hey, be careful on your way.

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:54.767
Well, look who it is.

00:22:54.767 --> 00:22:56.400
Aren't you neglecting your work?

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:58.800
Sorry, I had lots to do yesterday.

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:01.500
It's fine. I only had one beer yesterday.

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:04.067
Managed to walk home
on two feet instead of crawling.

00:23:04.067 --> 00:23:06.067
Impressive.

00:23:06.067 --> 00:23:07.333
People keep saying I'm acting weird.

00:23:07.333 --> 00:23:08.800
Did I change too suddenly?

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:10.533
Do I look like I'm pretending?

00:23:10.533 --> 00:23:12.367
- Absolutely not.
- Right?

00:23:12.367 --> 00:23:13.900
Love changes people.

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:16.167
At the very least, I should avoid
worrying the person I like.

00:23:16.167 --> 00:23:17.900
You know that's how I approach
relationships, right?

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:19.600
Even before...

00:23:26.367 --> 00:23:30.333
Last time too, I went home early
because I didn't want you to worry.

00:23:32.667 --> 00:23:33.700
So responsible.

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:36.367
Of course. See you later.

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:40.100
Geu Rin.

00:23:40.967 --> 00:23:44.700
About Pink's question...

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:46.533
- Huh?
- What about you, Geu Rin?

00:23:46.533 --> 00:23:49.167
Ever felt a spark with Seon Ho?

00:23:53.067 --> 00:23:55.100
Go on, hurry.

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:12.033
Did you hear? Senior Heo Zero
is returning to school.

00:24:12.033 --> 00:24:14.667
I heard. School life might
actually become interesting now.

00:24:14.667 --> 00:24:17.100
He looks really cool when smoking.

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:19.133
Wow, I thought I was watching a photoshoot.

00:24:19.133 --> 00:24:22.300
Didn't he date that freshman
from the stage design department?

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:25.200
Ah, Nam Geu Rin? Probably broke up.

00:24:28.467 --> 00:24:29.767
- What?
- Really?

00:24:29.767 --> 00:24:32.467
So that's why Eun Gi was crying his eyes out?

00:24:34.133 --> 00:24:35.133
He cried?

00:24:35.133 --> 00:24:37.333
Bawled his eyes out.

00:24:37.333 --> 00:24:39.333
Hey, that's harsh.

00:24:39.333 --> 00:24:41.312
You've ignored his words for three years,

00:24:41.312 --> 00:24:43.900
but said yes to some girl you just met?

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:45.567
Hey, you're here.

00:24:45.567 --> 00:24:48.867
Nam Gi Jeong, nice to meet you.

00:24:48.867 --> 00:24:52.480
Ah, this is Manager Noh Ji Won
from SN Entertainment.

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:54.696
My junior from school.

00:24:56.333 --> 00:25:00.633
I'm sure you're tired of hearing
compliments about your looks.

00:25:00.633 --> 00:25:03.500
[Manager Noh Ji Won, SN Entertainment]
How should I persuade you...

00:25:08.067 --> 00:25:09.433
Why did you change your mind?

00:25:09.433 --> 00:25:13.300
You said you hated the attention and being busy.

00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:14.933
Exactly.

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:18.567
Well...

00:25:18.567 --> 00:25:21.367
I'm happy with how things are,

00:25:21.367 --> 00:25:24.267
but if I can become better,

00:25:24.267 --> 00:25:26.833
I should try.

00:25:29.533 --> 00:25:31.833
He said he wants to get to know you better?

00:25:31.833 --> 00:25:32.900
Huh?

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:34.067
Yeah, why?

00:25:34.067 --> 00:25:37.400
That's a totally suggestive thing to say.

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.433
Why is that a suggestive thing to say?

00:25:39.433 --> 00:25:41.133
The male lead in the novel I read yesterday

00:25:41.133 --> 00:25:43.967
said that exact line before doing 'that' with her.

00:25:43.967 --> 00:25:46.400
But you said that?

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.767
Oh man, why did you do that?

00:25:48.767 --> 00:25:50.000
Doing 'that'?

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.367
Mi Rae, get a grip.

00:25:53.367 --> 00:25:56.167
And please read clean fic instead of smut.

00:25:56.167 --> 00:25:58.233
You shouldn't have access
to adult content. How'd you get it?

00:25:58.233 --> 00:25:59.467
It's a secret.

00:25:59.467 --> 00:26:02.133
Anyway, true love is R-rated apparently.

00:26:02.133 --> 00:26:05.200
So, you're going to visit
where your boyfriend works?

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.800
Yeah, I've never seen Gi Jeong working before,

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:10.100
so I thought he might be upset.

00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:15.200
Also, I thought there might be
sides of Gi Jeong I don't know.

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:18.167
Oh, already checking for cheating?

00:26:18.167 --> 00:26:20.300
No, that's not it...

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:23.367
Gi Jeong's here.

00:26:23.367 --> 00:26:26.133
He said he's late for work,
just came to see me quickly.

00:26:26.133 --> 00:26:27.667
Fix Jo Mi Rae.

00:26:27.667 --> 00:26:29.000
See you at the study room.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.733
Not sure if she can be fixed.

00:26:31.733 --> 00:26:33.633
Let's go.

00:26:33.633 --> 00:26:35.167
Oh, right.

00:26:35.167 --> 00:26:37.333
I had somewhere to go.
I need to get my act together.

00:26:37.333 --> 00:26:39.267
Suddenly?

00:26:39.267 --> 00:26:40.733
Yeah, I'll stop by there with you, I guess.

00:26:40.733 --> 00:26:42.000
No, it's fine.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.167
I'll go alone.

00:26:43.167 --> 00:26:46.367
You're the top student. You should study.

00:26:46.367 --> 00:26:48.000
See you later.

00:26:57.733 --> 00:26:59.867
So handsome.

00:27:06.633 --> 00:27:09.133
Even candid shots of my boyfriend
look like magazine spreads.

00:27:09.133 --> 00:27:11.400
He's so handsome.

00:27:22.067 --> 00:27:23.700
Gi Jeong.

00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:26.833
U Yeon. Hey, don't run, you'll fall.

00:27:26.833 --> 00:27:28.467
Huh?

00:27:33.833 --> 00:27:35.744
Why are you here so fast?

00:27:35.744 --> 00:27:38.033
Just wanted to see you sooner.

00:27:40.033 --> 00:27:42.033
We're such a pair of fools, right?

00:27:42.033 --> 00:27:43.067
No.

00:27:43.067 --> 00:27:44.800
I'll be the only fool here. Just me.

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:47.500
You can't be a fool, it'll ruin your studies.

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:49.233
Your dream is to get into college, right?

00:27:49.233 --> 00:27:51.433
Oh, wait.

00:27:51.433 --> 00:27:52.933
Did you say I'm your dream?

00:27:52.933 --> 00:27:54.467
No, I didn't.

00:27:54.467 --> 00:27:56.600
Let's go together, Miss Piggy.

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:07.767
I'm home.

00:28:07.767 --> 00:28:09.533
Song U Yeon, stop!

00:28:09.533 --> 00:28:11.633
Hey, take this trash out first.

00:28:12.567 --> 00:28:14.267
Why? Hurry up.

00:28:14.267 --> 00:28:17.033
Mom, why do I always get these chores?

00:28:17.033 --> 00:28:19.500
Anyone could do this, it's not just you.

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:20.600
- Hurry up.
- Fine.

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:23.667
Anyone can take out trash, why always me?

00:28:23.667 --> 00:28:25.000
What's up with you again?

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.267
You apologized last time,
and now pulled this again.

00:28:27.267 --> 00:28:29.000
It wasn't a one-sided apology.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.133
I apologized for disrespecting you.

00:28:31.133 --> 00:28:33.800
I thought you would apologize too if I went first.

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:37.667
Why would I apologize to you?

00:28:37.667 --> 00:28:40.300
You always argue back at the end of everything.

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:42.767
Why are you acting like this?

00:28:42.767 --> 00:28:43.900
You weren't like this before!

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:46.600
Because I used to be a coward!

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:48.800
I did what you said, even if I didn't like it,
because I was afraid you'd hate me.

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:50.633
Now I'm not scared anymore!

00:28:50.633 --> 00:28:52.267
I don't care if you hate me.

00:28:52.267 --> 00:28:54.367
I hate it when you play favorites!

00:28:55.467 --> 00:28:57.067
What?

00:28:58.633 --> 00:29:01.133
Ugh, fine. I'll do it myself.

00:29:01.133 --> 00:29:02.667
It's either you or me. Who else would do it?

00:29:02.667 --> 00:29:04.800
I wouldn't ask if I weren't busy.

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:07.500
I'll take it out.

00:29:10.167 --> 00:29:12.300
U Seok.

00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:14.533
No, U Seok. Don't get your hands dirty.

00:29:14.533 --> 00:29:16.433
Let go. I'll take care of it.

00:29:16.433 --> 00:29:18.467
I was going to get some fresh air.

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:25.367
Feeling relieved now?

00:29:25.367 --> 00:29:28.800
Does it feel good making your brother
do it after two months?

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:32.333
I can't take this anymore.

00:29:46.667 --> 00:29:49.967
[Gi Jeong: Did you get home safe?]

00:29:49.967 --> 00:29:54.200
[Sorry I couldn't walk you home because of work.]

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:57.333
[Almost died worrying.]

00:29:57.333 --> 00:29:59.100
[Almost died.]

00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:03.033
[Almost died.]

00:30:03.033 --> 00:30:05.267
How many times will you type that?

00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:11.700
[Don't worry, got home perfectly fine.]

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:16.433
[Glad to hear. Thanks.]

00:30:16.433 --> 00:30:18.067
[What's there to thank?]

00:30:18.067 --> 00:30:22.400
[Just grateful you are here.]

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:26.333
[Here we go again. Stop saying that.]

00:30:26.333 --> 00:30:29.067
[Talk later. Eun Gi's calling me.]

00:30:29.067 --> 00:30:30.112
[Okay, work hard.]

00:30:36.633 --> 00:30:39.833
Gi Jeong, you know what?

00:30:39.833 --> 00:30:41.900
Sometimes,

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:45.800
I used to find comfort in dark rooms.

00:30:47.267 --> 00:30:50.637
I don't have to see the blurry floor

00:30:50.637 --> 00:30:52.533
because of tears.

00:30:56.167 --> 00:30:58.367
But these days, it's different.

00:30:59.167 --> 00:31:02.833
Whenever the floor starts to get blurry,

00:31:02.833 --> 00:31:06.867
someone mysteriously appears to wipe my tears.

00:31:06.867 --> 00:31:08.367
You see,

00:31:08.367 --> 00:31:10.467
I'll become an amazing man.

00:31:10.467 --> 00:31:12.433
No need to stress about it now.

00:31:12.433 --> 00:31:16.067
I just feel destined for greatness, you know?

00:31:16.067 --> 00:31:19.300
Such reckless confidence

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:22.000
strangely calmed me down.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.933
Is it some kind of spell?

00:31:25.433 --> 00:31:27.053
Whatever it is,

00:31:27.053 --> 00:31:29.433
I'll always believe you.

00:31:30.733 --> 00:31:32.768
And I

00:31:32.768 --> 00:31:35.133
keep liking you more.

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:45.433
But

00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:50.432
sometimes

00:31:50.432 --> 00:31:52.900
you feel too good to be true.

00:31:56.067 --> 00:31:57.667
I just like you.

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:02.667
I'm behind you.

00:32:02.667 --> 00:32:04.333
You're special to me.

00:32:04.333 --> 00:32:07.233
You are super duper extra special to me.

00:32:08.033 --> 00:32:10.208
You

00:32:10.208 --> 00:32:11.867
should like me back.

00:32:11.867 --> 00:32:14.300
To someone like me,

00:32:15.367 --> 00:32:18.400
you're something that could never happen.

00:32:21.067 --> 00:32:22.700
So sometimes,

00:32:23.433 --> 00:32:28.433
I can't help but feel afraid,

00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:32.600
that one day,

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:35.767
I'll wake up and you'll be gone.

00:32:59.867 --> 00:33:01.333
Ugh, kill me now.

00:33:01.333 --> 00:33:04.300
Here I go again.

00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:06.100
But Koo Seon Ho,

00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:09.200
I'm not ready to answer you yet.

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:10.367
I'm truly sorry.

00:33:10.367 --> 00:33:11.400
Why?

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:13.967
It's because it's not easy for me.

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:17.267
Seon Ho.

00:33:21.567 --> 00:33:23.167
You've started

00:33:23.167 --> 00:33:25.133
avoiding me again, huh?

00:33:26.933 --> 00:33:28.100
Avoiding you? What are you talking about?

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:31.067
Hey, did I do something wrong to you?

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:37.400
Why are you like this?

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:39.333
Is it the first time I've avoided you?

00:33:39.333 --> 00:33:41.100
This is the second time.

00:33:41.733 --> 00:33:43.667
The first time was when I confessed,

00:33:43.667 --> 00:33:45.167
and the second time is

00:33:45.167 --> 00:33:47.433
after what happened last time.

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.633
Have you really never felt

00:33:52.033 --> 00:33:53.833
your heart flutter for me?

00:34:06.333 --> 00:34:08.963
Is your 'Acaprio'

00:34:08.963 --> 00:34:10.867
still blonde?

00:34:10.867 --> 00:34:12.567
No.

00:34:13.333 --> 00:34:15.000
Got it!

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.267
What's the big deal?

00:34:16.267 --> 00:34:17.300
Never felt a flutter?

00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:19.500
Hey... Who is this?

00:34:20.333 --> 00:34:22.400
I missed you.

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:24.000
Rin Rin.

00:34:31.867 --> 00:34:33.667
I'm back.

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:37.750
Koo Seon Ho,

00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:39.533
how have you been?

00:34:39.533 --> 00:34:42.433
You two are still close, huh?

00:34:44.267 --> 00:34:46.267
Take your hands off her, senior.

00:34:46.267 --> 00:34:47.633
Huh?

00:34:47.633 --> 00:34:49.400
Your hands.

00:34:50.333 --> 00:34:51.967
Hands?

00:34:54.667 --> 00:34:56.700
Rin Rin!

00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:58.333
Rin Rin!

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:11.933
Does it have to be like this?

00:35:11.933 --> 00:35:15.433
Nam Gi Jeong would call U Yeon
beautiful even if she looked homeless.

00:35:15.433 --> 00:35:18.500
That's Nam Gi Jeong. The real problem
is the people around him.

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:21.400
- Group model shoot today, right?
- Yeah.

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:23.767
They might even compare you to them.

00:35:23.767 --> 00:35:25.800
You need at least a little protection.

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:27.200
I'm not sure if that's right.

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:29.000
Ah, the lens.

00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:33.100
You prepared the mystic teal color I requested?

00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:34.333
No.

00:35:34.333 --> 00:35:35.767
Can't be helped.

00:35:35.767 --> 00:35:39.133
This is my favorite dress. Be careful wearing it.

00:35:40.512 --> 00:35:42.433
Thanks.

00:35:42.433 --> 00:35:44.867
Okay, don't forget the live chat update.

00:35:44.867 --> 00:35:46.633
Yeah, see you at the study room later.

00:35:46.633 --> 00:35:48.267
Okay.

00:35:51.833 --> 00:35:54.933
Should we catch a movie after so long?

00:35:54.933 --> 00:35:56.600
You came with Song this morning, huh?

00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:59.300
Ah, she slept over at my place.

00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:01.433
I think she had something
going on with her mom again.

00:36:01.433 --> 00:36:04.567
Song always runs to you
when that happens, doesn't she?

00:36:04.567 --> 00:36:06.267
- Huh?
- Well...

00:36:06.267 --> 00:36:08.467
I'm not exactly the most helpful friend.

00:36:08.467 --> 00:36:10.533
That's not true.

00:36:10.533 --> 00:36:14.533
Song felt bad that I've been
sleeping alone these days.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.433
Let's watch movies another time.

00:36:18.433 --> 00:36:20.500
I have loads of homework.

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:22.100
Let's go.

00:36:30.533 --> 00:36:31.967
Wait.

00:36:31.967 --> 00:36:33.667
This wasn't the original plan, right?

00:36:33.667 --> 00:36:34.800
It's my decision.

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.133
You did whatever you wanted too, right?

00:36:36.133 --> 00:36:37.167
No, seriously.

00:36:37.167 --> 00:36:38.800
This isn't okay.

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:41.233
Can you iron and hang that properly?

00:36:41.233 --> 00:36:43.400
I didn't even tell you to wear it,
but why are you freaking out?

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:45.367
Fine, then I'll wear it too.

00:36:45.367 --> 00:36:46.967
No need. You have your own outfit.

00:36:46.967 --> 00:36:49.133
No, I don't want that.
Then I'll wear the same thing.

00:36:49.133 --> 00:36:51.000
I don't want that too. This is my studio.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.000
Are you the boss here?

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.267
I'll do as I please, okay? Stop it.

00:36:54.267 --> 00:36:56.167
Come on. Just hear me out once.

00:36:56.167 --> 00:36:58.433
Why is Gi Jeong acting like that?

00:36:58.433 --> 00:37:02.000
Group shoot today.
He called Miss Piggy accordingly.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.600
And?

00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:05.800
The outfits changed.

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:09.167
- Gi Jeong's clothes?
- No, the models'.

00:37:09.167 --> 00:37:10.800
How?

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:20.500
I think it's here?

00:37:30.433 --> 00:37:32.033
She's a model?

00:37:33.267 --> 00:37:35.933
Mi Rae was right.

00:37:35.933 --> 00:37:38.267
It makes me feel intimidated.

00:37:40.933 --> 00:37:42.300
No.

00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:45.433
I'm me and she's her.

00:37:46.233 --> 00:37:49.233
If Gi Jeong saw this, he would lecture me again.

00:37:54.068 --> 00:37:55.667
Yo.

00:37:55.667 --> 00:37:57.800
Hello.

00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:00.867
U Yeon! Why are you here already?

00:38:00.867 --> 00:38:03.500
Go, go. Come back later.

00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:05.467
You told me to come straight after school.

00:38:05.467 --> 00:38:06.967
Anyway, you can't be here now.

00:38:06.967 --> 00:38:08.000
- Should we call in the model?
- Do it.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.667
- Let's go.
- Gi Jeong. Shoot's starting.

00:38:10.667 --> 00:38:13.400
Models, please come out.

00:38:15.767 --> 00:38:17.033
Hey, darn it!

00:38:17.033 --> 00:38:19.000
U Yeon, stop watching.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.667
Just look at me.

00:38:26.333 --> 00:38:28.400
Are you okay?

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:30.567
Even your hiccups are cute.

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:33.133
Ah, nice.

00:38:33.133 --> 00:38:35.100
Keep the wild energy till the end.

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:36.533
Push through to the finish.

00:38:36.533 --> 00:38:37.967
Tension, tension!

00:38:37.967 --> 00:38:40.833
Three, two.

00:38:40.833 --> 00:38:41.900
- Great.
- U Yeon.

00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:43.933
Sit here.

00:38:43.933 --> 00:38:45.533
Don't look there.

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:47.467
Don't turn around

00:38:47.467 --> 00:38:49.167
until I come out.

00:38:49.167 --> 00:38:50.667
This place is full of wolves,

00:38:50.667 --> 00:38:53.167
and pretty girls like you are in danger.

00:38:53.167 --> 00:38:56.500
Stay like that, okay.

00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:58.200
It came out great.

00:38:58.200 --> 00:38:59.733
Can you hold their pants for a second?

00:38:59.733 --> 00:39:01.367
- Dae O.
- Yeah?

00:39:01.367 --> 00:39:03.333
Tell that traitor to get ready.

00:39:03.333 --> 00:39:04.967
Say he's up next.

00:39:04.967 --> 00:39:06.367
Hey, you heard him, right?

00:39:06.367 --> 00:39:09.167
Okay, please go.

00:39:09.167 --> 00:39:11.333
Ah, this is making me anxious, seriously.

00:39:12.367 --> 00:39:14.500
Come quickly.

00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:18.067
Why'd you dress up so nicely again today?

00:39:20.033 --> 00:39:21.333
- Don't look back, got it?
- Okay, okay.

00:39:21.333 --> 00:39:22.933
Please wait a moment.

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:28.367
My friend's embarrassing. I'll apologize for him.

00:39:29.333 --> 00:39:30.933
Me too.

00:39:31.667 --> 00:39:34.100
This situation is...

00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:36.467
Like 'comrades in misery'?

00:39:37.833 --> 00:39:40.967
'Shared suffering.'

00:39:40.967 --> 00:39:42.233
Okay!

00:39:42.233 --> 00:39:43.433
Ah, nice.

00:39:43.433 --> 00:39:44.467
Cut.

00:39:44.467 --> 00:39:46.633
Now prepare for the next outfit.

00:39:46.633 --> 00:39:48.233
Tell Gi Jeong to come.

00:39:48.233 --> 00:39:49.833
Gi Jeong!

00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:55.633
Why am I so nervous?

00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:22.200
You got this.

00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:24.600
Keep your eyes on me.

00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:27.100
Okay, strike a pose.

00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:28.367
Cue.

00:40:28.367 --> 00:40:29.833
Set the mood.

00:40:29.833 --> 00:40:31.433
Good.

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:38.033
I've never seen him so serious before.

00:40:38.033 --> 00:40:40.500
Different from how he is at SF.

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:42.700
Right, turn slightly.

00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:44.367
Half-step back, okay.

00:40:44.367 --> 00:40:46.333
Perfect.

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:58.333
Even just dressing him up
brings out something in him.

00:41:01.433 --> 00:41:04.600
Let's keep going.

00:41:06.033 --> 00:41:08.367
Great, good.

00:41:08.367 --> 00:41:09.533
Excellent.

00:41:09.533 --> 00:41:12.400
Like you're looking at something comfortably.

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:19.033
♫ You make me understand ♫

00:41:19.033 --> 00:41:25.100
♫ You make me find myself ♫

00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:29.233
♫ 'Cause you're a star ♫

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.033
♫ 'Cause you're a star ♫

00:41:44.367 --> 00:41:45.933
Crazy...

00:41:45.933 --> 00:41:48.867
I actually fell for that act back then.

00:41:58.133 --> 00:41:59.767
Rin Rin.

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:06.167
It's hot. Let's talk inside.

00:42:06.167 --> 00:42:08.000
Want me to break your arm?

00:42:10.433 --> 00:42:12.128
You are

00:42:12.128 --> 00:42:14.067
really mad at me.

00:42:14.067 --> 00:42:16.300
I've been reflecting hard.

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:18.033
Leaving like that.

00:42:19.067 --> 00:42:20.067
Cut me some slack.

00:42:20.067 --> 00:42:21.467
To be precise,

00:42:21.467 --> 00:42:24.800
you didn't leave, but I dumped you.

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:25.800
Did you?

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:28.533
Right. We're nothing now.

00:42:28.533 --> 00:42:31.600
Stop acting like this.

00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:33.867
I came back because of you.

00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:39.867
I thought about you a lot.

00:42:39.867 --> 00:42:41.933
You're the only one I could think of.

00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:47.167
Your acting's improved. I admit it.

00:42:47.167 --> 00:42:49.767
But your act doesn't work on me anymore.

00:42:49.767 --> 00:42:51.733
So get lost.

00:42:51.733 --> 00:42:53.664
Since when

00:42:53.664 --> 00:42:56.500
did you and Seon Ho become so close?

00:42:57.233 --> 00:43:00.400
Were you lonely without me?

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:02.733
See you around, Rin Rin.

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:28.367
Why wait outside? You should've stayed in.

00:43:28.367 --> 00:43:30.267
Huh?

00:43:30.267 --> 00:43:32.967
Ah, it's too crowded inside.

00:43:32.967 --> 00:43:35.167
It was a bit crowded today.

00:43:35.167 --> 00:43:36.433
How was it?

00:43:36.433 --> 00:43:38.533
I was the only one you had eyes for, right?

00:43:38.533 --> 00:43:40.267
Yeah.

00:43:40.267 --> 00:43:42.967
Let's go. I'll buy you something tasty.

00:43:42.967 --> 00:43:44.867
Wait.

00:43:44.867 --> 00:43:46.656
I think

00:43:46.656 --> 00:43:49.133
I need to head home early today.

00:43:49.133 --> 00:43:50.967
What?

00:43:50.967 --> 00:43:52.800
You never mentioned that.

00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:57.000
I forgot about tomorrow's pop quiz. Sorry.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.633
Oh, really?

00:44:01.433 --> 00:44:03.000
Can't be helped, I guess.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.100
I'll walk you home.

00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:05.700
No.

00:44:07.167 --> 00:44:10.200
I have to meet my mom.

00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:11.900
Huh?

00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:15.267
She wants to visit the department store.

00:44:15.267 --> 00:44:16.867
Your mom?

00:44:18.533 --> 00:44:20.433
I should get going.

00:44:20.433 --> 00:44:21.967
Thanks for inviting me today.

00:44:21.967 --> 00:44:23.567
I'll text you.

00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:34.667
What's this? Weren't you
all excited to go out on your date?

00:44:34.667 --> 00:44:37.500
She says she forgot she has a pop quiz tomorrow.

00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:39.033
What? A pop quiz?

00:44:39.033 --> 00:44:40.267
Do they still do those nowadays?

00:44:40.267 --> 00:44:42.533
Guess her school still does.

00:44:42.533 --> 00:44:44.533
But why did you let her leave alone?

00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:49.567
She had plans with her mom.

00:44:49.567 --> 00:44:50.867
'Is she a kid?'

00:44:50.867 --> 00:44:52.767
'What's with the pop quiz?'

00:44:52.767 --> 00:44:54.400
[Is she a kid? What's with the pop quiz?]

00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:57.833
Jo Mi Ryo said this.

00:45:19.033 --> 00:45:20.733
Welcome.

00:45:25.033 --> 00:45:28.900
You could've taken your time with the homework.

00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:30.133
I finished it all.

00:45:30.133 --> 00:45:31.733
Really?

00:45:32.933 --> 00:45:34.567
Sit down.

00:45:43.467 --> 00:45:46.067
Tell me.

00:45:46.067 --> 00:45:48.100
The reason I like you...

00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:49.833
I was just drawn to you.

00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:52.767
I thought there'd be some grand reason.

00:45:52.767 --> 00:45:54.733
Because you're bold and honest.

00:45:54.733 --> 00:45:57.467
With anyone, anywhere.

00:45:57.467 --> 00:46:01.267
I like how you don't worry about others
and stay focused on yourself.

00:46:01.267 --> 00:46:02.767
Yeah?

00:46:02.767 --> 00:46:05.467
What if I'm different outside SF?

00:46:05.467 --> 00:46:07.633
- Huh?
- Would you still feel the same?

00:46:07.633 --> 00:46:10.700
What if I were a timid mess
who can't even make eye contact?

00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:15.167
What if I'm someone who always
blames myself for everything?

00:46:15.167 --> 00:46:16.233
That's impossible.

00:46:16.233 --> 00:46:18.233
Right, it couldn't be.

00:46:18.233 --> 00:46:21.267
But I'm also not the woman you imagine.

00:46:21.267 --> 00:46:24.500
Meaning, I'm a fantasy you built.

00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:26.633
A version of me that only exists inside SF.

00:46:26.633 --> 00:46:28.667
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

00:46:32.133 --> 00:46:33.767
Hyuk.

00:46:37.667 --> 00:46:39.700
If the me you like is your fantasy,

00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:43.533
then don't try to get it through
someone else, make it yours.

00:46:43.533 --> 00:46:47.000
If I pretend to fall
for your flirting here just for fun,

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.933
I become a witch seducing an innocent boy.

00:46:51.567 --> 00:46:54.533
I'm not that irresponsible with my life.

00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:00.400
What's with that look?

00:47:01.167 --> 00:47:05.100
If that look means you understood
nothing and like me even more,

00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:06.867
I'll kill you.

00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:22.500
Where are you?

00:47:31.533 --> 00:47:32.600
You have class.

00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:34.767
- I'll skip it. Let's hang out.
- Are you a kid?

00:47:34.767 --> 00:47:36.067
Why?

00:47:36.067 --> 00:47:38.333
Let's get something tasty, okay?

00:47:38.333 --> 00:47:40.267
Ah, tasty food!

00:47:40.267 --> 00:47:41.867
Let's go!

00:47:52.667 --> 00:47:53.667
Not eating?

00:47:53.667 --> 00:47:55.533
Then I will.

00:47:55.533 --> 00:47:58.433
Ah, that's petty.

00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:05.467
I'm stressed.

00:48:05.467 --> 00:48:07.633
Heo Zero.

00:48:07.633 --> 00:48:08.767
Oh, jeez.

00:48:08.767 --> 00:48:13.067
I was finally forgetting everything,
and then he shows up and messes me up again.

00:48:13.067 --> 00:48:14.733
Messes you up?

00:48:15.967 --> 00:48:17.000
Huh?

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.100
Did he stir your feelings?

00:48:20.352 --> 00:48:22.167
No, that's not what I meant.

00:48:26.133 --> 00:48:27.533
Why the sigh?

00:48:27.533 --> 00:48:29.833
It doesn't bother you, right?

00:48:29.833 --> 00:48:30.900
It does.

00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:32.167
Seon Ho.

00:48:32.167 --> 00:48:35.567
Is it normal to not care
when my girlfriend's ex keeps hovering?

00:48:35.567 --> 00:48:37.200
Koo Seon Ho.

00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:41.367
This is driving me crazy.

00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:47.333
Wait a second.

00:48:47.333 --> 00:48:48.967
Koo Seon Ho.

00:48:50.367 --> 00:48:53.133
Why care about Heo Zero?

00:48:53.133 --> 00:48:55.633
You think I'd waver because of him?

00:48:55.633 --> 00:48:57.033
That's insulting.

00:48:57.033 --> 00:48:58.233
Nam Geu Rin.

00:48:58.233 --> 00:49:01.267
Which one did you just tell that you're stressed

00:49:01.267 --> 00:49:03.600
because your ex keeps bothering you?

00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:05.467
Male friend Koo Seon Ho? Or...

00:49:05.467 --> 00:49:07.400
Boyfriend Koo Seon Ho?

00:49:08.867 --> 00:49:12.800
Are you dating me, or are you playing pretend?

00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:15.367
Think seriously again.

00:49:58.333 --> 00:50:00.633
Gi Jeong was shining.

00:50:01.667 --> 00:50:05.500
Brighter than anyone else there.

00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:10.667
He didn't even have to try,

00:50:10.667 --> 00:50:13.400
but it came naturally to him.

00:50:15.733 --> 00:50:19.200
People who effortlessly have it all.

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:22.000
Born with everything from the start.

00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:25.533
And me, who believed every word

00:50:25.533 --> 00:50:28.733
those people said.

00:50:32.067 --> 00:50:35.600
All the things Gi Jeong told me.

00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:37.967
Words sweeter

00:50:37.967 --> 00:50:40.767
than 'I like you.'

00:50:46.033 --> 00:50:48.767
Words that reassured me

00:50:50.533 --> 00:50:52.133
are now

00:50:52.833 --> 00:50:55.733
turning into lies that come back

00:50:55.733 --> 00:50:57.433
to hurt me.

00:51:00.033 --> 00:51:02.500
When you fall for someone,

00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:05.433
you end up discovering yourself,

00:51:05.433 --> 00:51:07.300
not them.

00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:11.900
Hidden parts of my heart.

00:51:13.167 --> 00:51:15.072
The raw truth

00:51:15.072 --> 00:51:17.067
about me.

00:51:26.333 --> 00:51:28.167
What should I do, Gi Jeong?

00:51:28.167 --> 00:51:29.800
I'm...

00:51:30.533 --> 00:51:34.033
I'm starting to hate you.

00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:57.067
Delulu

00:51:57.967 --> 00:51:59.633
has returned.

00:52:05.433 --> 00:52:07.200
Am I that embarrassing to you?

00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:09.833
I wish you'd stop acting so confidently.

00:52:09.833 --> 00:52:12.067
If you hate it, I'll quit. It's not a big deal.

00:52:12.067 --> 00:52:14.233
If you betray our Song, I'll skin you alive...

00:52:14.233 --> 00:52:16.233
I've got my own problems right now.

00:52:16.233 --> 00:52:19.000
Those two walked in like Moses
parting the Red Sea.

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:22.567
All of this is because of Acaprio.

00:52:22.567 --> 00:52:24.467
Then we should crush that punk.

00:52:24.467 --> 00:52:26.100
You acted all high and mighty in front of me,

00:52:26.100 --> 00:52:27.600
and this is all you're capable of, lying?

00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:28.633
Don't you hate my mom?

00:52:28.633 --> 00:52:30.933
All parents are like that.
They're just worried about you.

00:52:30.933 --> 00:52:33.600
I don't hate your mom, but she scares me.

00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:36.800
I'm thinking of breaking up with Gi Jeong.

00:52:40.767 --> 00:52:42.000
So tell me.

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:45.367
Tae Seon, you're the one among us
who thinks the most.

00:52:45.367 --> 00:52:49.033
Hey, does thinking always hurt this much?

00:52:50.464 --> 00:52:51.488
Darn it!

00:52:51.488 --> 00:52:53.333
These darn thoughts!

00:52:53.333 --> 00:52:55.700
How do I get them out of my head?

00:52:55.700 --> 00:52:58.033
Then stop thinking!

00:52:59.098 --> 00:53:00.767
Darn it.

00:53:00.767 --> 00:53:03.967
I can't. They keep coming!

00:53:03.967 --> 00:53:05.300
You little punk!

00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:07.167
Since when did you become such a deep thinker?

00:53:07.167 --> 00:53:09.800
You're barely Homo erectus,
trying to act like Homo sapiens.

00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:12.233
That's why your head's exploding!
