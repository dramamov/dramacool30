(Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism and KOCCA)

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:06.240
(This is a work of fiction. All names, characters,)

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:07.410
(and incidents are products of the author's imagination.)

(All child actors were accompanied by a guardian,)

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.680
(and filmed in accordance with labour laws.)

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.750
All right, here's the question.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.050
During a nuclear explosion or powerful lightning...

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.060
that can stop phones, microwaves, and even a spaceship in flight,

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.190
what's this EM shockwave called?

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.900
Looks like Yeon San was quickest on the buzzer again.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.500
(Joo Yeon San, Ban Ji No)

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.300
Hey Ji No, please tone it down. This is an educational program.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.570
Joo Yeon San. If you get this right, you will win the title.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.080
That's ten-year-old Joo Yeon San.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.310
This is the first moment in her life she wishes she could delete.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.320
The reason she went on a quiz show she wasn't even interested in...

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:48.890
was her homeroom teacher.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.990
In his first semester after joining, he was really well put together.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.120
Joo Yeon San?

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:54.860
How do you feel?

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.160
Feeling confident?

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.100
Yes.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.100
(Let's go, Yeon San!)

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.340
That's our confident Joo Yeon San. Go ahead and tell us your answer.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.140
My answer is EMP, the electromagnetic pulse.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.240
Correct!

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.340
(Let's go, Yeon San!)

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.940
This year's champion of the Science Genius Quiz is...

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.980
Cheongnyong Elementary's 3rd-grader, Joo Yeon San!

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.350
(Joo Yeon San, Ban Ji No)

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.450
(Joo Yeon San)

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:22.920
Yes, Joo Yeon San.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.260
Any thoughts on your victory?

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.430
- I did get the answer right, but... - But?

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.800
Technically speaking, a spaceship in flight wouldn't stop.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.230
As you explained, an EMP is an electromagnetic shockwave.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.600
So the spacecraft's computer systems would shut down,

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.400
and the communication systems may fail.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.110
Also, the control systems might malfunction,

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.880
but the spaceship wouldn't come to a physical stop.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.840
My, Joo Yeon San, you're quite sharp.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.080
We were just trying to simplify it for our younger audience...

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.080
But if it's for elementary students, shouldn't it be more accurate?

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.150
This is a science quiz show, after all.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.730
During a nuclear explosion or a powerful lightning...

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.430
As you can see, Joo Yeon San could be a bit much back then.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.740
But her teacher was a rare adult who looked upon San with pride.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.300
Natural selection.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.010
Rounded to 233.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:15.940
First law of thermodynamics!

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.710
The number 2 appears p minus 2 times!

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.150
That's right! This year's champion of the Science Genius Quiz is...

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.150
Cheongnyong Elementary's 3rd-grader, Joo Yeon San!

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.650
(Scholarship Certificate)

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.250
Joo Yeon San!

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.160
The quiz show brought her attention, fame, and even prize money.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.470
She felt on top of the world, posing for a photo with her teacher.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.770
So why does San remember it as such an embarrassing part of her past?

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.340
She says even she didn't know at the time...

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.680
that it would be the beginning of a disaster.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.320
A poet trying to start a business? Give me a break.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.120
Come on, who knew selling workbooks would be so risky?

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.120
(Yeon San is the trend.)

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.120
San's father even quit his job.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.260
Swayed by his acquaintances, jumped into the workbook business.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.190
The business, of course, failed.

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:10.960
San's family ended up in a motel.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.070
Maybe it was her environment,

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.770
but San had a sexual awakening young.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:20.940
A short stay?

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.640
- She soon learned what it meant... - Hey,

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.910
- for couples to check into a motel. - what should order to eat?

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.580
How's about something hot?

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.910
Something hotter than last night?

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.750
And that this was the worst place to run into her teacher.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.320
San?

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:36.960
Vice...

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:39.820
Principal?

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.860
They apparently spent...

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.500
their room time just trying to keep San quiet.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.800
Should she have been happy that they left and did nothing?

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.500
And bittersweetly, this was San's first love.

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.670
In middle school, Joo Yeon San was a surprisingly pious churchgoer.

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.140
It wasn't so much a belief in a deity,

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.710
but more her sheer desperation.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.510
At San's request, because she had terrible acne then,

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.480
this scene was recreated using AI.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.480
We appreciate your understanding.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.520
It's also to protect this boy's privacy.

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.720
Is that the new Nonghyup branch manager's son?

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.390
Yes. He has such a sophisticated air.

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.260
With that branch manager's help,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.300
San's parents took over a motel up for auction...

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.140
by taking out every loan they could.

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.110
And so, San went from living in a motel to the owner's daughter.

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.280
But it's not as if San liked him for his family's status.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.420
She said the manager's son had beautifully slender fingers.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.060
His side profile was to die for,

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.260
and he looked so beautiful even with his eyes closed...

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.930
Wait, what is this?

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.730
Wait, no, seriously!

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.440
During their performance together, disaster struck.

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.540
Their fingers had only brushed against each other.

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.450
"What the heck? Get your hands off me!"

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.420
Screaming that during the service was, admittedly, San's fault.

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.150
They gossiped about how she'd called a perfectly normal guy a pervert.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.690
They said the motel warped her views,

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.920
ending her second love like that.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.290
(Korea Science High School)

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.800
At 17, San escaped the motel.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.600
She wasn't called the "Quiz King" for nothing.

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.800
She entered the notorious Science High School easily.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.370
But she faced prodigies...

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.040
who'd studied abroad and mastered calculus.

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.680
And apparently, competing with them wasn't easy.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.950
And so, her grades continued to fall.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.080
How can we make a team...

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.020
by making a compound from the remaining element symbols?

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.550
Let's kill it!

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.590
- Are we ready? - She reluctantly participated...

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.690
in the KAIST Mentoring Camp.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.290
And there, among all those light-emitting diodes,

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.370
- is where she met Chang Yi. - Five, four,

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.110
three, two, one!

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.280
Team Acetylene and Team Ozone, you both are the winners!

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:23.250
Although he was her age, he was already a KAIST freshman.

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:30.700
Joo Yeon San.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:34.500
I'm Park Chang Yi.

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:37.340
From earlier... Team Acetylene.

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:41.910
- Yes. - That was...

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:43.570
a lot of fun, wasn't it?

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:46.710
Yes.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.450
- Can I get your phone? - Sorry?

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:02.190
This is my phone number.

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:05.760
Text me when the camp's over.

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:07.130
Let's hang out.

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.080
We'll save the rest of the details for another time.

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:25.680
However, the key thing to note here...

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.620
is Joo Yeon San's repeating pattern.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.790
Whenever she got involved with a guy who was way too into himself,

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.060
the outcome was never good.

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:39.160
(I wish to withdraw from school.)

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.430
Based on the data she'd collected over many years,

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:43.470
San had even reached...

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:44.940
- that very conclusion. - It was me...

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:56.950
So why do I find myself with this handsome guy again?

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.240
(LOVE.exe)

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.880
(Episode 7: A Banana Instead of School Lunch)

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:45.460
You okay?

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.570
Is it normal for my heart to be racing like this?

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.040
It must be I haven't run in a while.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.110
Sorry. Did I startle you?

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.380
But why on earth are you carrying that thing?

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:01.310
(Smooth Taste, Like Dew)

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:02.310
Oh, this.

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:06.450
This person here, you know...

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:08.720
She's the one who came to our school to film that time.

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:10.350
She's super famous.

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:11.620
You know her, right?

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:15.730
I'm a huge fan of her. I really like her.

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:19.960
But it was on the ground by a bar, so I was trying to stand it back up.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.830
For a styrofoam cutout?

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:25.240
I know, but still,

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.140
if something that looks human is rolling around on the ground,

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:30.510
it's not a good look, you know?

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.110
But some guys were being real jerks...

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:33.780
What the... Why is that over there?

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:35.850
with this.

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:41.520
They kept messing with it, and I couldn't just stand by.

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:45.020
It's hot.

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.360
What?

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:53.830
(Smooth Taste, Like Dew)

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.500
Now that he's covered it, why does it feel more familiar?

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.170
Coming through.

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:02.170
Yes, go ahead.

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.040
Now I remember.

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:12.120
Why do I keep acquiring unwanted data?

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:14.250
Sorry?

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:16.090
What did you say?

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:18.820
No, I just...

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:21.530
think I get the picture.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.730
Anyway, I should be heading home.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:25.760
Turns out my place is this way.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.030
Oh.

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:29.600
Oh, hold on!

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:31.400
I...

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:34.140
I have a favour to ask you.

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:36.340
Can I...

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:39.910
just crash at your place for the night?

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:53.720
I have to go back to the shoot,

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:56.560
and it's a pain to lug all this stuff there.

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:04.040
(Smooth Taste, Like Dew)

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:07.040
(No.1 Soju, made with spring water)

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.820
What am I doing?

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:26.120
You were supposed to be filming. Where did you go?

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:28.930
Oh...

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:31.060
I just...

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.660
felt so suffocated.

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.370
- What? - Hey...

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:39.240
There's no such thing as an eco-friendly golf course.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:44.540
Even tiny hotels produce a ton of waste.

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:46.940
How is this possible?

00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:51.720
I thought I was helping the planet, so I promoted it so hard, you know?

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:54.920
Min Hak, this is no time to be worrying about that stuff.

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:57.020
I have to worry about that stuff.

00:11:57.090 --> 00:11:58.720
I'm the ambassador.

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.660
- Look at this first. - What is it?

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:06.360
You remember the Yongsan premiere the day you and Jinny...

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.400
had that episode?

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:08.630
Yes.

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:12.070
After the main after-party, it seems a small group had another round.

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:13.970
That's when this photo was taken at some market food stall.

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:16.870
That's Timothy.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.380
I'm a huge fan of his.

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:20.910
It hasn't hit the media yet,

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:23.180
but after last year's Busan International Film Festival,

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:25.820
there have been rumours circulating that Jinny and Timothy are an item.

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:29.450
And Jinny's agency has no intention of stopping this rumour at all.

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:30.890
Busan.

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:32.890
Do you mean last year's Busan?

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:35.360
Yes! That was when she was seeing you.

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:39.600
Hey, what the heck is this?

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.000
While we were busy with the Quiz King,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.640
she was starting a rumour with Timothy?

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:47.810
What, so Timothy is on a level to have a dating rumour with Jinny,

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:49.640
but you're not?

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:52.080
Don’t you ever join these stupid contests again.

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:54.180
You're just doing someone else's work.

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:58.280
Jinny has been ghosting you lately, right?

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:00.480
But, Timothy?

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:02.090
This is unbelievable.

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:07.220
It felt warmer this time last year. Why is it so cold?

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:08.960
I'm a little cold, too.

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:10.690
Right? It's this weird weather.

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:12.700
It snowed on the first day of class.

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:16.300
- Or we could grab a drink inside? - What?

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.070
We could get a room.

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.670
A room?

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:22.240
We can grab some soju and snacks and go.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:27.410
There's a good izakaya nearby. Can't we just go there?

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:32.250
I'd rather we relaxed, just the two of us.

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:37.590
I don't think we're at that stage yet.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:39.520
Stage?

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:44.430
We've only chatted online. This is our first time meeting.

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:47.030
Can't we just grab a highball at the izakaya tonight?

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:49.400
Okay.

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:50.700
Come on, let's go.

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:55.540
Playing hard to get when she's not even hot...

00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:58.580
What?

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:01.380
What?

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:03.680
You just said something.

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:06.020
Just that it's getting chilly.

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:08.950
Something about playing hard to get. You didn't say that?

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:13.820
Fine, I did. I said it.

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:15.990
"Playing hard to get when she's not even hot."

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:17.260
It's not like I'm wrong.

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:19.900
So this is why you acted all gentlemanly.

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:23.730
Hey, we'll never see each other again.

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:25.170
If I knew you were all talk,

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.640
I wouldn't have paid for a single drink.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.440
Act precious, then.

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:30.770
But you won't have to worry. Guys won't even look at you.

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:45.760
Hey.

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:48.430
What's this?

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:52.130
Wonder if you taste good?

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.370
What do you think he'll taste like?

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:56.700
I think I need a little sample.

00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:59.300
Man, but that face...

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:00.940
Oh, never mind.

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:02.240
Can't be a picky eater.

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:05.580
Gil Tan.

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:11.920
Let's go over there and warm up.

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:13.850
I'll get you all nice and hot.

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:15.790
What? Wait?

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:17.760
Hey, where are you going?

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:20.120
You said it was cold. I'll warm you up!

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:21.490
- I'm going home! - Stop!

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:24.700
That one looks so delicious!

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:26.600
(Founders' Hall)

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:27.670
Hello, everyone.

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:30.700
- Lunchtime... - So that jerk asked me to a motel.

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:32.940
Motel at first meeting? Is he nuts?

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:34.000
I know, right?

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:37.270
I was so scared of that psycho,

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:39.040
but a passing neighbour helped me.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.040
A neighbour?

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.950
A neighbour and also a colleague, I guess?

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:43.380
Don't tell me it was the Tissue Man?

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:46.220
You two keep bumping into each other.

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:49.050
Today's menu...

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:50.050
(Lunch menu)

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:51.620
Why is everything over ten dollars?

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:53.760
Seriously, I can never get used to these prices.

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:55.660
Seriously, we should start a petition.

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:57.460
Isn't this basically embezzlement?

00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:58.900
I wouldn't mind if it were any good.

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:00.260
The bird flu ended ages ago,

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:01.730
and they still won’t give fried egg refills?

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.340
Just a banana again today?

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:10.710
"Better to start with a doable plan now than wait for a perfect one."

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:12.840
Is this about not getting the scholarship?

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:15.050
When you have an unexpected expense,

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:17.310
cutting back on eating out is the surest way to save.

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.120
Sure.

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:25.060
Will one banana really be enough for you?

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:26.990
Not me. I could never.

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:28.530
Gosh.

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:31.600
Hey, it's been a while since I had cafeteria food.

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:34.100
What's on the menu today?

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:36.130
He is the one, the Tissue Man.

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:37.530
The guy with the dyed yellow hair.

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:39.000
His body is insane.

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:42.210
I thought you liked softer features.

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:44.910
When did I say he was my type?

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:46.710
I'm grateful, so he's on my mind.

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:48.050
My mom always said not to owe anyone anything.

00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:49.980
- Hey Gil Tan! - Hey, Min Hak!

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:52.550
- Hey, everyone, say hi. - Hello.

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:54.120
- This is our superstar, Min Hak. - Hello.

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.620
So he's friends with Min Hak too. He's such a social butterfly.

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:57.790
I see that.

00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:00.560
I thought Min Hak had no friends in the Department of Modelling.

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:04.260
- There's nothing to eat today. - Oh?

00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:11.240
- Hey, come by later. - Okay.

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:20.710
(Endless Sparkle, Ultimate Refresh)

00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:21.710
Jinny?

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:24.620
What, so Timothy is on a level to have a dating rumour with Jinny,

00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:26.180
but you're not?

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:31.290
(Endless Sparkle, Ultimate Refresh)

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:34.560
He must really like Jinny.

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:44.940
A banana in a pouch?

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:49.610
She doesn't even waste a half-eaten banana.

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:52.310
San practices what she preaches,

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:56.050
unlike me and Jinny.

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.320
Wait!

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:02.820
Na Rae.

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:06.720
Hey, your legs are really long.

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:09.190
Sorry. I didn't know you were following me.

00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:10.360
It's fine.

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:13.760
I need to talk to you privately.

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:16.270
What about?

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:20.570
Who was it again? Paeng Gil Tan?

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:22.040
Are you close with him?

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:24.640
Yes.

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:27.180
So, does he have a girlfriend?

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:28.810
Or someone he's talking to?

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:32.050
Not that I'm interested, of course.

00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:33.850
But in case he's interested in me,

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:37.120
then I have to be responsible for my actions.

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:42.060
Is he seeing someone?

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:43.590
- No. - So he's solo!

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:47.660
No, I'm just saying I don't really know.

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:50.000
You don't know? I thought you two were close.

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:52.370
Should I ask him?

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.740
- What he thinks of you? - Oh no.

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:56.010
There's no need for that at all.

00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:58.010
Aren't you curious?

00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:00.380
No, it's just...

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:04.450
Times like these are...

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:06.320
when you really need that Love Alarm.

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:10.620
If we had something like that, we'd avoid any misunderstandings.

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:12.120
Right?

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:15.290
I'm going to go try convince San again.

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:18.400
Anyway, thanks, Min Hak. Get home safe.

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:19.560
Bye.

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:29.870
Hey, man.

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:33.140
Right.

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:35.880
And about that meeting today...

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.250
If I'm not absolutely needed...

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:41.890
So, to continue what I was saying,

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:43.920
the Love Alarm,

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:46.160
I'm saying, why can't we make it?

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:48.260
Because I'm kind of desperate.

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:49.460
I'm not a fan.

00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:53.360
Setting aside whether we could find a suitable dataset,

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:55.530
the motivation for a gamble that's beyond our abilities...

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.830
is just to help your hopeless love life?

00:19:58.640 --> 00:19:59.970
I have zero motivation.

00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:01.940
Actually...

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:03.240
What?

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:06.940
I'm not sure how much data you'd actually need,

00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:09.680
but I feel like you wouldn't need a lot of data to tell...

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:11.520
when someone has a crush.

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:15.890
But to meaningfully quantify that kind of subjective judgment,

00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:18.090
you need tons and tons of inductive evidence.

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:19.190
What I'm saying is,

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:21.890
you can't hide your feelings.

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:24.060
Without realising, your eyes are drawn to them,

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:25.500
you hover around,

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:27.200
you keep trying to talk to them.

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:29.570
Your face gets all red, your heart starts pounding...

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:32.700
and you even dream of them, right?

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:34.240
I guess that's true.

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:39.410
But dreaming about someone doesn't necessarily mean you like them.

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:44.280
Instead of that, if we're to make something that reads people's minds,

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:48.190
I'd rather it tell me when a breakup is about to happen.

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:53.320
When the person I like starts to drift away from me,

00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:56.230
an alarm or something would go off.

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:58.060
It'd give you a chance to save it.

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:01.030
Or at least give you time to accept it.

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:05.470
It could probably even tell if your partner is cheating.

00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:11.740
But I still need a Love Alarm more.

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:14.440
I could totally use it on my dad.

00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:17.480
I need to go protest against the merger.

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:20.150
- Just go straight. Go straight. - Straight.

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:21.890
- What? - Go straight.

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:22.950
What's that now?

00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:25.620
- How's that? - A little...

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:30.260
- Just a little this way. - This way?

00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:35.300
But that idea just now is not actually realistic, is it?

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:36.900
It's not completely out of the question.

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:41.170
What if an app predicted breakups by measuring the emotional distance,

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:43.670
or an app that helps soften the blow of it all?

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:46.180
Yes! That's it, that's exactly it.

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:49.410
It's basically the same logic, but you listen when Min Hak says it.

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:52.920
A couple's message frequency over a specific period of time.

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:55.950
Or the frequency of pet names they use for each other.

00:21:56.050 --> 00:22:00.520
Combine health app step-count data with location data from map apps...

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:03.560
to find patterns in the time they spend together.

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:07.400
Changes in their spending history at date spots could also be useful.

00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:11.640
So you really can make it.

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:13.270
Good.

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.810
No, that's my way of saying we can't.

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:18.910
- Oh. - Look, what I just listed off...

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:20.410
is an insane amount of data.

00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:22.750
Even if you could get investors,

00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:26.320
it'd be almost impossible to get a private relationship dataset.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.420
In short, it'd be insanely hard.

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:33.860
It was a good idea, though.

00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:38.300
Really?

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:42.700
Maybe because I've been thinking about this for so long.

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:46.200
I started by writing down my question like this,

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:48.140
(Why do people who fall in love end up falling apart?)

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:51.610
"Why do people who fall in love end up falling apart?"

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:54.240
I just stared at it and thought.

00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:55.950
I see.

00:22:57.550 --> 00:23:00.180
If you were to post that on Instagram,

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:02.250
you'd better keep it on your phone.

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:05.560
No, I wasn't going to post it anywhere.

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:09.590
It's just been the biggest question on my mind since I was little.

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:15.730
You said I'm like a blank slate, a blank canvas, right?

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:17.430
No, not at all.

00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:19.170
The issue of people getting together and breaking up...

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:22.770
that's been a mystery for humanity since the dawn of time.

00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:28.380
I'd look at this and just keep thinking about it.

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:32.920
And whenever an answer came to mind, I'd jot that down, too.

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:34.350
Why bother writing it by hand...

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:35.920
- just to take a picture of it? - I kept thinking...

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:38.260
- You have nice handwriting, though. - what could help our team...

00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:39.260
Oh?

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:40.920
This is...

00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:43.930
I've wondered about this forever.

00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:45.660
I just wish I could figure it out.

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:49.330
Hey, this is surprisingly like the Feynman Algorithm.

00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:51.500
- It is. - What?

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:54.570
Feynman? The Feynman Algorithm.

00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:58.210
If it's something like that, is it a computer language, too?

00:23:58.210 --> 00:23:59.210
Well...

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:01.310
- Pineapple? - Sorry?

00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:02.310
"I'm fine..."

00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:06.050
- I guess it's not related to that. - Yes.

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:08.920
Hey Min Hak, you're really levelling up.

00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:12.290
There's a genius physicist named Richard Feynman.

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:13.820
He said, "With this one algorithm,"

00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:16.030
"one could solve any problem in the world."

00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:18.560
For real? What is it?

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:21.000
One, write down the problem.

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.170
Hold on.

00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:27.100
Two, think really hard.

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:28.740
Three, write down the answer.

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:30.070
Great.

00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:32.940
You're telling me those three steps can really solve anything?

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:35.350
It's not actually a rule that Mr. Feynman came up with.

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:39.350
It's more of a sarcastic take on how he solved problems.

00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:41.020
Still, it's interesting, isn't it?

00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:43.420
The important thing is to face the problem head-on.

00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:44.960
Exactly. It's surprisingly helpful.

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:46.020
Well...

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:47.890
I have my own version of that.

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:50.060
Look.

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.230
This...

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:57.700
I can't see a thing.

00:24:58.270 --> 00:24:59.270
Here, look.

00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:02.070
(Big problem)

00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:04.940
When you write down a big problem in tiny letters like this,

00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:06.910
then all those overwhelming worries...

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:09.950
are just tiny words on a page.

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:14.520
Somehow, it makes me feel a little lighter.

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:17.920
Problem.

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:19.520
(Write down problems, big problem)

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:20.520
My worries.

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:22.330
(Worries...)

00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:27.630
(Mom: What’s your dad up to? I can't get a hold of him.)

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:28.630
Honey.

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:31.970
What's your dad up to? I can't get a hold of him.

00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:34.370
If you see your dad, tell him to call me.

00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:39.710
"First, write down the problem."

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:43.850
"Make my problem smaller."

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:45.280
(Joo Yeon San)

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:46.920
("If you can't explain it simply,")

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:47.950
("you don't understand it well enough." Richard Feynman)

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:50.490
There's a genius physicist named Richard Feynman.

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:52.090
He said, "With this one algorithm,"

00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:54.420
"one could solve any problem in the world."

00:25:56.530 --> 00:25:58.400
What did the number 100 on the cake mean?

00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:01.800
Was it a photo celebrating their 100-day anniversary?

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:04.970
No, it can be a niece or nephew's 100-day.

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:08.000
Darn it. That's not the problem right now.

00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:13.480
Gosh, this is fun. Hey, if we just sell a bit more,

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:16.710
- we could get all new blinds. - Wait, just the blinds?

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:18.150
Let's go get something good to eat.

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:19.250
Right.

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:21.850
We?

00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:26.720
Do you want to play a round of Tekken?

00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:30.390
Right now, our anti-merger banner for Central Plaza is more urgent.

00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:31.660
Okay.

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:35.730
Why get more stuff? It's a headache to split it all up.

00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:39.240
Who will get the Tekken machine? The CompSci Department?

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:40.240
The Model Department?

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.170
Why are you thinking of that now?

00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:47.480
My parents are divorced, so I know. Dividing assets is a real mess.

00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:49.480
Then just don't split up.

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:50.480
What?

00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:52.480
Have you been to the Gangwon Branch Campus?

00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:55.020
No.

00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:58.390
There's one building on a mountain and nothing else around.

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:02.130
A lot of us are professionals, so we have to commute to and from Seoul.

00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:05.900
Since transport is bad, many have taken a leave or just dropped out.

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:07.860
We're mad too...

00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:10.730
that the school just got rid of the Arts and Sports Campus.

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:14.000
But for us, just getting to come here is a huge opportunity.

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:18.780
So let's just try to enjoy ourselves while we're here, okay?

00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:23.780
For someone who said the department jacket was lame,

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:24.780
you sure wear it a lot.

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:27.820
Whatever.

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:30.990
We have to keep selling clothes...

00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:32.920
to cover the budget for the anti-merger protest.

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:33.960
Smile.

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:35.230
Say cheese!

00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:37.590
Smile. Come on.

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:40.030
I said, smile!

00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:42.570
Why won't our engineering school girls smile for the camera?

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:44.100
Requesting assistance.

00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:45.370
(San: Requesting assistance)

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:48.910
- What's going on? - What's it about?

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:51.780
My dad's having an affair.

00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:53.440
- What? - Out of the blue?

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:56.550
I saw him coming out of a motel with some woman yesterday,

00:27:56.650 --> 00:27:59.380
and the problem is when and how to tell my mom.

00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:03.920
Dad is cheating.

00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:08.220
If I tell Mom the truth, there's a lot to consider.

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:11.830
The basic assumption is that no secret stays hidden forever.

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:13.500
Therefore, there's no happy ending.

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:16.670
Instead, considering my mom's pain,

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:19.340
I'm going to choose the method with the lowest "Unhappy Score."

00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:21.840
So, you're trying to quantify your mom's pain?

00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:23.510
An optimization problem.

00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:29.010
Let's set the emotional damage from the betrayal to negative five.

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:33.950
For example, if I keep this a secret from my mom and she finds out later.

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:36.950
Then on top of the negative five points for Dad's betrayal,

00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:40.020
another negative five points should be added for my betrayal.

00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:42.160
But Mom and I are blood relatives.

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:44.460
A marriage is a promise, so the impact differs.

00:28:44.530 --> 00:28:48.630
So I've given Dad's side a bonus impact value of 1.5.

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:51.030
How long the secret is kept will also be a variable.

00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:52.040
Good point.

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:56.810
Learning of Dad's affair right away versus learning of it in ten years,

00:28:56.810 --> 00:28:59.280
or on her deathbed.

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:00.840
The shock would be completely different.

00:29:00.910 --> 00:29:04.210
But if she finds out as she's dying, the initial shock would be huge,

00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:06.280
but the pain wouldn't last long.

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:07.980
So the "Unhappy Score" might be lower.

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:11.590
So what happens to the function once you pass a critical point?

00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:12.990
I'll calculate that.

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:14.960
I think I just need to integrate it.

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:16.960
Hey!

00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:18.630
Are you guys actual psychopaths?

00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:21.660
Who talks about calculus in a situation like this?

00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:24.870
- Okay, whatever. Was she pretty? - What?

00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:26.570
- Do you have a picture? - A picture of what?

00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:29.440
- You didn't take a picture? - No. I saw them from the bus.

00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:33.780
Gosh, you all act so smart, but you're completely clueless.

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:35.250
Go sit down, Joo Yeon San.

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:39.520
All right, listen up.

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:42.150
What's the most important thing here?

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:45.190
- The formula? - Hard evidence.

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:47.690
What's the use of crunching numbers?

00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:49.790
You need a picture of your dad...

00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:52.730
leaving a motel linking arms with another woman...

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:54.730
so he can't deny it, right?

00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:56.070
Hey.

00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:57.970
Which way are you headed?

00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:00.100
I'm going back the way I came.

00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:03.840
He said where he was going, but...

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:05.780
They weren't linking arms or anything.

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:09.080
Are you sure your dad is really cheating?

00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:11.250
I'm sure about that part, but...

00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:17.550
Rosa, Rosa

00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:19.860
I'm your one and only rose

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:24.030
If you dare to touch me, you'll be pricked by my thorns

00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:27.730
If you want a passionate love

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.470
Don't be shy

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:33.140
And hold me in your arms

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.210
Rosa, Rosa

00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:38.680
I'm your one and only rose

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:45.750
Oh my gosh, what is this crap?

00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:50.120
Hey, were you really that into Jinny?

00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:52.490
I...

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:54.320
Rosa, Rosa

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:56.090
I'm your one and only rose

00:30:57.260 --> 00:30:58.860
If you dare to touch me

00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:14.610
Hey, I got a compliment from San today.

00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:16.010
She said I had a great idea.

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:17.810
Don't tell me you went to that meeting again.

00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:20.020
I thought you were just taking attendance in that class.

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:22.950
I mean...

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:27.560
I just talked with her for a bit after I signed in for class.

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:30.960
Min Hak, I told you, you don't need to get mixed up with them anymore.

00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:33.260
That competition and all that...

00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:35.230
were for Jinny.

00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:39.340
Look, let's just put the past behind us...

00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:41.570
and focus on what's ahead.

00:31:41.570 --> 00:31:43.510
But what about Feynman...

00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:44.740
There.

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:48.240
Do you know the Feynman Algorithm?

00:31:48.850 --> 00:31:50.780
I have a lot on my mind.

00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:54.080
I know. I think breaking the problem into small pieces...

00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:55.550
I need some water.

00:31:55.550 --> 00:31:58.520
Seriously, it’s as if age automatically means authority.

00:31:58.590 --> 00:31:59.590
Excuse me.

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:01.290
Do you give discounts on personal training here?

00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:03.930
I don't think so.

00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:06.760
You don't have a blog?

00:32:17.670 --> 00:32:19.480
When on earth are you planning on getting this?

00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:22.110
Oh, right.

00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:33.460
Sorry, I'll grab it soon.

00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:37.530
(Sorry, I'll grab it soon.)

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:43.170
He has really thick eyebrows.

00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:48.740
She put Jinny on the balcony.

00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:51.710
Wait, it's San.
