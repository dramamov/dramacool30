00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.570
Welcome to Hehuan Sect.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:49.969
I toast you all.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:56.729
I'm so forgetful!

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.529
I only heard from Jiao Tong Pavilion

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:59.770
that Lady Kong Hou

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.369
is from Yunhua Sect.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:02.930
I wonder

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.290
which Master

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.169
you study under.

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:06.969
My master is Master Wang Tong.

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:08.250
So you two

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:09.970
must also be from Yunhua Sect.

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.889
No.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:12.850
We met along the way

00:02:12.929 --> 00:02:14.209
and travel together for now.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.329
(Good.)

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:17.209
(Just Yunhua Sect)

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.489
(is troublesome enough.)

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.209
I must apologize

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.169
for letting you

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:24.530
suffer such a fright

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.290
in Hehuan Sect.

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:27.370
I've already ordered

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:28.850
Jiao Tong Pavilion closed.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.769
I've never imagined

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.530
that such a scum

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:35.290
was hiding.

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:36.810
It's my failure.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.570
My apologies again.

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.530
Please, enjoy yourselves.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.209
I wonder if Yi City's food

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.169
suits

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:49.609
Lady Kong Hou's taste?

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:52.209
It's fine, really.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.130
Kong Hou.

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:59.530
Aren't you afraid

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.370
it's poisoned?

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:02.729
No worries.

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:04.250
I'm immune to anything.

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:05.370
It's okay.

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.090
Still, be careful.

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:09.530
Tonight,

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:11.130
I arranged for dancers

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:12.530
to entertain everyone.

00:04:45.329 --> 00:04:46.570
Don't worry, my Lord.

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:47.769
That

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:49.610
was Hehuan Sect's hypnosis spell.

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:50.769
They won't wake up

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:51.810
for quite some time.

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:54.289
I only want this woman.

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:55.570
As for the two men...

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.130
Detain them.

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.649
Watch them closely.

00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:59.769
Understood.

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:24.250
I couldn't read anything...

00:05:24.769 --> 00:05:25.730
Unless...

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:27.889
It's suppressed by some

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:29.130
strong formation.

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:10.889
Do you know,

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:12.170
if it weren't for me,

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:13.810
you'd already be dead

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:15.529
in Old Wu Bei's hands?

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:17.610
Who's Wu Bei?

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:19.570
Why did he try to kill me?

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:21.209
I only remember

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:23.649
the dancers performing.

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.930
And then...

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:27.170
Why am I here?

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:29.329
You little heartless thing.

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:31.130
Why ask so many questions?

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:33.769
Forget it.

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:35.529
Just remember this.

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.490
From now on,

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.370
you are

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:42.889
my pretty boy.

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:46.010
If you obey me faithfully,

00:06:46.329 --> 00:06:47.769
I'll give you anything.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.170
I'm so mediocre.

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:51.930
You really want me, Master Ouyang?

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:54.289
Are you willing?

00:06:54.969 --> 00:06:55.730
Master Ouyang,

00:06:55.769 --> 00:06:57.250
you haven't answered my question.

00:06:57.409 --> 00:06:58.969
Even if I'm willing to follow you,

00:06:59.209 --> 00:07:00.969
I have to make things clear.

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:07.370
Old Wu Bei

00:07:07.769 --> 00:07:08.849
is after the girl

00:07:08.849 --> 00:07:10.089
traveling with you.

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.050
He knew she wanted

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:13.610
apprenticeship from Jiao Tong,

00:07:13.769 --> 00:07:15.209
so he enlisted my help.

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:16.849
But

00:07:16.889 --> 00:07:18.250
she was such a handful.

00:07:18.449 --> 00:07:20.289
Wasting so much of my effort.

00:07:21.089 --> 00:07:22.889
Why does he want her?

00:07:23.409 --> 00:07:24.690
I don't know.

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:26.170
Maybe

00:07:26.209 --> 00:07:27.969
she offended him somehow.

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:29.570
Forget about them.

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:31.730
Let's enjoy our time.

00:07:37.889 --> 00:07:39.209
You broke the chains?

00:07:39.329 --> 00:07:40.930
Those were blacksteel,

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:42.130
reinforced

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:43.610
with our special talismans.

00:07:44.289 --> 00:07:45.570
Who exactly are you?

00:07:48.889 --> 00:07:50.289
You're Master Zhong Xi!

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:12.930
Jiao Tong?

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:15.769
It's been ages since we drank together.

00:08:16.409 --> 00:08:17.370
Come on.

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:18.490
What's going on?

00:08:19.089 --> 00:08:19.969
Where are they?

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:24.930
Take a drink

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:26.769
and I'll tell you.

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:29.849
What exactly do you want?

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:31.649
What do I want?

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:39.649
What do I want?

00:08:47.289 --> 00:08:49.529
You're never around these days.

00:08:51.529 --> 00:08:52.769
I haven't drunk for days.

00:08:52.889 --> 00:08:53.809
Let's have a drink.

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:56.610
Drink less.

00:08:58.330 --> 00:08:59.130
Don't worry.

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:00.330
You're

00:09:00.529 --> 00:09:02.330
breaking through stages.

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:03.370
Must be tough, right?

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:05.250
To be honest, I've been...

00:09:07.649 --> 00:09:08.649
Don't worry.

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:10.569
I'm here.

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:14.929
I'll get you through

00:09:15.049 --> 00:09:16.210
Golden Core tribulation

00:09:16.289 --> 00:09:17.769
safe and sound.

00:09:17.769 --> 00:09:19.130
Stop pulling me! Stop!

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:20.010
Come with me.

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:23.130
With these girls around,

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:25.010
you don't have to fear the tribulation!

00:09:25.769 --> 00:09:26.649
Even my cultivation

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:28.569
could reach new heights.

00:09:32.409 --> 00:09:34.210
- Young master.
- Young master.

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:35.689
Come over here.

00:09:35.689 --> 00:09:37.450
Come here. Young Master.

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:38.889
Young master.

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:40.090
Demons should

00:09:40.809 --> 00:09:42.689
walk the demon path.

00:09:43.409 --> 00:09:44.929
Nonsense!

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:47.330
That's an evil path!

00:09:49.289 --> 00:09:50.409
You hit me?

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:52.010
A few days studying

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:53.049
at Liuguang Sect

00:09:53.169 --> 00:09:54.689
really changed you a lot!

00:09:55.169 --> 00:09:56.289
But remember.

00:09:56.569 --> 00:09:57.689
You're a demon!

00:09:58.289 --> 00:10:00.049
You abandoned your true nature

00:10:00.169 --> 00:10:01.970
and tried to live like a human.

00:10:02.169 --> 00:10:03.330
Do you really think

00:10:03.689 --> 00:10:05.210
they will ever accept you?

00:10:05.689 --> 00:10:06.970
You're a demon!

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:08.010
That

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:09.649
will never change!

00:10:10.049 --> 00:10:11.850
That's my own choice.

00:10:12.649 --> 00:10:13.769
Not your concern.

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:16.010
Fine.

00:10:16.289 --> 00:10:17.809
But as your brother,

00:10:17.929 --> 00:10:19.490
I'll show you what a demon should be!

00:10:25.569 --> 00:10:26.649
Are you insane?

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:42.529
From now on,

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:45.250
you're on your own.

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:46.490
My path

00:10:47.049 --> 00:10:48.330
is different from yours!

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:51.490
To become human,

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:53.210
you're willing

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:54.330
to be a servant!

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:57.210
Is that the path you want?

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:01.850
How could you break

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:03.210
the Stone Shackles?

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:04.649
I warned you before.

00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:06.490
Your cultivation path

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:08.010
is crooked.

00:11:08.929 --> 00:11:10.929
Turn back now

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:12.929
and I'll spare you.

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:18.250
Look at that disgusted face.

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:21.730
Spending too long with humans,

00:11:21.929 --> 00:11:24.210
you learned to be as fake as them.

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:26.169
What's so great about them?

00:11:26.809 --> 00:11:28.649
Look at Hehuan Sect's head.

00:11:28.809 --> 00:11:30.610
Paragon of righteousness?

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:31.689
Spouting

00:11:31.809 --> 00:11:33.809
noble words

00:11:34.049 --> 00:11:36.210
yet collaborates with demon cultivators!

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:37.250
I told you.

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:39.569
Not all humans are the same.

00:11:40.769 --> 00:11:41.809
I know.

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:43.929
You mean that Young Master

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:46.049
and that girl.

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:47.769
What a pity.

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:50.370
They'll both die soon.

00:11:51.409 --> 00:11:52.049
And there's

00:11:52.169 --> 00:11:53.970
a meddling Lady

00:11:54.569 --> 00:11:56.289
locked up in my quarters.

00:11:56.409 --> 00:11:57.529
What's it again?

00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:00.210
Ling Bo.

00:12:00.529 --> 00:12:01.929
She's from Zhaohan Sect.

00:12:02.049 --> 00:12:02.850
What?

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:05.090
You know her?

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:07.409
Not really.

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:09.250
You know her very well.

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:10.809
I said I don't.

00:12:12.689 --> 00:12:13.730
Lin Hu.

00:12:13.929 --> 00:12:15.490
You haven't changed at all.

00:12:15.769 --> 00:12:17.169
The more you care,

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:19.169
the more indifferent you pretend to be.

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:20.649
Out with it.

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:22.409
What's your relationship

00:12:22.569 --> 00:12:24.370
with Ling Bo?

00:12:24.569 --> 00:12:25.490
I've told you.

00:12:25.809 --> 00:12:27.130
I don't know her.

00:12:27.169 --> 00:12:28.049
We're not close.

00:12:28.049 --> 00:12:29.169
Understood?

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:32.610
You like her.

00:12:33.689 --> 00:12:34.569
Nonsense!

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:37.569
Lin Hu.

00:12:37.809 --> 00:12:39.049
Think it carefully.

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:40.649
Who is she?

00:12:41.409 --> 00:12:44.929
The prized disciple
of Zhaohan Sect's head.

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:46.330
She's

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:48.210
the future heir,

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:50.169
totally exceptional.

00:12:50.889 --> 00:12:51.970
And you?

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:56.610
Just a foolish fox demon.

00:12:58.289 --> 00:12:59.529
I've told you.

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:01.569
Humans and demons walk different paths.

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:03.130
It seems

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:05.569
I can't let her go now.

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:07.450
I'm warning you.

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:09.610
Don't touch her.

00:13:10.529 --> 00:13:11.330
Fine.

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:13.289
I agree.

00:13:13.529 --> 00:13:14.730
I will

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:16.689
put the past down.

00:13:17.929 --> 00:13:19.889
As for that young man,

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:21.490
I'm not interested at all.

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:23.889
I only want you to stay

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:25.569
and return to the demon path.

00:13:26.889 --> 00:13:28.370
That's my price.

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:30.409
No way.

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:32.569
In that case,

00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:34.569
we're done.

00:14:09.929 --> 00:14:11.210
In one hour,

00:14:11.809 --> 00:14:13.250
your cultivation will dissipate.

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:16.010
You won't be able to cultivate again.

00:14:16.529 --> 00:14:17.889
You keep me alive...

00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:22.049
You keep me alive

00:14:22.889 --> 00:14:24.130
only to let me wander

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:25.409
this world alone?

00:14:26.409 --> 00:14:28.289
Do you know

00:14:28.809 --> 00:14:30.169
how cruel that is?

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.210
Why not kill me?

00:14:40.769 --> 00:14:41.850
Take care.

00:14:56.049 --> 00:14:56.730
Jiao Tong!

00:14:58.010 --> 00:14:58.809
Jiao Tong!

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:00.769
Why must you do this?

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:03.090
My fate is controlled

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:05.130
by myself.

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:54.090
I must break the seal.

00:15:58.049 --> 00:15:58.809
Young Master.

00:16:05.649 --> 00:16:06.330
It's bad.

00:16:06.649 --> 00:16:08.090
Young Master, we're too late.

00:16:08.929 --> 00:16:10.210
Stay here and watch her.

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:35.130
(Her spiritual root has awakened.)

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:36.970
(I can't fight her head-on.)

00:16:38.689 --> 00:16:40.289
Come with me now,

00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:41.409
and I promise

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:44.289
Lord will treat you well.

00:17:05.769 --> 00:17:06.450
Young Master.

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:07.650
Are you okay?

00:17:07.769 --> 00:17:08.930
I've contacted the sect

00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:09.650
to deal

00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:10.849
with those scums.

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:12.210
Go to Yi City first.

00:17:12.369 --> 00:17:13.250
Once I'm done here,

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:14.010
I'll come find you.

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:15.170
Take care of yourself.

00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:16.329
If there's danger,

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:17.970
send a messenger talisman immediately.

00:17:18.049 --> 00:17:18.809
Don't worry.

00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:20.450
Stay cautious.

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:21.410
Understood.

00:17:26.809 --> 00:17:28.490
Why is there an egg here?

00:17:28.529 --> 00:17:29.970
Huan Zong, that is strange.

00:17:30.069 --> 00:17:30.569
Could it

00:17:30.569 --> 00:17:31.970
fall from the tree?

00:17:32.289 --> 00:17:33.329
I'll keep it

00:17:33.329 --> 00:17:34.450
in my pouch for now.

00:17:34.569 --> 00:17:35.289
This way,

00:17:35.289 --> 00:17:36.450
if a hatchling emerges,

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:37.569
I can take care of it.

00:17:38.769 --> 00:17:39.930
Get in the carriage first.

00:17:40.529 --> 00:17:41.089
Okay.

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:50.250
Kong Hou.

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:53.289
Kong Hou.

00:17:57.250 --> 00:17:58.250
Huan Zong.

00:17:58.490 --> 00:17:59.369
Why

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:00.930
do you think that dark cultivator

00:18:01.049 --> 00:18:02.849
targeted me?

00:18:03.529 --> 00:18:05.609
Dark cultivators capture righteous ones

00:18:05.609 --> 00:18:06.809
to test forbidden arts.

00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:08.410
It's not uncommon.

00:18:09.529 --> 00:18:10.849
But I feel

00:18:10.849 --> 00:18:12.730
things are not that simple.

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:13.609
Moreover,

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:15.569
why did I suddenly

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:17.049
get so strong?

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:18.809
You always said

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:20.890
the world is full of strange things.

00:18:21.129 --> 00:18:22.529
You have no spiritual root,

00:18:22.809 --> 00:18:23.769
but you activated

00:18:23.769 --> 00:18:25.609
a cultivation bond with me.

00:18:26.089 --> 00:18:27.170
That means

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:29.049
some unknown power is inside you.

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:30.490
Perhaps Wu Bei

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:32.210
was after precisely that power.

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:35.329
But for all these years,

00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:36.569
I've always been

00:18:36.569 --> 00:18:38.450
a talentless weakling in cultivation.

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:41.170
How could I suddenly...

00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:43.930
You've wanted

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:45.010
to boost cultivation

00:18:45.089 --> 00:18:46.569
and become a heroine.

00:18:47.289 --> 00:18:48.210
Stronger energy

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:48.970
is a good thing.

00:18:49.049 --> 00:18:50.970
But it's gone now!

00:18:51.129 --> 00:18:52.250
If that dark cultivator

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:53.369
comes again,

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:55.450
I'm done for.

00:18:56.129 --> 00:18:56.970
Don't worry.

00:18:57.569 --> 00:18:58.930
You have me,

00:18:59.089 --> 00:19:00.210
Lin Hu,

00:19:00.369 --> 00:19:01.410
and your Master.

00:19:02.369 --> 00:19:03.250
True.

00:19:03.529 --> 00:19:04.609
You're right.

00:19:04.769 --> 00:19:05.809
I have you all

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:06.970
by my side.

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:10.410
I'm not afraid.

00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:41.410
Where is he?

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:43.690
Jiao Tong! Get out here!

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:47.569
Excuse me.

00:19:48.289 --> 00:19:48.970
Excuse me.

00:19:49.369 --> 00:19:50.329
Watch out.

00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:52.129
Jiao Tong!

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:04.769
It's you.

00:20:05.369 --> 00:20:06.609
Are you working with Jiao Tong?

00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:07.936
What?

00:20:07.936 --> 00:20:08.849
I'm here to save you.

00:20:08.849 --> 00:20:09.849
You let him go.

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:11.769
What? I let him go?

00:20:11.769 --> 00:20:12.269
I...

00:20:12.609 --> 00:20:13.369
Y-You...

00:20:13.369 --> 00:20:14.569
Lower your sword.

00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:15.970
Release them first.

00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:17.809
Okay.

00:20:17.809 --> 00:20:18.309
Go.

00:20:19.049 --> 00:20:20.450
Thank you, fairy.

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:21.129
Thank you.

00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:22.129
Thank you, fairy.

00:20:22.129 --> 00:20:23.049
Hurry!

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:26.970
Take this down.

00:20:28.329 --> 00:20:29.129
Well.

00:20:29.609 --> 00:20:30.650
Are you alright?

00:20:30.809 --> 00:20:32.210
I'm perfectly good.

00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:35.529
What's happening?

00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:37.410
So...

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:39.049
That is

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:40.129
what happened.

00:20:40.289 --> 00:20:42.170
After Jiao Tong died, I...

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:44.609
What? You killed him?

00:20:45.369 --> 00:20:47.210
Why did you kill him?

00:20:47.369 --> 00:20:48.609
I wanted to take him back!

00:20:49.089 --> 00:20:49.930
Do you know

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:51.089
what he wanted

00:20:51.089 --> 00:20:51.930
with those captured?

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:53.210
I don't know.

00:20:53.569 --> 00:20:55.410
He meant to skin them alive

00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:57.289
to preserve his handsome face.

00:20:58.010 --> 00:20:59.010
That monster

00:20:59.049 --> 00:21:00.170
was the top music cultivator

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:01.089
of Lingyou Realm.

00:21:01.129 --> 00:21:02.809
And he committed such atrocities!

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:04.250
If I brought him back,

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:05.930
it would be a great merit.

00:21:06.089 --> 00:21:07.809
Yet you killed him!

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:09.730
You meddled here

00:21:09.769 --> 00:21:11.010
just to claim merit?

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:13.490
Meddling?

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:14.369
Didn't you see

00:21:14.369 --> 00:21:15.769
I just saved those women?

00:21:15.769 --> 00:21:17.369
You saved them to get merit.

00:21:17.369 --> 00:21:18.369
So what?

00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:19.930
Isn't

00:21:20.089 --> 00:21:21.609
the result the same?

00:21:25.369 --> 00:21:26.529
Why are you staring at me?

00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:27.809
Nothing. Let's go.

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:29.809
What?

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:31.210
Do you know

00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:32.690
where Fengyi is?

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:33.410
Fengyi?

00:21:33.569 --> 00:21:34.650
My sense

00:21:35.049 --> 00:21:36.289
of direction isn't great.

00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:37.569
Why are you going to Fengyi?

00:21:38.849 --> 00:21:40.250
To

00:21:40.529 --> 00:21:42.010
look for my senior Chang De.

00:21:46.874 --> 00:21:48.730
(Qingquan Inn)

00:21:49.769 --> 00:21:50.849
Welcome. How many of you?

00:21:51.289 --> 00:21:52.369
I want that one.

00:21:53.089 --> 00:21:54.049
I'll get it for you.

00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:54.769
Okay.

00:21:59.609 --> 00:22:00.289
You're back.

00:22:03.289 --> 00:22:04.210
Lin Hu.

00:22:10.049 --> 00:22:11.129
What's wrong with you?

00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:12.970
Would you like something to eat?

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:24.490
(Huan Zong.)

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:26.450
(Lin Hu seems so distressed.)

00:22:26.569 --> 00:22:27.170
(Is it because)

00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:28.450
(of Jiao Tong?)

00:22:29.809 --> 00:22:30.849
(After all,)

00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:32.490
(they once cultivated together.)

00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:35.289
(If Senior Ling Hui went astray)

00:22:35.329 --> 00:22:36.690
(and I had to end her myself...)

00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:38.450
(I'd be heartbroken too.)

00:22:38.529 --> 00:22:39.329
(Let's find a way)

00:22:39.329 --> 00:22:40.450
(to cheer him up.)

00:22:41.329 --> 00:22:42.809
(What's the best restaurant)

00:22:42.809 --> 00:22:43.730
(in Yi City?)

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:45.490
(Let me think it over.)

00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:48.650
(I've got it.)

00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:49.849
(This)

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:50.609
(was given)

00:22:50.609 --> 00:22:51.930
(by Elder Qiu Shuang.)

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:53.170
(It's a full guide)

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:54.730
(to the entire Lingyou Realm.)

00:22:58.609 --> 00:22:59.730
(Let me check)

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:01.569
(for recommended spots.)

00:23:04.049 --> 00:23:05.049
What's she saying?

00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:11.490
(Here!)

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:12.690
(Huan Zong, look.)

00:23:12.849 --> 00:23:14.569
(Yi City has many scenic spots.)

00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:16.129
(It says the Cuiming Mountains)

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:17.369
(have Lingyou Realm's)

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:19.250
(largest long-haired apes)

00:23:19.329 --> 00:23:20.329
(and the best)

00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:22.250
(spiritual fruit orchards.)

00:23:22.289 --> 00:23:24.089
(Let's take Lin Hu there.)

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:25.930
(Agreed.)

00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:27.490
(Also,)

00:23:27.529 --> 00:23:29.529
(we could take him for foot massage.)

00:23:29.809 --> 00:23:31.650
(Good idea.)

00:23:34.609 --> 00:23:35.529
(And...)

00:23:35.569 --> 00:23:36.809
(As his friends,)

00:23:36.809 --> 00:23:38.289
(we should support him)

00:23:38.289 --> 00:23:39.250
(when it matters.)

00:23:39.329 --> 00:23:41.250
(Sharing both joys and hardships.)

00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:43.170
(But I keep feeling)

00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:44.369
(something's missing.)

00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:45.410
(What's missing?)

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:50.490
(Friendship tattoos.)

00:23:50.569 --> 00:23:52.049
(Let's all get matching ones.)

00:23:52.849 --> 00:23:55.129
Let's skip the friendship tattoos.

00:23:55.129 --> 00:23:55.730
Kong Hou.

00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:57.170
I really...

00:23:57.170 --> 00:23:58.529
I really can't do it.

00:23:58.529 --> 00:23:59.490
You don't get it.

00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:01.344
Friendship tattoos
are symbols of loyalty.

00:24:01.344 --> 00:24:02.848
I won't let others tattoo with me!

00:24:02.848 --> 00:24:03.529
N-No.

00:24:03.569 --> 00:24:04.369
The thing is...

00:24:04.369 --> 00:24:05.129
I...

00:24:05.129 --> 00:24:05.930
Lin Hu.

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:07.289
How did you enter

00:24:07.289 --> 00:24:09.250
my communication barrier with Huan Zong?

00:24:12.369 --> 00:24:13.609
I gave him the passcode.

00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:15.329
Huan Zong!

00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:16.730
I was going to surprise him.

00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:18.690
That's not a surprise.

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:19.970
That's a shock.

00:24:22.329 --> 00:24:23.010
Huan Zong.

00:24:23.369 --> 00:24:25.049
Do you want matching tattoos with me?

00:24:25.089 --> 00:24:26.049
My Master's

00:24:26.049 --> 00:24:27.369
looks impressive.

00:24:28.049 --> 00:24:29.170
That sounds good.

00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:29.849
Kong Hou.

00:24:29.849 --> 00:24:30.609
Take Young Master.

00:24:30.609 --> 00:24:31.890
He'll love it.

00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:32.569
You can do that.

00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:34.250
Want one?

00:24:35.329 --> 00:24:35.829
Get one!

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:36.529
Just eat.

00:24:39.450 --> 00:24:42.604
(Yi City Inn)

00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:45.089
Are you Lady Kong Hou?

00:24:45.369 --> 00:24:46.569
Yes, what's wrong?

00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:47.970
This package is for you.

00:24:49.569 --> 00:24:50.410
Who sent it?

00:24:50.569 --> 00:24:51.289
This is large.

00:24:51.609 --> 00:24:52.490
Must be

00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:53.569
from my sect.

00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:05.769
All these

00:25:05.809 --> 00:25:06.569
are birthday gifts

00:25:06.569 --> 00:25:07.930
from your sect?

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:08.970
Yeah.

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:10.490
So many things.

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:11.890
Why not put them in your pouch?

00:25:12.289 --> 00:25:13.289
That

00:25:13.289 --> 00:25:14.809
kills the ceremony!

00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:21.129
Huan Zong, look.

00:25:21.129 --> 00:25:22.329
Is this pretty?

00:25:22.529 --> 00:25:23.089
Yes.

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:25.809
What about this?

00:25:26.129 --> 00:25:27.129
Is this pretty?

00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:27.849
Yes.

00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:29.329
And this.

00:25:29.329 --> 00:25:30.129
Isn't it unique?

00:25:31.089 --> 00:25:31.769
Yes.

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:35.289
Perfunctory.

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:37.170
What am I supposed to say?

00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:38.769
Ugly. Not special at all.

00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:41.170
Senior was right.

00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:42.010
Men

00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:43.210
really can't talk properly.

00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:49.529
Happy birthday, my dear.

00:25:49.769 --> 00:25:51.210
All my hidden treasures

00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:51.890
are here.

00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:53.089
Be sure to stay safe.

00:25:53.089 --> 00:25:53.769
Eat less junk,

00:25:53.769 --> 00:25:55.170
so you don't get sick.

00:25:56.650 --> 00:25:58.089
Ouch. Enough talk. I'm off.

00:25:58.089 --> 00:25:59.890
- Don't upset your stomach like me.
- Don't upset your stomach like me.

00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:02.170
Huan Zong, you're amazing.

00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:04.129
You sound exactly like my master.

00:26:05.529 --> 00:26:06.809
It's your birthday.

00:26:06.809 --> 00:26:07.769
I want to...

00:26:08.129 --> 00:26:09.490
What do you want to do?

00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:13.049
It's your birthday.

00:26:13.289 --> 00:26:14.529
I want to give you

00:26:14.529 --> 00:26:15.970
a gift with Lin Hu.

00:26:18.129 --> 00:26:18.970
What do you want?

00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:22.210
Well...

00:26:26.769 --> 00:26:28.410
Why waste the efforts?

00:26:28.609 --> 00:26:29.849
If you really want sweet cakes,

00:26:29.849 --> 00:26:31.250
I'll have Lin Hu buy some.

00:26:31.569 --> 00:26:33.250
How could that be the same?

00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:34.289
Back then,

00:26:34.289 --> 00:26:35.369
on my birthdays,

00:26:35.529 --> 00:26:36.890
Senior Ling Hui always

00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:38.129
made me sweet cakes.

00:26:38.289 --> 00:26:39.809
Now that I'm out traveling,

00:26:39.849 --> 00:26:40.890
I'll make one myself.

00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:42.129
That's needed for a birthday.

00:26:43.089 --> 00:26:44.250
By the way, Huan Zong.

00:26:44.369 --> 00:26:45.490
Is it that none of disciples

00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:46.250
in Liuguang Sect

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:47.849
know how to cook?

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:49.010
Essentially.

00:26:49.369 --> 00:26:50.730
If

00:26:50.809 --> 00:26:52.529
a girl who doesn't fast

00:26:52.529 --> 00:26:53.650
marries

00:26:53.650 --> 00:26:54.890
into your sect,

00:26:55.049 --> 00:26:56.930
wouldn't she starve?

00:26:57.730 --> 00:26:59.010
I don't cook,

00:26:59.329 --> 00:27:00.849
but I can hire someone cook for her.

00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:02.450
Showing off your wealth, huh?

00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:03.049
No.

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:04.609
I won't share

00:27:04.609 --> 00:27:05.849
my cake with you.

00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:13.730
Kong Hou.

00:27:14.529 --> 00:27:16.129
You've got flour on your face.

00:27:16.569 --> 00:27:17.289
Raise your head.

00:27:17.289 --> 00:27:18.010
I'll wipe it off.

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:22.650
I'll fix your hair too.

00:27:23.529 --> 00:27:25.170
So much.

00:27:25.809 --> 00:27:26.490
Really?

00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:27.569
You're so careless.

00:27:27.569 --> 00:27:28.410
Plenty here too.

00:27:29.089 --> 00:27:29.769
Done?

00:27:29.769 --> 00:27:31.049
Almost... There...

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:33.150
Done.

00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:33.809
All clean.

00:27:34.129 --> 00:27:35.129
Thank you, Huan Zong.

00:27:35.129 --> 00:27:35.890
My pleasure.

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:42.410
Huan Zong, were you teasing me?

00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:43.650
My face!

00:27:44.089 --> 00:27:45.529
It's cute, isn't it?

00:27:46.289 --> 00:27:47.010
Missed!

00:27:47.769 --> 00:27:48.690
Missed again!

00:27:52.450 --> 00:27:56.515
♪Clouds gather and part,
as I turn to find you still here♪

00:27:56.515 --> 00:27:58.784
♪In the mortal realm,
flowers hush, birds quiet♪

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:03.453
♪Carrying peach blossoms home♪

00:28:15.609 --> 00:28:16.450
Wait.

00:28:17.609 --> 00:28:18.369
What's wrong?

00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:19.569
Make a wish first.

00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:21.890
Right!

00:28:28.809 --> 00:28:30.210
What's this?

00:28:30.369 --> 00:28:31.210
A wishing flower.

00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:35.329
So beautiful!

00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:36.769
If I make a wish upon it,

00:28:36.769 --> 00:28:38.089
it'll come true.

00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:39.289
Thank you, Huan Zong.

00:28:43.089 --> 00:28:45.529
(May Master stay healthy.)

00:28:45.769 --> 00:28:47.210
(May my seniors)

00:28:47.289 --> 00:28:48.289
(achieve greater stages.)

00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:49.690
(May...)

00:28:55.849 --> 00:28:56.650
You wished for long.

00:28:56.970 --> 00:28:57.970
How greedy.

00:28:58.289 --> 00:28:59.769
You must have made many wishes.

00:29:00.289 --> 00:29:01.410
How do you know that?

00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:02.730
Everyone's greedy.

00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:04.609
I even know what you wished for.

00:29:04.609 --> 00:29:05.210
Do you believe?

00:29:05.289 --> 00:29:06.490
Do you?

00:29:06.529 --> 00:29:07.369
Then tell me,

00:29:07.369 --> 00:29:08.450
what did I wish for?

00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:09.609
Let me guess.

00:29:09.809 --> 00:29:10.849
Your first wish

00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:12.450
is for your master.

00:29:12.769 --> 00:29:13.490
You are

00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:14.849
closest to him.

00:29:15.089 --> 00:29:16.609
I bet the first wish was

00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:19.010
for his long life and health.

00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:21.970
Continue.

00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:23.769
The second wish

00:29:23.809 --> 00:29:24.730
should be for

00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:26.210
your fellow disciples.

00:29:28.369 --> 00:29:29.849
I presume the second wish is

00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:31.730
that your seniors

00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:33.609
advance further in their cultivation.

00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:37.289
Are my thoughts

00:29:37.289 --> 00:29:38.730
that easy to guess?

00:29:39.049 --> 00:29:39.849
However,

00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:41.369
you'll never guess

00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:42.930
my third wish.

00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:45.450
Truly greedy.

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:46.890
The third wish,

00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:48.369
I truly can't fathom.

00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:49.289
Tell me what's it.

00:29:49.609 --> 00:29:51.410
My third wish

00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:52.490
is...

00:29:53.849 --> 00:29:55.010
I won't tell you.

00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:56.730
Huan Zong.

00:29:57.010 --> 00:29:58.450
You'll be the first one

00:29:58.450 --> 00:30:00.529
to taste the cake I made.

00:30:01.329 --> 00:30:02.329
I'm fasting.

00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:05.010
I know you are.

00:30:05.049 --> 00:30:07.210
But today's my birthday.

00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:09.210
Just one bite.

00:30:09.369 --> 00:30:10.329
One.

00:30:10.769 --> 00:30:12.450
- Take a bite.
- You enjoy it.

00:30:14.529 --> 00:30:15.210
Fine.

00:30:15.329 --> 00:30:17.650
I'll eat.

00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:18.930
Eating all of it myself.

00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:20.049
Not leaving you a crumb.

00:30:30.464 --> 00:30:35.175
♪Waiting for time to slow♪

00:30:38.688 --> 00:30:43.394
♪Oceans turn to dust in mere moments♪

00:30:46.308 --> 00:30:49.376
♪Fleeting dreams♪

00:30:52.049 --> 00:30:53.410
Huan Zong, look!

00:30:53.609 --> 00:30:54.650
How beautiful!

00:30:54.970 --> 00:30:55.690
Over there.

00:30:56.490 --> 00:30:57.849
So many fireworks.

00:31:00.809 --> 00:31:01.809
Happy time, huh?

00:31:06.369 --> 00:31:08.170
What's moving inside?

00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:10.329
In your storage pouch?

00:31:10.849 --> 00:31:11.529
Right.

00:31:14.129 --> 00:31:14.970
Oh, no.

00:31:15.289 --> 00:31:16.010
It can't be

00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:17.609
the food I stored

00:31:18.089 --> 00:31:20.490
has spoiled and bred worms again!

00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:21.129
"Again"?

00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:23.730
Don't dwell on such details.

00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:24.769
Let me check.

00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:31.450
It's the egg I found

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:32.609
at Hehuan Sect.

00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:34.690
Why's it growing wood ears?

00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:36.490
These aren't wood ears.

00:31:37.289 --> 00:31:38.609
Don't you recognize this?

00:31:38.849 --> 00:31:40.369
It looks so bizarre.

00:31:40.369 --> 00:31:41.490
I've never seen it.

00:31:41.609 --> 00:31:42.809
It's Azure Jade Fungus.

00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:43.930
What?

00:31:44.010 --> 00:31:45.769
Azure Jade Fungus?

00:31:46.010 --> 00:31:47.569
That's incredible!

00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:49.170
My third wish

00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:50.010
is to quickly

00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:51.490
find the spirit herb you need.

00:31:51.609 --> 00:31:53.369
It comes true now!

00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:54.089
Huan Zong.

00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:55.849
Your wishing flower truly works wonders.

00:31:57.049 --> 00:31:58.049
Your

00:31:58.970 --> 00:32:00.690
last wish

00:32:02.369 --> 00:32:03.730
is to seek herbs for me?

00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:08.369
Huan Zong, take this.

00:32:26.129 --> 00:32:26.849
Brother!

00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:29.250
Brother, what's wrong?

00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:32.369
Brother!

00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:39.849
What happened, brother?

00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:48.170
I found someone

00:32:48.329 --> 00:32:50.250
with once-in-a-millennium talent!

00:32:50.410 --> 00:32:51.650
Did you?

00:32:51.930 --> 00:32:54.250
But she has a seal

00:32:54.569 --> 00:32:56.250
suppressing her energy.

00:32:56.450 --> 00:32:58.369
Can't you break it?

00:33:00.930 --> 00:33:03.170
The power of that seal is formidable.

00:33:03.569 --> 00:33:04.890
But it doesn't matter.

00:33:05.089 --> 00:33:06.690
There must be a way.

00:33:06.809 --> 00:33:09.010
We are so lucky.

00:33:09.129 --> 00:33:09.970
Don't worry, brother.

00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:11.529
Let's find a way

00:33:11.609 --> 00:33:13.170
to get her.

00:33:13.529 --> 00:33:14.730
Presenting her to the Lord

00:33:14.809 --> 00:33:16.890
would be a big merit!

00:33:53.010 --> 00:33:55.049
Young Master, I just don't get it.

00:33:55.210 --> 00:33:56.369
How does Kong Hou

00:33:56.609 --> 00:33:57.329
always get

00:33:57.329 --> 00:33:58.289
exactly what she needs

00:33:58.289 --> 00:33:59.450
at the perfect moment?

00:33:59.529 --> 00:34:00.410
Coincidence.

00:34:00.569 --> 00:34:01.250
Coincidence?

00:34:01.289 --> 00:34:02.450
Her luck is insane.

00:34:02.769 --> 00:34:03.809
What's wrong with that?

00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:07.089
Young Master.

00:34:07.369 --> 00:34:08.249
What's that?

00:34:08.930 --> 00:34:10.209
Someone's undergoing tribulation.

00:34:10.209 --> 00:34:10.970
Tribulation?

00:34:11.129 --> 00:34:12.129
Who?

00:34:15.609 --> 00:34:17.609
Could it be Kong Hou?

00:34:17.609 --> 00:34:18.729
She just reached Foundation.

00:34:18.729 --> 00:34:19.410
She's advancing

00:34:19.410 --> 00:34:20.089
so fast!

00:34:20.089 --> 00:34:21.089
Wait for me!

00:34:23.249 --> 00:34:24.049
Kong Hou!

00:34:25.049 --> 00:34:26.850
Young Master, what's happening?

00:34:26.850 --> 00:34:27.649
What's that?

00:34:27.850 --> 00:34:28.850
A barrier.

00:34:29.129 --> 00:34:30.770
It's blocking her advancement.

00:34:31.649 --> 00:34:33.049
She's in agony.

00:34:33.370 --> 00:34:34.930
She can't endure much longer.

00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:36.330
I'll shatter the barrier.

00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:36.970
Don't.

00:34:36.970 --> 00:34:39.168
Without the barrier,
she can't bear the thunder strike!

00:34:39.168 --> 00:34:39.890
I'll bear it.

00:35:47.410 --> 00:35:48.209
Huan Zong!

00:36:03.370 --> 00:36:04.129
Kong Hou.

00:36:12.209 --> 00:36:13.010
Huan Zong.

00:36:13.609 --> 00:36:15.729
You scared me to death.

00:36:16.209 --> 00:36:17.370
I thought you...

00:36:19.649 --> 00:36:20.490
Thank goodness.

00:36:22.729 --> 00:36:24.209
What was

00:36:24.410 --> 00:36:25.930
that phoenix symbol?

00:36:48.370 --> 00:36:49.249
Kong Hou.

00:36:49.689 --> 00:36:50.729
I knocked.

00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:52.410
You didn't answer, so I entered.

00:36:55.729 --> 00:36:57.089
Still thinking about earlier?

00:36:58.890 --> 00:37:00.209
How's Lin Hu?

00:37:00.209 --> 00:37:01.010
He's fine.

00:37:01.049 --> 00:37:02.089
Just resting.

00:37:04.649 --> 00:37:05.569
And you?

00:37:06.169 --> 00:37:07.169
I'm fine.

00:37:07.450 --> 00:37:09.089
But that phoenix symbol...

00:37:09.089 --> 00:37:10.290
What was that?

00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:11.970
When Lin Hu and I heard noises,

00:37:12.089 --> 00:37:13.089
we came to find you.

00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:14.770
Then we saw

00:37:15.049 --> 00:37:16.330
that phoenix symbol

00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:17.370
creating a barrier

00:37:17.770 --> 00:37:18.930
to stop your advancement.

00:37:20.649 --> 00:37:21.649
What?

00:37:21.850 --> 00:37:23.810
Then it turned into a phoenix
and attacked me.

00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:25.490
But why would it

00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:26.850
prevent

00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:28.410
my tribulation breakthroughs?

00:37:30.609 --> 00:37:31.649
I think

00:37:32.049 --> 00:37:33.169
it means to suppress

00:37:33.169 --> 00:37:35.010
your hidden power from surfacing

00:37:35.209 --> 00:37:37.249
in case someone dangerous noticed.

00:37:37.890 --> 00:37:39.410
You mean

00:37:39.569 --> 00:37:41.850
it's actually protecting me?

00:37:42.209 --> 00:37:43.290
Do you remember

00:37:43.529 --> 00:37:44.249
when you stood

00:37:44.249 --> 00:37:45.330
in front of me,

00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:47.010
the attack ceased?

00:37:47.569 --> 00:37:48.410
So,

00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:49.609
where did it come from?

00:37:50.049 --> 00:37:51.209
I'm not sure either.

00:37:51.689 --> 00:37:53.049
But I heard

00:37:53.330 --> 00:37:55.410
those bearing dragon or phoenix seals

00:37:55.609 --> 00:37:56.529
harbor power

00:37:56.850 --> 00:37:57.609
way beyond

00:37:57.609 --> 00:37:59.089
ordinary cultivators.

00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:00.529
Could I

00:38:00.529 --> 00:38:01.249
be someone,

00:38:01.249 --> 00:38:03.089
like in those storybooks,

00:38:03.169 --> 00:38:03.810
who's born

00:38:04.450 --> 00:38:06.490
with a phoenix destiny?

00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:08.290
Is that why I could wield

00:38:08.290 --> 00:38:09.410
the phoenix-headed konghou?

00:38:09.609 --> 00:38:11.729
But in those stories,

00:38:12.010 --> 00:38:13.290
people with a phoenix fate

00:38:13.450 --> 00:38:15.249
always have tragic backgrounds

00:38:15.970 --> 00:38:17.529
and miserable lives.

00:38:19.370 --> 00:38:20.410
You could also look at it

00:38:20.410 --> 00:38:21.689
from the positive side.

00:38:21.689 --> 00:38:22.770
But...

00:38:23.609 --> 00:38:26.049
Having a phoenix mark

00:38:26.810 --> 00:38:27.569
is

00:38:27.689 --> 00:38:29.729
super rare!

00:38:30.370 --> 00:38:31.450
What does this mean?

00:38:31.890 --> 00:38:32.850
It means

00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:34.649
I'm the chosen one!

00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:36.169
All those legendary heroes

00:38:36.169 --> 00:38:37.290
and heroines in the books

00:38:37.290 --> 00:38:38.970
suffer through trials

00:38:38.970 --> 00:38:39.890
before they can achieve

00:38:39.890 --> 00:38:40.810
something great.

00:38:40.850 --> 00:38:41.609
Therefore,

00:38:41.609 --> 00:38:43.609
failing the tribulation this time

00:38:43.609 --> 00:38:44.450
may be

00:38:44.450 --> 00:38:46.209
Heaven testing me!

00:38:51.729 --> 00:38:53.330
Huan Zong, why are you laughing?

00:38:53.330 --> 00:38:54.689
I'm completely serious.

00:38:54.930 --> 00:38:56.169
My Master

00:38:56.209 --> 00:38:57.169
once told me

00:38:57.370 --> 00:38:59.810
I'd achieve greatness later in life.

00:38:59.890 --> 00:39:00.569
In the past,

00:39:00.569 --> 00:39:01.490
I always thought

00:39:01.490 --> 00:39:02.810
he was just comforting me.

00:39:02.890 --> 00:39:04.089
But it turns out he was right!

00:39:06.209 --> 00:39:07.689
Putting it that way,

00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:09.410
Master Wang Tong truly has

00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:11.129
remarkable foresight.

00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:12.689
Of course!
