00:32:02.609 --> 00:32:06.529
So, there are guys following this woman
and tracking everything she's doing?

00:32:07.447 --> 00:32:08.782
[Taejoong] Yeah, I think so.

So, then, how are we supposed to find
the people who are following her?

here's everything.

for all this stuff.

I can use this stuff

Right. Park Taejoong. This is my daughter.

-Whatever.

No, I... Your dad was helping me.

to collect the rent.

-Me?

00:38:40.590 --> 00:38:42.133
No, of... of course not.

00:38:42.216 --> 00:38:44.844
Right. Did she ask for money?

00:38:45.887 --> 00:38:48.222
-Yeah.
-How much?

00:38:50.892 --> 00:38:53.061

00:38:54.103 --> 00:38:56.564
two hundred fifty a week.

Two hundred fifty thou...
[croaks speechlessly]

She's a nice kid, I swear.

00:39:04.322 --> 00:39:07.992
I haven't been a great dad.
She has a good heart, but... [sighs]

00:39:08.076 --> 00:39:09.661
[softly] More like a shitty heart.

00:39:09.744 --> 00:39:11.287

-What?

00:39:11.371 --> 00:39:13.331

00:39:15.541 --> 00:39:16.876

Doesn't he look familiar?

00:40:03.715 --> 00:40:08.553

but I can't be sure because it's blurry.

00:40:08.636 --> 00:40:11.222
[chuckles] Is that right?

00:40:11.848 --> 00:40:15.059
I knew exactly who it was.
Can you really not tell?

[clears throat]

00:40:19.772 --> 00:40:22.150
So, what's the plan now?

00:40:23.151 --> 00:40:26.029
Well, it seems he was close
with a guy who's been released.

00:40:26.571 --> 00:40:28.072
Noh? Noh Yongsik?

00:40:28.698 --> 00:40:30.116
Let's pay him a visit.

00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:33.661

00:40:39.125 --> 00:40:40.877
Did you stay up all night?

00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:45.006
[wearily] I managed to get
a little rest earlier.

00:40:45.089 --> 00:40:51.137
[sighs] Taejoong, your body
isn't fully recovered yet.

00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:53.014
Don't push yourself too hard.

00:40:53.097 --> 00:40:56.392
-Don't worry. I feel okay.
-You need rest.

00:40:58.394 --> 00:41:00.271
Where do we even begin?

00:41:00.354 --> 00:41:02.857
How are we supposed to figure out
who the bad guys are

00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:05.985
-when there's so many people?
-[Taejoong] I think I've found them.

00:41:06.069 --> 00:41:07.528
[♪ suspenseful music playing]

00:41:07.612 --> 00:41:09.155
-You did?
-Yeah.

00:41:10.698 --> 00:41:12.867
I caught something interesting
on the cameras.

00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:13.951
[Yongsik] What?

00:41:15.244 --> 00:41:16.412
-You see this?
-Yeah.

00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:20.666
Over here. This person, and this car.

00:41:21.709 --> 00:41:25.004
Every time that So Hyeonjung
showed up on the cameras, so did they,

00:41:25.088 --> 00:41:26.547
and they all left when she did.

00:41:27.507 --> 00:41:30.718
So these people are definitely
the ones behind this?

00:41:30.802 --> 00:41:36.182
[sighs] We're slowly figuring this out,
but I still don't understand something.

00:41:37.350 --> 00:41:38.351
And what's that?

00:41:40.353 --> 00:41:42.855
-The victim's phone.
-What about it?

00:41:42.939 --> 00:41:45.441
I never had the phone
until I found it that night,

00:41:45.525 --> 00:41:48.528
so how did the data show
that I had it longer than that?

00:41:48.611 --> 00:41:50.905
It perfectly matched
your movements, right?

00:41:50.988 --> 00:41:52.865
It's like it followed you around.

00:41:54.492 --> 00:41:55.493
What?

-You're brilliant.
-Why?

00:41:57.662 --> 00:41:58.663
Look.

00:41:59.539 --> 00:42:01.749
See this? Here.

00:42:03.126 --> 00:42:05.253
[Yongsik] Oh. Is that So Hyeonjung there?

00:42:05.336 --> 00:42:07.505
Yeah. See this motorcycle?

00:42:08.172 --> 00:42:10.466
Looks like someone was
following her constantly.

00:42:11.425 --> 00:42:14.303
They probably did
the exact same thing to you, right?

00:42:15.555 --> 00:42:17.682
I have to get to her before it's too late.

00:42:23.771 --> 00:42:24.981
[exhales heavily]

00:42:38.828 --> 00:42:40.371
[♪ foreboding music playing]

00:43:18.784 --> 00:43:20.661
All we have to do is swap those out.

00:43:21.412 --> 00:43:22.413
Last piece.

00:43:23.831 --> 00:43:25.791

00:43:31.589 --> 00:43:33.758
Mobile Phone Unknown Caller

00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:48.689
Good afternoon, sir.

00:43:50.733 --> 00:43:54.904
-Where's your mom? Is she here?
-No, but she should be coming back soon.

00:43:54.987 --> 00:43:56.030
From where?

00:43:58.199 --> 00:43:59.533
Your mom, where did she go?

00:44:00.243 --> 00:44:03.120
Some lady forgot her cell phone here,
so she's taking it to her.

00:44:03.204 --> 00:44:04.205
Some...

00:44:04.914 --> 00:44:05.957
[exhales heavily]

00:44:07.583 --> 00:44:09.543
You can wait here, if you want.

00:44:10.127 --> 00:44:13.381
Well, actually, did your mom tell you
where she was going?

00:44:16.801 --> 00:44:18.302
Seju Shopping Center
Parking Lot

00:44:18.386 --> 00:44:20.763
Oh. Saeju shopping center parking lot.

00:44:22.848 --> 00:44:24.517
[♪ tense music playing]

00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:26.060
[line ringing]

00:44:26.894 --> 00:44:28.020
[Seoyun] Hello?

00:44:29.355 --> 00:44:31.691
-Who is this?
-[sighs] Shit.

00:44:31.774 --> 00:44:33.985
[Seoyun] I'm sorry, but my mom will be--

00:44:36.070 --> 00:44:37.071
[engine revs]

00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:45.746
[groans] Oh, no. Well, that's not good.

00:44:45.830 --> 00:44:48.207
-[banging on door]
-Coming.

00:44:50.918 --> 00:44:52.920
-Oh, Officer.
-[Cheolhwan] How have you been?

00:44:53.004 --> 00:44:54.297
Coming through. Move.

00:44:55.339 --> 00:44:57.508
-Uh, hey...
-What's that smell?

00:44:57.591 --> 00:44:59.093
Can I help you with something?

00:45:02.471 --> 00:45:05.391
[♪ suspenseful music playing]

00:45:05.474 --> 00:45:09.103
Yes. Yes, I'm getting off the bus now.

00:45:10.938 --> 00:45:11.939
Are you here?

00:45:13.941 --> 00:45:16.902
Do I walk over?
No, it's okay. It's not an issue.

00:45:16.986 --> 00:45:20.031
I can go over to you. Stay there.
Okay, got it.

00:45:21.532 --> 00:45:22.533
See you then.

00:45:30.458 --> 00:45:33.377
[Hwang] You know Park Taejoong, right?
I heard you were close.

00:45:34.045 --> 00:45:36.047
Have you had any contact
with him recently?

00:45:41.844 --> 00:45:44.263
You don't look surprised
that I'm bringing him up.

00:45:44.347 --> 00:45:45.806
Something you want to tell me?

00:45:47.767 --> 00:45:50.478
[woman] Miss? Excuse me. Hello.

00:45:51.854 --> 00:45:53.522
-Oh, is the phone yours?
-It is.

00:45:53.606 --> 00:45:55.900
[claps hands] Whenever I'm talking,

00:45:58.444 --> 00:45:59.820
you better look at me.

00:46:06.202 --> 00:46:09.163
