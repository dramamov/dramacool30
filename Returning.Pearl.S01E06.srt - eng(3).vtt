WEBVTT

00:01:10.722 --> 00:01:13.840
(Returning Pearl)

00:01:13.989 --> 00:01:16.124
Assassin!

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:19.188
She's not the real princess!

00:01:19.268 --> 00:01:23.565
- Here it comes, the iconic scene of "My Fair Princess"! - Stop her!

00:01:23.646 --> 00:01:24.909
- What are you doing? - Zi Wei!

00:01:24.989 --> 00:01:26.742
Yes! It's Zi Wei!

00:01:27.668 --> 00:01:29.653
Er Kang, there seems to be some disturbance at the rear.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.000
Go check it out.

00:01:31.093 --> 00:01:33.032
I'll hold things here. This could be a diversion.

00:01:33.113 --> 00:01:34.113
Alright.

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:36.893
Let go of me!

00:01:37.032 --> 00:01:40.764
Xiao Yan Zi, if you're the princess, then who am I?

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.655
Who am I?

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.713
Beat her up!

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.216
Your Majesty...

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.015
Your Majesty...

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:11.922
Your Majesty...

00:02:16.029 --> 00:02:17.269
Your Majesty...

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.508
Er Kang! Er Kang, turn around!

00:02:19.588 --> 00:02:21.829
That's Zi Wei! Your Zi Wei!

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.958
Turn around and look at her!

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.455
Your Majesty!

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.302
Stop! Stop it!

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:39.028
She's just a defenseless girl.

00:02:39.108 --> 00:02:40.684
Won't you at least hear her out?

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:42.484
Is this any way to treat someone?

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.656
Looks like you're in this together.

00:02:44.801 --> 00:02:45.914
Keep hitting her!

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.793
Come on!

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:06.308
Let go of me! Go away!

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.080
Why did you act so recklessly?

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:18.342
My lord...

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.056
Are you alright?

00:03:59.682 --> 00:04:02.524
(Key plot point achieved. New character unlocked.)

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.553
You're awake.

00:04:21.248 --> 00:04:22.425
Where is that girl?

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.045
Where is she?

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:26.342
Have some water first.

00:04:30.567 --> 00:04:32.264
That girl has been taken away by Lord Fu.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.073
You, on the other hand,

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.697
you risked your life to save her.

00:04:36.128 --> 00:04:37.623
What is your connection to her?

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.673
She...

00:04:41.429 --> 00:04:43.124
She's my childhood friend.

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:45.165
Childhood friend?

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.153
After all these years apart,

00:04:48.587 --> 00:04:49.700
how can you be so sure?

00:04:51.869 --> 00:04:53.884
While that girl may seem vulnerable,

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.179
how could you be sure she wasn't working with others?

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.136
Causing a commotion here as a distraction,

00:04:58.601 --> 00:05:00.353
while her accomplices tried to attack the princess?

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:01.753
No, she wouldn't.

00:05:02.048 --> 00:05:03.161
I trust her.

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.616
She's still the same Zi Wei I knew.

00:05:07.708 --> 00:05:08.924
Gentle on the outside,

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:11.285
but brave at heart.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.273
Seeing her again,

00:05:15.088 --> 00:05:16.785
she's even braver than before.

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:20.782
You look

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.457
different today.

00:05:29.668 --> 00:05:30.964
What was I like before?

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.655
You were selfish.

00:05:35.095 --> 00:05:36.230
Always lying.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.096
You also look different today.

00:05:42.322 --> 00:05:43.435
How so?

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.975
I never thought the Living King of Hell from the Department of Punishments

00:05:47.415 --> 00:05:49.751
had a heart for playing the hero.

00:05:52.788 --> 00:05:55.302
Thank you, Lord Jing.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.473
You're welcome.

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:04.762
Lin Er, come here!

00:06:06.228 --> 00:06:09.965
Is it true you saved a girl from the common folk today?

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.725
That wasn't me, it was Lord Fu who saved her.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.295
Tell me, what did she look like?

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.760
She's as lovely as a painting,

00:06:19.876 --> 00:06:21.251
but she's braver than she looks.

00:06:21.774 --> 00:06:22.887
Oh, right,

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.337
she told me

00:06:25.109 --> 00:06:26.364
her name was Zi Wei.

00:06:28.348 --> 00:06:29.461
It really is Zi Wei!

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:31.953
She's actually...

00:06:32.895 --> 00:06:34.008
I can't tell you!

00:06:36.588 --> 00:06:38.789
Lin Er, since she's staying with Lord Fu now,

00:06:38.869 --> 00:06:41.324
how can I meet her?

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.233
Xiao Yan Zi,

00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:46.148
if she can't come into the palace,

00:06:46.281 --> 00:06:47.617
you can go out to see her.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.577
But leaving the palace isn't easy.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.429
Come on, you're Xiao Yan Zi!

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:54.639
With your skills,

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.989
hopping over a wall or two should be a piece of cake!

00:06:57.109 --> 00:06:58.284
That's true!

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.640
(The Art of War)

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.856
What is this thing called love...

00:07:24.348 --> 00:07:27.444
That it makes one pledge life itself?

00:07:44.521 --> 00:07:45.634
You're writing

00:07:46.715 --> 00:07:47.828
my name?

00:07:48.028 --> 00:07:49.645
But what does it mean?

00:07:50.749 --> 00:07:52.684
Year after year of safety.

00:07:53.869 --> 00:07:54.919
Year after year of safety?

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.256
They're simplified characters.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.713
Simplified characters?

00:07:58.760 --> 00:07:59.873
Anyway,

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.940
you really do need to practice your handwriting.

00:08:03.066 --> 00:08:05.645
Your writing and the Princess's are

00:08:06.073 --> 00:08:07.833
equally atrocious.

00:08:08.824 --> 00:08:09.959
What do you know?

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.199
This is a To-sign.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.759
Do you have any idea how many people want

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.559
an exclusive signature from a big star like me?

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.439
- Talking nonsense again. - You have the nerve to call it ugly!

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.993
Forget it. I'm not writing anymore. I'm not giving it to you.

00:08:19.155 --> 00:08:20.268
Alright, alright.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.566
If your writing's bad, then practice more.

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.040
Hard work makes up for lack of talent.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.810
Tell me what you want to write.

00:08:30.269 --> 00:08:31.382
I'll teach you.

00:08:33.142 --> 00:08:35.118
I want to write...

00:08:39.529 --> 00:08:43.505
What is this thing called love...

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.417
Got him flustered, didn't I?

00:08:49.095 --> 00:08:50.208
What's wrong?

00:08:50.935 --> 00:08:53.232
Lord Jing, don't tell me you don't know this poem?

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:55.553
That's not difficult.

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.097
Tell me the strokes of your simplified characters.

00:09:25.155 --> 00:09:26.451
I will write them for you.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.313
The first stroke

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.457
is a dot.

00:10:13.348 --> 00:10:14.461
Focus.

00:10:31.108 --> 00:10:32.765
It's so stuffy in here.

00:10:34.348 --> 00:10:35.885
I need some fresh air.

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:51.480
(What is this thing called love, that it makes one pledge life itself?)

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:15.999
Xiao Yan Zi just left.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.794
I need to keep an eye on that Living King of Hell.

00:11:17.875 --> 00:11:20.452
Can't let him ruin the crucial reunion between the sisters.

00:11:22.029 --> 00:11:23.109
Weird.

00:11:23.408 --> 00:11:24.903
Why is nobody here?

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.482
Oh no. Has our plan been exposed?

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.586
Sneaking into my room in the dead of night,

00:11:40.047 --> 00:11:41.160
what are you plotting?

00:11:43.669 --> 00:11:46.165
What could I possibly be plotting?

00:11:46.536 --> 00:11:48.432
How can a woman like you behave so shamelessly?

00:11:48.681 --> 00:11:50.599
I need to buy Xiao Yan Zi more time.

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:53.204
What's a big man like you so shy about?

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:56.040
Let me have one look, it's not like you'll suffer any losses.

00:11:56.122 --> 00:11:57.235
Just one look!

00:11:58.228 --> 00:12:00.101
Let go. Let go!

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:04.136
How is this robe so easy to tear?

00:12:06.029 --> 00:12:08.508
Well, the plot is progressing very conveniently.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:09.857
I like it.

00:12:10.242 --> 00:12:11.319
Don't go too far!

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:13.376
Her Majesty has arrived!

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:22.913
I'm doomed.
