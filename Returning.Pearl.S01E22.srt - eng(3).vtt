WEBVTT

00:01:14.094 --> 00:01:14.875
superior

00:02:13.564 --> 00:02:15.600
One of you is the emperor’s favorite brother

00:02:17.202 --> 00:02:19.237
One is the most valued minister of the emperor

00:02:22.884 --> 00:02:24.164
for so called love

00:02:25.845 --> 00:02:27.418
For two folk women

00:02:29.743 --> 00:02:31.224
To sacrifice everything

00:02:33.226 --> 00:02:34.747
Is it really worth it?

00:02:40.276 --> 00:02:41.143
For the little swallow

00:02:41.523 --> 00:02:42.987
I can give up my identity as elder brother

00:02:43.376 --> 00:02:44.221
for me

00:02:44.641 --> 00:02:46.484
Nothing in this world is as precious as crape myrtle

00:02:53.507 --> 00:02:55.550
But what if this world is all fake?

00:02:58.775 --> 00:02:59.843
manly man

00:03:00.426 --> 00:03:02.027
Act with a clear conscience

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:03.749
No matter what happens in this world

00:03:03.774 --> 00:03:04.774
Just a dream

00:03:05.583 --> 00:03:07.103
I also have to listen to my heart

00:03:08.755 --> 00:03:10.439
You have been bullied in the palace since childhood

00:03:10.768 --> 00:03:12.306
My fifth elder brother and I came to help

00:03:12.471 --> 00:03:13.675
Nothing else to do

00:03:14.451 --> 00:03:15.690
Just follow your heart

00:03:17.986 --> 00:03:19.327
Just from the heart

00:03:19.977 --> 00:03:21.231
So what I'm doing right now

00:03:21.797 --> 00:03:23.797
After all, he accepted the fate of fooling people.

00:03:24.583 --> 00:03:26.443
Still listened to my heart

00:03:33.025 --> 00:03:33.915
I

00:03:34.332 --> 00:03:36.875
On your little face first

00:03:36.928 --> 00:03:38.187
hot flower

00:03:38.875 --> 00:03:39.624
if

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.471
You still refuse to sign

00:03:42.878 --> 00:03:44.443
I'll take your meat

00:03:44.627 --> 00:03:46.437
piece by piece

00:03:46.602 --> 00:03:47.602
Blanched

00:03:48.602 --> 00:03:49.459
Lin'er

00:03:52.428 --> 00:03:52.788
don't want

00:03:52.788 --> 00:03:53.256
Lin'er

00:03:53.668 --> 00:03:54.027
don't want

00:03:54.027 --> 00:03:54.603
open

00:03:54.744 --> 00:03:56.025
Don't want Lin'er

00:03:56.307 --> 00:03:56.984
Help

00:04:07.668 --> 00:04:08.465
Hurry up and get out of here

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:09.268
crape myrtle

00:04:09.293 --> 00:04:10.009
little swallow

00:04:11.434 --> 00:04:12.812
Is Ziwei okay?

00:04:13.944 --> 00:04:15.681
Why did you come?

00:04:15.975 --> 00:04:16.588
If you don't come again

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:18.306
That dog officer used a soldering iron

00:04:18.331 --> 00:04:20.295
Branded us into pieces.

00:04:23.028 --> 00:04:25.067
The emperor didn't even convict them.

00:04:26.315 --> 00:04:28.493
How dare you abuse lynching

00:04:28.814 --> 00:04:30.200
You are so brave

00:04:30.596 --> 00:04:31.306
Adult Kei

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:32.925
You know best

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:33.815
If there is no punishment

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.987
Where does the truth come from?

00:04:35.058 --> 00:04:36.097
The lower official is also of the same mind

00:04:36.122 --> 00:04:37.671
I want to find out the truth

00:04:37.708 --> 00:04:39.600
Do you want the truth?

00:04:39.737 --> 00:04:41.784
Still have to give in and make a move

00:04:41.868 --> 00:04:43.186
Lord Jing and Xiaguan

00:04:43.268 --> 00:04:44.862
Under the orders of the Queen and the Empress

00:04:45.056 --> 00:04:46.765
Investigate the case thoroughly

00:04:47.685 --> 00:04:49.765
Could it be that Mr. Jing wants to do this for Lin'er?

00:04:51.282 --> 00:04:52.881
Betrayal of the Queen

00:05:02.332 --> 00:05:03.115
Let's go first

00:05:06.179 --> 00:05:06.931
Come to Lin'er

00:05:10.867 --> 00:05:11.662
oh

00:05:58.814 --> 00:05:59.414
Liu Hong

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:00.837
Little Swallow Crape Myrtle

00:06:01.108 --> 00:06:02.188
What's wrong with you guys?

00:06:02.213 --> 00:06:03.543
Don’t ask Liu Hong yet.

00:06:03.983 --> 00:06:05.223
This is Liu Qing, Liu Hong

00:06:05.561 --> 00:06:07.042
They are all my good friends who have passed away.

00:06:07.175 --> 00:06:08.489
The courtyard is relatively hidden

00:06:08.722 --> 00:06:09.943
Let's take shelter here

00:06:09.968 --> 00:06:10.490
good

00:06:10.706 --> 00:06:11.588
Come on, come on, let's go in first

00:06:11.793 --> 00:06:12.481
Let’s talk after we go in

00:06:12.881 --> 00:06:13.425
quick

00:06:21.137 --> 00:06:22.087
Liu Hong

00:06:22.462 --> 00:06:24.262
These are our good sisters in the palace

00:06:24.507 --> 00:06:25.465
Called Lin'er

00:06:33.937 --> 00:06:35.356
Why are you so cruel?

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:36.748
Lin'er

00:06:36.898 --> 00:06:37.809
You have to be patient

00:06:38.198 --> 00:06:39.700
You'll get better quickly if you take medicine

00:06:53.203 --> 00:06:54.025
Lin'er

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.480
If you are in pain

00:06:56.257 --> 00:06:57.737
Just shout it out loud

00:07:01.423 --> 00:07:02.502
Not that exaggerated

00:07:02.947 --> 00:07:03.947
Sister Liu Hong

00:07:04.516 --> 00:07:05.522
You can come

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:07.029
good girl

00:07:20.176 --> 00:07:20.893
Lin'er Lin'er

00:07:21.954 --> 00:07:22.765
Lin'er

00:07:27.152 --> 00:07:28.625
Lin'er was injured the most

00:07:29.548 --> 00:07:31.627
They blocked us a lot of whips at that time

00:07:32.858 --> 00:07:33.647
fine

00:07:34.088 --> 00:07:34.962
crape myrtle

00:07:35.074 --> 00:07:35.975
It's fine

00:07:36.342 --> 00:07:37.159
Lin'er

00:07:37.757 --> 00:07:39.228
If you are in pain

00:07:39.253 --> 00:07:40.428
Just hold on to me

00:07:40.662 --> 00:07:41.503
Hold on to me

00:07:42.311 --> 00:07:43.018
Um

00:07:43.815 --> 00:07:44.481
Lin'er

00:07:44.506 --> 00:07:45.222
Bear with me any longer

00:07:45.247 --> 00:07:46.162
good

00:07:53.721 --> 00:07:54.508
Lin'er

00:07:59.108 --> 00:08:00.108
It's fine

00:08:00.507 --> 00:08:01.588
I'm fine

00:08:13.858 --> 00:08:15.653
I'm really going to starve to death

00:08:15.678 --> 00:08:17.193
Okay, okay, come right away

00:08:17.348 --> 00:08:18.493
Liu Qing went to get it

00:08:18.668 --> 00:08:19.484
Where is it?

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:20.999
Liu Qing

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:25.267
Let me see

00:08:38.355 --> 00:08:39.355
It will hurt a little

00:08:46.225 --> 00:08:47.225
Hold on a little longer

00:08:58.508 --> 00:08:59.065
Come

00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:00.068
Hurry up and have something to eat

00:09:01.235 --> 00:09:02.024
Don't worry, everyone

00:09:02.365 --> 00:09:03.603
It's absolutely safe here

00:09:03.628 --> 00:09:04.540
No one will come

00:09:04.988 --> 00:09:07.878
Let's all settle down here to avoid the limelight.

00:09:10.395 --> 00:09:11.002
eat slowly

00:09:11.031 --> 00:09:12.087
I'm starving

00:09:12.112 --> 00:09:12.965
well

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:14.218
Eat slowly and don't choke.

00:09:17.907 --> 00:09:19.231
My mother always says

00:09:19.724 --> 00:09:21.125
The king's heart is unpredictable

00:09:22.752 --> 00:09:23.872
I didn't understand before

00:09:26.147 --> 00:09:27.387
now i understand

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:30.260
My heart hurts so much

00:09:34.296 --> 00:09:35.337
Not just us

00:09:35.912 --> 00:09:37.662
Even your concubine was implicated

00:09:51.493 --> 00:09:53.333
Slow down, no one will compete with you

00:09:56.171 --> 00:09:57.171
Are you choking?

00:10:02.516 --> 00:10:03.615
What's wrong, everyone?

00:10:04.459 --> 00:10:05.678
Then he is the emperor

00:10:05.706 --> 00:10:07.662
Aren’t all the emperors in the world like this?

00:10:07.856 --> 00:10:10.095
Investigate other people’s affairs to the end

00:10:10.147 --> 00:10:11.678
about one's own affairs

00:10:11.703 --> 00:10:15.131
Then you won't blame yourself

00:10:15.913 --> 00:10:16.559
right?

00:10:17.635 --> 00:10:19.153
I finally understand

00:10:19.208 --> 00:10:20.950
Huang Ama doesn’t care about us at all

00:10:22.243 --> 00:10:23.323
He is happy

00:10:23.348 --> 00:10:24.303
Like ten

00:10:24.328 --> 00:10:25.412
Nine likes and eight likes

00:10:25.787 --> 00:10:26.825
He is unhappy

00:10:26.867 --> 00:10:28.068
Kick us away

00:10:28.263 --> 00:10:29.556
Regardless of our life or death

00:10:30.929 --> 00:10:32.210
Anyway, this ruined palace

00:10:32.684 --> 00:10:34.084
I can't stay any longer

00:10:34.131 --> 00:10:35.131
Xiao Yanzi is right

00:10:35.559 --> 00:10:37.081
Although there is glory and wealth in the palace,

00:10:37.525 --> 00:10:38.731
But it’s not as good as a large courtyard

00:10:39.188 --> 00:10:40.068
At least here

00:10:40.069 --> 00:10:41.209
We all live a solid life

00:10:41.507 --> 00:10:41.968
Um

00:10:41.993 --> 00:10:43.256
Not a little swallow

00:10:43.357 --> 00:10:44.350
One code to one code

00:10:44.934 --> 00:10:47.112
I will definitely go back when I go back

00:10:47.137 --> 00:10:48.650
That Ziwei is Princess?

00:10:48.841 --> 00:10:50.881
She must return to her original position.

00:10:51.675 --> 00:10:52.387
After this experience

00:10:52.387 --> 00:10:53.387
I figured it out too

00:10:53.706 --> 00:10:55.653
Identity can be taken away at any time

00:10:55.775 --> 00:10:57.353
But real feelings don't

00:10:57.907 --> 00:10:58.946
I'm just like a little swallow

00:10:58.988 --> 00:10:59.953
I won't go back either

00:10:59.978 --> 00:11:00.419
no no no

00:11:00.444 --> 00:11:00.883
good

00:11:00.908 --> 00:11:01.990
Little Swallow Crape Myrtle

00:11:02.015 --> 00:11:03.484
Don't be anxious, both of you.

00:11:03.509 --> 00:11:05.368
Can you give the emperor some time?

00:11:05.393 --> 00:11:06.522
Give him some time

00:11:06.547 --> 00:11:07.775
He naturally figured it out

00:11:07.803 --> 00:11:09.282
He is your emperor, Lin'er

00:11:09.307 --> 00:11:09.956
Lin'er

00:11:10.468 --> 00:11:12.706
Look how injured you are

00:11:12.731 --> 00:11:14.628
Why do you keep urging us to go back to the palace?

00:11:14.705 --> 00:11:15.705
Yes, Lin'er

00:11:16.279 --> 00:11:17.437
Jingyuan is for you

00:11:17.571 --> 00:11:18.900
Carrying the felony of prison robbery

00:11:19.223 --> 00:11:20.582
Why would you want to go back?

00:11:21.802 --> 00:11:22.687
I

00:11:23.159 --> 00:11:23.853
every year

00:11:25.819 --> 00:11:27.459
It doesn't work out every time

00:11:29.804 --> 00:11:31.245
Do you still want to keep hiding it?

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:37.046
what do you mean

00:11:37.646 --> 00:11:38.878
What is Lin'er hiding?

00:11:45.542 --> 00:11:47.012
No matter what I hide over the years

00:11:47.336 --> 00:11:48.178
i believe

00:11:48.728 --> 00:11:50.247
She must have her own reasons

00:11:50.999 --> 00:11:51.578
Um

00:11:56.123 --> 00:11:57.123
They are now

00:11:57.148 --> 00:11:58.859
They all treat you as a true friend

00:11:59.214 --> 00:12:00.414
if you really care about them

00:12:00.439 --> 00:12:01.384
Just tell the truth

00:12:01.409 --> 00:12:03.571
Stop treating everyone like pawns, okay?

00:12:10.047 --> 00:12:11.374
It's okay, Lin'er

00:12:11.512 --> 00:12:13.375
Did you encounter any difficulties?

00:12:13.632 --> 00:12:15.040
If you encounter any problems

00:12:15.065 --> 00:12:16.109
Just tell us

00:12:16.134 --> 00:12:17.452
Let's all figure it out together

00:12:17.477 --> 00:12:18.557
Let's help you solve it together

00:12:20.519 --> 00:12:21.639
Xiao Yanzi is right

00:12:22.045 --> 00:12:24.000
You see we have so many friends together

00:12:24.288 --> 00:12:26.159
I'm sure you can think of a way to solve the problem.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:27.372
Um

00:12:30.538 --> 00:12:32.109
Little Swallow Crape Myrtle

00:12:32.515 --> 00:12:33.568
They are so good

00:12:34.014 --> 00:12:35.828
Live so vividly and bravely

00:12:36.808 --> 00:12:38.668
It’s not that I don’t have any thoughts at all

00:12:38.696 --> 00:12:40.159
Paper person without emotions

00:12:44.137 --> 00:12:45.137
Lin'er

00:12:45.267 --> 00:12:45.981
All right

00:12:53.475 --> 00:12:55.040
Will you really believe me?

00:12:55.594 --> 00:12:56.035
Um

00:12:56.376 --> 00:12:57.222
Um

00:12:57.635 --> 00:12:58.218
Um

00:13:01.086 --> 00:13:01.847
good

00:13:03.462 --> 00:13:04.331
I said

00:13:07.794 --> 00:13:08.794
actually

00:13:18.866 --> 00:13:20.706
In fact, I am not from this world

00:13:23.749 --> 00:13:24.831
this world

00:13:27.807 --> 00:13:28.967
Not real either

00:13:50.016 --> 00:13:50.824
Wow

00:13:51.854 --> 00:13:53.381
Turns out I'm so powerful

00:13:53.601 --> 00:13:55.637
I am the protagonist in the storybook

00:13:56.721 --> 00:13:57.721
yes yes yes

00:13:57.948 --> 00:13:58.900
You are the most powerful

00:13:59.232 --> 00:14:00.311
you are the protagonist

00:14:01.308 --> 00:14:02.015
but

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.265
i never thought about it

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:04.934
Our world is actually fake

00:14:04.959 --> 00:14:06.440
And it’s a storybook

00:14:07.207 --> 00:14:08.300
What happened?

00:14:08.624 --> 00:14:11.762
As long as we all live happily

00:14:11.787 --> 00:14:13.296
We are all happy

00:14:13.321 --> 00:14:14.009
Yes or no

00:14:15.428 --> 00:14:16.756
what i feel is real

00:14:16.993 --> 00:14:18.975
This world is real

00:14:19.889 --> 00:14:20.659
you're right

00:14:29.405 --> 00:14:30.993
Zhuang Shengxiao dreams of butterflies

00:14:31.291 --> 00:14:32.530
I don’t know it’s Zhuang Zhou Mengdie

00:14:32.555 --> 00:14:33.555
Still Butterfly Dream Zhuang Zhou

00:14:34.147 --> 00:14:35.472
The world outside this story

00:14:35.731 --> 00:14:37.097
Maybe it's another storybook

00:14:37.826 --> 00:14:39.466
No matter whether this world is true or false

00:14:44.444 --> 00:14:45.100
crape myrtle

00:14:45.611 --> 00:14:46.571
my heart for you

00:14:46.752 --> 00:14:47.571
is alive

00:14:47.952 --> 00:14:48.625
sincerely

00:14:54.089 --> 00:14:56.409
I can meet you and know each other and fall in love with you

00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:58.415
for me

00:14:58.797 --> 00:15:00.187
It's the best world

00:15:09.828 --> 00:15:11.027
Xiao Yanzi is right

00:15:11.973 --> 00:15:13.803
No matter whether this world is a storybook or not

00:15:14.226 --> 00:15:16.218
We all need the company of the world of mortals

00:15:16.243 --> 00:15:17.243
Live a carefree and unrestrained life

00:15:17.645 --> 00:15:18.804
Makes sense

00:15:27.223 --> 00:15:27.881
sorry

00:15:28.948 --> 00:15:30.662
I've been hiding this from everyone for so long

00:15:33.853 --> 00:15:34.853
little swallow

00:15:36.895 --> 00:15:37.709
crape myrtle

00:15:39.965 --> 00:15:42.340
I don't seem to know when it started

00:15:43.484 --> 00:15:46.115
I've truly blended in with you.

00:15:52.747 --> 00:15:53.490
you

00:15:54.629 --> 00:15:56.629
They are all my best best friends

00:16:09.907 --> 00:16:12.147
Okay, my good Lin'er

00:16:12.354 --> 00:16:13.321
It's okay

00:16:14.024 --> 00:16:15.787
oops

00:16:16.199 --> 00:16:17.796
My good Lin'er

00:16:19.491 --> 00:16:20.493
It's okay

00:16:21.397 --> 00:16:22.056
Um

00:16:29.999 --> 00:16:32.137
Then how do you return to your world?

00:16:34.296 --> 00:16:34.959
crape myrtle

00:16:35.106 --> 00:16:36.707
Actually I want to ask you a question

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:38.500
Do you really not remember the golden lock?

00:16:38.907 --> 00:16:39.868
golden lock

00:16:40.916 --> 00:16:42.477
That big golden lock you gave me

00:16:42.553 --> 00:16:43.228
no

00:16:43.414 --> 00:16:44.365
she is a person

00:16:44.627 --> 00:16:46.107
She's your personal maid

00:16:46.108 --> 00:16:47.507
I grew up with you since childhood

00:16:47.715 --> 00:16:49.627
Then I will accompany you to Beijing to recognize your father.

00:16:50.565 --> 00:16:51.893
You really don’t remember her?

00:16:52.524 --> 00:16:53.124
I

00:16:53.369 --> 00:16:55.271
I don't remember such a person at all.

00:16:56.586 --> 00:16:57.318
impossible

00:17:00.988 --> 00:17:03.193
Ziwei was alone when she came to Beijing

00:17:03.347 --> 00:17:04.343
What's around her

00:17:04.388 --> 00:17:05.812
gold lock silver lock

00:17:05.997 --> 00:17:07.112
Nothing

00:17:07.168 --> 00:17:08.693
Lin'er, did you remember it wrong?

00:17:09.777 --> 00:17:11.500
Ziwei can't remember the existence of Jinsuo

00:17:12.112 --> 00:17:14.003
It further shows that there is something wrong with the golden lock
