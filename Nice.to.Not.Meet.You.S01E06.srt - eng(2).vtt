Hey, there aren't enough side dishes.

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:55.619
Stop complaining and serve the rice.

00:00:59.081 --> 00:01:00.082
One bowl?

00:01:00.165 --> 00:01:01.083
Two bowls.

00:01:03.127 --> 00:01:03.961
What the heck?

00:01:04.587 --> 00:01:05.880
The rice isn't cooked.

00:01:05.963 --> 00:01:07.172

Hello, do you still have the rice cooker?

00:01:58.265 --> 00:01:59.141
Yes, I do.

00:01:59.224 --> 00:02:01.101
Can you give me a 30,000 won discount?

00:02:01.185 --> 00:02:02.186
Thirty thousand won?

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.315
Sure, do whatever you want.

00:02:06.398 --> 00:02:07.316
Yes, I can do that.

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.068

00:02:24.625 --> 00:02:26.752
I have a cold, and I keep coughing.

00:02:26.835 --> 00:02:27.920
Hey, where's my handcart?

00:02:28.003 --> 00:02:29.171
It's next to the shoe cabinet.

00:02:34.468 --> 00:02:35.928

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:18.137

00:03:32.151 --> 00:03:32.985
Lim Hyeon-jun?

00:03:33.694 --> 00:03:35.029
Yes, I do.

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.490
It's the first time in my life.

00:03:39.575 --> 00:03:42.453

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.900
-What are you doing?
-I'm checking to see if it's cooking.

00:04:54.983 --> 00:04:56.693
I'm sure it'll cook on its own.

00:04:56.777 --> 00:04:59.279
What if it doesn't work?
I'll have to ask for a refund.

00:05:00.697 --> 00:05:04.243
Your delicious white rice is ready,
cooked on high heat.

00:05:04.326 --> 00:05:06.620
-Please stir the rice carefully.
-Yes, it worked!

00:05:07.663 --> 00:05:08.705
Nice, it works.

00:05:09.331 --> 00:05:10.207

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.753
Does the rice cooker work?

00:05:14.837 --> 00:05:17.172
If it doesn't,
I'll give you a 100% refund.

00:05:19.424 --> 00:05:20.884
Let's see.

00:05:34.606 --> 00:05:36.775
The rice cooker works well.

00:05:36.859 --> 00:05:38.777
Thanks to you,
I got a brand new item at a low price.

00:05:38.861 --> 00:05:39.695
Thank you.

00:05:43.782 --> 00:05:45.033
She already used it?

00:05:47.119 --> 00:05:50.289
I'm actually a fan
of Lim Hyeon-jun myself.

00:05:50.372 --> 00:05:53.167
-Seriously?
-I love Kang Pil-gu.

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.294
Wow, I'm so glad we met!

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:58.547
It was nice meeting you earlier too.

00:05:59.173 --> 00:06:01.466
Kang Pil-gu Season 5 is coming out soon.

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.218
I'm so looking forward to it.
My heart's pounding.

00:06:06.597 --> 00:06:07.973
Her heart's pounding.

00:06:12.936 --> 00:06:15.898
I actually have a friend
who's a crew member for dramas.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.027
Oh, really?

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:23.447
So I have some Kang Pil-gu merch.

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.408
Umbrellas, T-shirts,
portable chargers, and things like that.

00:06:27.075 --> 00:06:29.870
I would've brought some with me
if I'd known you were a fan.

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.206
I can share some with you if you'd like.

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:34.750
Yes, please! Could you…

00:06:36.376 --> 00:06:38.795
Say that you want some.

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:40.505
Oh, that's okay.

00:06:40.589 --> 00:06:42.591
Thank you for offering, though.

00:06:45.052 --> 00:06:47.596
Look at you, trying to act cool.

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:50.849
-Thank you for…
-Thank you for today.

00:06:50.933 --> 00:06:52.226
I hope you have a good night.

00:06:53.352 --> 00:06:56.063
Thank you. You too, Soulishere.

00:06:56.688 --> 00:06:58.815
Have a good night.

00:07:13.789 --> 00:07:14.748
I do want some, though.

00:07:15.457 --> 00:07:16.875
Maybe I should've asked for a few.

00:07:21.755 --> 00:07:23.173
I should leave a review.

00:07:24.967 --> 00:07:26.260
Jeong-sin, dinner's ready!

00:07:26.343 --> 00:07:27.511
Okay!

00:07:29.513 --> 00:07:31.306
"Friendly and has good manners."

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:32.432
"Responds quickly."

00:07:32.516 --> 00:07:33.600
"The product is in good condition."

00:07:33.684 --> 00:07:35.143
"Arrives in a timely manner."

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.697
EPISODE 6

00:07:48.991 --> 00:07:51.785
Now, the star
of Good Detective Kang Pil-gu,

00:07:51.868 --> 00:07:54.121
Mr. Lim Hyeon-jun,
will throw the first pitch!

00:08:03.547 --> 00:08:04.464
Me?

00:08:04.548 --> 00:08:05.424
That's right.

00:08:05.924 --> 00:08:07.342
This is for you.

00:08:28.405 --> 00:08:29.239
Let's have our meeting.

00:08:34.453 --> 00:08:36.163
-Start us off, Ha Seong-min.
-Yes, ma'am.

00:08:36.246 --> 00:08:37.289
Park Jun-woo's fans are saying

00:08:37.372 --> 00:08:40.584
that he's dating Jin Su-a,
based on the photos he's been posting.

00:08:40.667 --> 00:08:41.960
They're barking up the wrong tree.

00:08:42.044 --> 00:08:44.379
Park Jun-woo doesn't date celebrities.
He goes after non-celebrities.

00:08:44.463 --> 00:08:46.840
But didn't his ex move abroad?

00:08:46.923 --> 00:08:49.885
Yes, she set off marriage rumors
but was treated like a stalker.

00:08:49.968 --> 00:08:52.179
She probably felt humiliated,
so she used studying abroad

00:08:52.262 --> 00:08:53.430
as an excuse to leave.

00:08:54.723 --> 00:08:58.101
Why trust what an actor says?
He's amazing at acting.

00:08:58.185 --> 00:09:00.896
Celebrities and non-celebrities
always end in disaster.

00:09:05.942 --> 00:09:08.862
Mr. Hwang,
I know you like my green onion kimchi.

00:09:08.945 --> 00:09:10.989
You made green onion kimchi, Ms. Seong?

00:09:12.032 --> 00:09:13.033
Ta-da!

00:09:13.909 --> 00:09:15.202
-It looks amazing, right?
-It looks so good.

00:09:15.285 --> 00:09:18.246
This is all you need
to make a bowl of rice disappear.

00:09:19.414 --> 00:09:20.457
Mr. Hwang.

00:09:21.083 --> 00:09:24.419
I swear I'll make you
green onion kimchi until you die.

00:09:25.128 --> 00:09:27.506
So help me
land some acting roles, will you?

00:09:28.882 --> 00:09:29.841
Ms. Seong.

00:09:31.051 --> 00:09:32.844
You see, I truly do want to help you,

00:09:32.928 --> 00:09:35.472
-but getting work is--
-Mr. Hwang!

00:09:38.975 --> 00:09:40.977
Ae-suk, what brings you here?

00:09:41.061 --> 00:09:42.396
I could ask you the same.

00:09:42.479 --> 00:09:43.730
This isn't even your agency.

00:09:43.814 --> 00:09:45.732
Why do you think I'm here?

00:09:47.401 --> 00:09:50.028
Mr. Hwang, you should've had
those articles taken down.

00:09:50.112 --> 00:09:51.488
Because of all the articles

00:09:51.571 --> 00:09:54.199
about Hyeon-jun and Ae-suk,
I'm being dragged into the public eye too.

00:09:55.242 --> 00:09:57.411
I'm too embarrassed to look at my sons.

00:09:57.494 --> 00:09:58.703
I'm very sorry, ma'am.

00:09:58.787 --> 00:10:00.831
Why are you apologizing, Mr. Hwang?

00:10:00.914 --> 00:10:04.793
Look, I portray a devoted mother
in the weekend drama I'm acting in.

00:10:04.876 --> 00:10:06.920
But because of you and Hyeon-jun,

00:10:07.003 --> 00:10:10.257
people will look at my face and think,
"It's that erotic film actress."

00:10:10.882 --> 00:10:12.426
An actor's public image is everything.

00:10:13.718 --> 00:10:16.263
It's not like you're being
accused of something you didn't do.

00:10:16.346 --> 00:10:19.766
Why blame us for people gossiping about
you going nude in a movie?

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:21.977
If you didn't want that,
you shouldn't have done it at all!

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:23.937
Are you done talking?

00:10:24.438 --> 00:10:26.314
What do you know
about the life of an actor?

00:10:26.398 --> 00:10:27.232
"Life of an actor"?

00:10:28.108 --> 00:10:31.111
You've got some nerve
talking about the life of an actor!

00:10:31.194 --> 00:10:32.446
Back in the day,
you barely got to play my maid,

00:10:32.529 --> 00:10:35.031
only because
I hooked you up with the role!

00:10:38.702 --> 00:10:39.661
What?

00:10:40.787 --> 00:10:41.872
"Hooked me up"?

00:10:50.505 --> 00:10:51.715
Ma'am!

00:10:52.924 --> 00:10:54.342
You crazy…

00:11:00.098 --> 00:11:01.349
Why, you!

00:11:02.976 --> 00:11:04.102
You crazy…

00:11:04.728 --> 00:11:06.188
Hyeon-jun, let go of me!

00:11:06.271 --> 00:11:10.025
Seriously, Mom?
When did you even get here?

00:11:10.108 --> 00:11:12.527
-You're going to drive me crazy.
-Let me go!

00:11:13.737 --> 00:11:16.740
Why did you come alone?
You should've come with me.

00:11:16.823 --> 00:11:20.452
Mother, you got a lot on your dress.

00:11:20.535 --> 00:11:21.661
Goodness.

00:11:23.872 --> 00:11:24.706
Hello.

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:26.208
Hello.

00:11:27.626 --> 00:11:28.960
Let's go, Mother.

00:11:29.044 --> 00:11:30.003
I'm so upset.

00:11:31.505 --> 00:11:33.298
-Let's go, Mother.
-Wait!

00:11:33.798 --> 00:11:37.093
I'll go, but not before
I clear up the misunderstanding.

00:11:37.177 --> 00:11:38.094
Misunderstanding?

00:11:38.178 --> 00:11:40.430
What misunderstanding?
I saw what happened!

00:11:40.514 --> 00:11:43.475
And what brought you here
in the first place?

00:11:43.558 --> 00:11:46.144
-I'm so embarrassed by you!
-I'm proud of you, Mother.

00:11:46.895 --> 00:11:48.897
So don't be so upset.

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:55.153
Jun, I really want to act again.

00:11:55.737 --> 00:11:58.156
Please ask Mr. Hwang to help me out.

00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:59.574
Let's go.

00:12:00.408 --> 00:12:03.495
But I want to act again!

00:12:06.498 --> 00:12:08.208
-Gwon Se-na?
-Yes.

00:12:08.792 --> 00:12:11.044
Do you know if
Gwon Se-na is seeing anyone?

00:12:11.127 --> 00:12:12.379
Why do you ask?

00:12:12.963 --> 00:12:14.714
I want to spark a dating rumor.

00:12:16.841 --> 00:12:19.219
I did hear that she has a sponsor.

00:12:19.302 --> 00:12:21.429
The chairman you asked questions to…

00:12:21.513 --> 00:12:23.223
It was him.

00:12:23.306 --> 00:12:25.392
That's the man who dated Ms. Gwon Se-na.

00:12:26.059 --> 00:12:28.186
But she's at a level
where she doesn't need a sponsor.

00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:30.939
Who's the guy?

00:12:31.982 --> 00:12:35.068
She's obviously here
because she doesn't know.

00:12:35.151 --> 00:12:36.111
Right.

00:12:36.861 --> 00:12:38.697
I did think it was odd
that her career had just taken off,

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:41.074
yet she bought a unit
in an upscale luxury apartment.

00:12:41.157 --> 00:12:42.993
I heard she was really poor
before her fame.

00:12:44.202 --> 00:12:45.412
Chief.

00:12:46.871 --> 00:12:48.540
Do you think
I could get Ms. Gwon's number?

00:12:54.254 --> 00:12:55.797
-Hello?
-Hello?

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.382
Is this Ms. Gwon Se-na?

00:12:57.966 --> 00:13:00.844
I'm Reporter Wi Jeong-sin
from Sports Eunseong.

00:13:00.927 --> 00:13:04.472
The reason I'm calling
is to request an interview.

00:13:04.556 --> 00:13:06.433
How did you get my number?

00:13:06.516 --> 00:13:09.269
I'm incredibly sorry
for calling so suddenly,

00:13:09.352 --> 00:13:11.354
but I can explain everything
when we meet--

00:13:12.397 --> 00:13:13.857
Hello?

00:13:29.039 --> 00:13:30.665
So? Did she agree to meet with you?

00:13:31.499 --> 00:13:32.334
She hung up on me.

00:13:32.417 --> 00:13:33.501
That's a shame.

00:13:34.169 --> 00:13:35.003
Now what?

00:13:37.297 --> 00:13:38.673
I'll have to make her come to me.

00:13:39.382 --> 00:13:40.925
AUDITION WAITING AREA

00:13:44.804 --> 00:13:45.805
Mr. Wi Hong-sin?

00:13:45.889 --> 00:13:47.474
-Yes?
-Please come in.

00:13:48.058 --> 00:13:48.933
Yes, sir.

00:13:56.232 --> 00:13:58.360
He gets extra points for that.

00:14:06.743 --> 00:14:07.827
Hello!

00:14:07.911 --> 00:14:09.496
My name is Wi Hong-sin.

00:14:09.579 --> 00:14:10.538
It's nice to meet you.

00:14:14.292 --> 00:14:15.919
Mr. Wi Hong-sin?

00:14:16.002 --> 00:14:16.920
Yes, my bro!

00:14:17.921 --> 00:14:19.631
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:14:19.714 --> 00:14:22.717
I feel like I already know you, so…

00:14:24.594 --> 00:14:25.679
I like the friendly vibe.

00:14:26.846 --> 00:14:28.890
Show us what you prepared, little bro.

00:14:28.973 --> 00:14:30.141
Yes, sir.

00:14:31.476 --> 00:14:32.435
Auntie, should I become a cop?

00:14:32.519 --> 00:14:35.313
Do you think anyone can become a cop?

00:14:35.814 --> 00:14:38.191
Are you saying your nephew,
Kang Pil-gu, is just "anyone"?

00:14:38.274 --> 00:14:40.360
That's disappointing.
What if I get into the police academy?

00:14:40.443 --> 00:14:42.570
If you get in, I'll eat my hat.

00:14:44.322 --> 00:14:47.283
I can't let you eat your hat,
so I guess I won't become a cop.

00:14:47.367 --> 00:14:48.326
That's enough.

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:52.038
Your naturalistic acting was good.

00:14:52.122 --> 00:14:55.583
And you look oddly similar to Kang Pil-gu.

00:14:56.793 --> 00:14:57.669
Thank you, sir!

00:14:57.752 --> 00:14:59.295
However…

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:02.799
You changed up the lines.

00:15:02.882 --> 00:15:04.926
Right. I'm sorry.

00:15:05.009 --> 00:15:08.263
I forgot my lines
because I was distracted by your gaze.

00:15:11.266 --> 00:15:14.853
Not knowing the lines for your scene
isn't something to be proud of.

00:15:14.936 --> 00:15:17.605
Then what about
"I can't let you eat your hat,

00:15:17.689 --> 00:15:20.066
so I guess I won't become a cop"?

00:15:20.817 --> 00:15:23.570
I didn't forget those lines.

00:15:23.653 --> 00:15:27.615
I thought if I were Kang Pil-gu,
I'd be more affectionate with my aunt,

00:15:27.699 --> 00:15:29.617
so I changed it up a little in my own way.

00:15:33.079 --> 00:15:36.166
Changing the script to suit yourself

00:15:36.249 --> 00:15:39.586
only works if you have
a solid understanding of the character.

00:15:39.669 --> 00:15:42.839
Relying on your instincts
and improvising on the spot

00:15:43.339 --> 00:15:45.800
is very inconsiderate to the other actors.

00:15:45.884 --> 00:15:46.801
Also,

00:15:48.136 --> 00:15:52.182
how can a newbie actor
have so much confidence in their acting?

00:15:53.725 --> 00:15:55.143
That's bizarre to me.

00:16:08.364 --> 00:16:09.699
Jeez.

00:16:09.783 --> 00:16:12.619
Did you see your mother off?

00:16:12.702 --> 00:16:15.872
Don't even think of helping my mom
if she shows up at your office again.

00:16:16.581 --> 00:16:17.665
All right.

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:21.377
But bro,

00:16:21.461 --> 00:16:24.339
she must really want to act again
to come see me like that.

00:16:24.923 --> 00:16:26.090
I mean, to be honest,

00:16:26.174 --> 00:16:28.927
your mother's acting skills are
much better than yours.

00:16:29.969 --> 00:16:31.221
Are you trying to get me riled up?

00:16:31.304 --> 00:16:33.765
Give me back that car key. Give it back!

00:16:33.848 --> 00:16:36.059
Fine, I got it.

00:16:36.142 --> 00:16:38.686
There's nothing pettier
than taking back a gift, bro.

00:16:41.773 --> 00:16:42.607
Anyway,

00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:45.109
that baseball player was
Ms. Oh Mi-ran's son?

00:16:45.193 --> 00:16:48.238
I know, right? What a small world.

00:16:48.321 --> 00:16:51.741
Man, he's got the family background,
the looks, the skills…

00:16:51.825 --> 00:16:53.117
Did you see how he was?

00:16:53.201 --> 00:16:56.246
How can someone be so sweet to their mom?

00:16:56.329 --> 00:16:58.289
Gosh, he's so perfect.

00:16:58.373 --> 00:17:01.501
Being born to good parents isn't a skill.
It's just luck.

00:17:01.584 --> 00:17:03.837
Right. Of course, it's luck.

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:05.463
It's no skill at all.

00:17:05.547 --> 00:17:06.381
Oh, right.

00:17:06.464 --> 00:17:09.717
That kid you failed
in the audition earlier.

00:17:09.801 --> 00:17:10.969
Do you think he's--

00:17:11.052 --> 00:17:12.887
He's Ms. Wi Jeong-sin's younger brother.

00:17:12.971 --> 00:17:14.389
Wi Jeong-sin. Wi Hong-sin.

00:17:14.973 --> 00:17:18.768
I knew it. I just knew it!

00:17:19.519 --> 00:17:20.687
Hold on.

00:17:22.021 --> 00:17:24.232
-Did you deliberately fail him?
-Don't be ridiculous.

00:17:24.315 --> 00:17:27.193
I was a fair and impartial judge.

00:17:31.823 --> 00:17:32.824
That's a lie.

00:17:33.324 --> 00:17:35.952
You're saying all this will fit inside?
I can't believe it.

00:17:36.035 --> 00:17:37.370
That's a lie.

00:17:38.621 --> 00:17:40.039
Cut! Okay.

00:17:40.123 --> 00:17:41.124
-Nicely done.
-Good job.

00:17:44.127 --> 00:17:45.003
Can you hand me my phone?

00:17:45.795 --> 00:17:47.422
She can't see this article.

00:17:47.922 --> 00:17:50.216
-Ms. Gwon can't see this.
-I know, right?

00:17:52.051 --> 00:17:52.886
What is it?

00:17:53.469 --> 00:17:55.179
GWON SE-NA LIES TO REPORTERS
AT THE AIRPORT

00:17:55.263 --> 00:17:56.389
SUPERSTAR ON A POWER TRIP?

00:17:56.472 --> 00:17:59.392
GWON SE-NA FAILS OVERSEAS,
RETURNS TO KOREA

00:17:59.475 --> 00:18:01.144
GWON SE-NA HUMILIATED,
IS IT HER WIDE SHOULDERS OR HER BIG FACE?

00:18:05.857 --> 00:18:07.650
REPORTER WI JEONG-SIN

00:18:07.734 --> 00:18:10.528
I'm Reporter Wi Jeong-sin
from Sports Eunseong.

00:18:10.612 --> 00:18:14.198
The reason I'm calling
is to request an interview.

00:18:14.282 --> 00:18:15.491
Is she crazy?

00:18:16.242 --> 00:18:17.327
Damn it!

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:23.750
Thank you for meeting me,

00:18:24.792 --> 00:18:26.377
Ms. Wi Jeong-sin.

00:18:27.086 --> 00:18:28.004
Not at all.

00:18:28.713 --> 00:18:31.758
I was surprised
you reached out first, Ms. Gwon.

00:18:31.841 --> 00:18:33.134
It was very unexpected.

00:18:34.594 --> 00:18:38.097
Isn't that precisely why
you published all those articles?

00:18:38.598 --> 00:18:40.141
If that's how you saw it,

00:18:41.351 --> 00:18:42.352
you're very clever.

00:18:49.108 --> 00:18:52.028
What is it that you want to ask me?

00:18:52.111 --> 00:18:53.821
I hear you're seeing
someone rather influential.

00:18:53.905 --> 00:18:56.115
Do you plan on leaking a dating rumor?

00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:59.869
I'm not sure if "dating rumor"
would be the way to word it.

00:19:00.453 --> 00:19:02.246
An affair rumor sounds more appropriate.

00:19:03.039 --> 00:19:05.541
Call it whatever you want,
but don't bother writing it.

00:19:06.084 --> 00:19:07.418
I'm breaking up with him anyway.

00:19:09.003 --> 00:19:10.213
That's amusing.

00:19:10.296 --> 00:19:12.298
Why don't you write about
a new dating rumor

00:19:13.257 --> 00:19:15.843
instead of one that'll be over soon?

00:19:15.927 --> 00:19:17.261
A new dating rumor?

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:20.890
I'm joining Kang Pil-gu, you see.

00:19:21.808 --> 00:19:23.226
"Lim Hyeon-jun and Gwon Se-na
Said to Be Dating."

00:19:23.309 --> 00:19:26.104
I'll make sure you land an exclusive
within two months.

00:19:42.203 --> 00:19:44.872
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU

00:19:52.922 --> 00:19:54.173
I'm a fan of Lim Hyeon-jun.

00:19:54.924 --> 00:19:56.467
I have a whole box at home.

00:20:05.476 --> 00:20:06.394
What is it?

00:20:07.478 --> 00:20:08.354
Well…

00:20:08.438 --> 00:20:09.439
Something you want to say?

00:20:10.273 --> 00:20:11.774
No, I just…

00:20:13.818 --> 00:20:16.571
Did your friend tell you
he failed the audition because of me?

00:20:16.654 --> 00:20:18.031
No, that's not it.

00:20:20.533 --> 00:20:23.745
Well, he didn't say much,
but I think you really hurt his feelings.

00:20:24.829 --> 00:20:27.331
-You think he's got talent, don't you?
-Yeah.

00:20:27.415 --> 00:20:29.917
But he fails every audition, doesn't he?

00:20:30.001 --> 00:20:31.586
-Yeah.
-I'm sure he thinks

00:20:31.669 --> 00:20:34.172
he just hasn't had the chance
to show what he can do,

00:20:34.255 --> 00:20:37.216
but he'd be amazing if he did, right?

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:38.551
But he's wrong.

00:20:38.634 --> 00:20:40.970
Your friend is overconfident.

00:20:41.054 --> 00:20:43.431
There's a paper-thin line
between confidence and arrogance.

00:20:44.015 --> 00:20:45.600
Knowing your place
is essential for actors.

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:50.980
Then maybe you should
give up on melodramas.

00:20:52.231 --> 00:20:53.232
What?

00:20:53.316 --> 00:20:54.942
You're getting old,
and no one's sending you new scripts.

00:20:55.026 --> 00:20:57.236
So maybe you should
stick with Kang Pil-gu.

00:20:58.237 --> 00:20:59.864
You said knowing your place
is essential for actors.

00:21:04.368 --> 00:21:05.828
How could you say that to me?

00:21:10.458 --> 00:21:11.542
Damn it.

00:21:11.626 --> 00:21:12.919
Ms. Gwon Se-na.

00:21:13.002 --> 00:21:14.295
Is this some kind of joke?

00:21:14.378 --> 00:21:16.005
Does Mr. Lim know you're a two-timer?

00:21:16.089 --> 00:21:18.382
Why can't you end a relationship
before starting a new one?

00:21:18.466 --> 00:21:20.051
Put yourself in the other person's shoes!

00:21:23.554 --> 00:21:26.974
Why are you getting so worked up
over someone else's relationship?

00:21:27.642 --> 00:21:28.476
Fine.

00:21:30.144 --> 00:21:34.023
We'll wait and see
if Mr. Lim ends up being your boyfriend.

00:21:34.107 --> 00:21:37.110
I'm more interested in
your current boyfriend.

00:21:38.027 --> 00:21:40.822
I don't care about writing an article
about your affair.

00:21:42.824 --> 00:21:44.200
Just tell me about him.

00:21:46.702 --> 00:21:49.247
Assemblyman Ha Gee-wan.
You know him, right?

00:21:50.206 --> 00:21:52.750
Assemblyman Ha and your boyfriend

00:21:53.334 --> 00:21:54.961
seem to know each other well.

00:21:57.797 --> 00:21:59.382
Ms. Wi Jeong-sin.

00:21:59.465 --> 00:22:01.259
Do you have a life to spare?

00:22:02.343 --> 00:22:04.554
I've looked into you a bit.

00:22:04.637 --> 00:22:08.808
You were looking into my boyfriend
and then got transferred to the tabloid.

00:22:08.891 --> 00:22:10.309
If you keep digging into him,

00:22:10.393 --> 00:22:13.563
it won't end with you
getting kicked off the political desk.

00:22:13.646 --> 00:22:16.357
Whether I get kicked off
the political desk or fired,

00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:18.276
that's my business.

00:22:18.359 --> 00:22:19.360
However,

00:22:20.653 --> 00:22:22.155
now that you've met me,

00:22:22.238 --> 00:22:24.991
you'll need to tell me
everything about him.

00:22:27.118 --> 00:22:28.119
And why exactly

00:22:29.245 --> 00:22:30.246
would I do that?

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:32.498
You already know.

00:22:33.499 --> 00:22:37.920
That man's a damn bastard
who harms the greater good

00:22:38.588 --> 00:22:39.714
and moral decency.

00:22:44.594 --> 00:22:46.304
You weren't expecting

00:22:46.387 --> 00:22:49.056
to get what you wanted
all at once today, were you?

00:23:00.776 --> 00:23:02.153
Ms. Wi Jeong-sin.

00:23:02.862 --> 00:23:05.865
Let's get to know each other, shall we?

00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:20.004
Sure.

00:23:23.466 --> 00:23:25.176
That being said,

00:23:25.259 --> 00:23:28.387
I'll give you a tip
before my dating rumor gets leaked.

00:23:28.888 --> 00:23:30.806
I'm sure you'll find this amusing.

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:33.643
It's a blockbuster scandal.

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:40.066
She's insane.

00:23:41.067 --> 00:23:43.778
Who does she think she is,
saying he'll date her?

00:23:46.405 --> 00:23:47.907
Did you find out anything?

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:53.079
Nothing in particular.

00:23:53.663 --> 00:23:56.332
Nothing? How about staying
at the entertainment desk for good?

00:23:57.375 --> 00:23:58.918
Damn it.

00:24:04.257 --> 00:24:05.716
You're home early.

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:06.634
Yeah.

00:24:16.978 --> 00:24:18.771
At least wash your hands first.

00:24:25.569 --> 00:24:28.239
-Hey, where did you buy the rice cooker?
-Why?

00:24:28.322 --> 00:24:29.949
My friend who lives alone wants one.

00:24:30.032 --> 00:24:30.866
It's expensive.

00:24:31.951 --> 00:24:34.745
Jeez, you don't have to say it like that.

00:24:37.498 --> 00:24:38.666
MELOMASTER

00:24:42.086 --> 00:24:44.922
CHATS
MELOMASTER

00:24:47.466 --> 00:24:50.094
MELOMASTER'S ITEMS FOR SALE

00:25:00.271 --> 00:25:02.315
He hasn't marked it as sold.

00:25:04.191 --> 00:25:05.568
Is he a commercial seller?

00:25:14.076 --> 00:25:15.036
Onion!

00:25:15.745 --> 00:25:16.620
ONION
SOULISHERE SENT YOU A MESSAGE.

00:25:20.499 --> 00:25:22.918
Would it be possible
to buy another rice cooker from you?

00:25:23.002 --> 00:25:25.713
I noticed a few more boxes in the photo.

00:25:25.796 --> 00:25:27.923
Yes, of course.

00:25:28.007 --> 00:25:30.051
Wait. No, I can't.

00:25:30.134 --> 00:25:32.428
I sold a few of the down jackets
you received as gifts,

00:25:32.511 --> 00:25:34.597
and someone reported me
as a commercial seller.

00:25:37.641 --> 00:25:39.518
MELOMASTER:
OH…

00:25:39.602 --> 00:25:40.436
I'm sorry.

00:25:40.519 --> 00:25:43.564
I gave away the rest as gifts to friends.

00:25:44.648 --> 00:25:45.483
So he's not a commercial seller.

00:25:46.484 --> 00:25:49.612
I noticed it wasn't marked as sold,
so I thought I'd ask.

00:25:49.695 --> 00:25:52.031
It was my first time using Onion,
so I didn't know.

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:55.785
You seem to stay up late.

00:25:56.494 --> 00:25:57.578
I usually do.

00:26:00.122 --> 00:26:01.916
I was watching Kang Pil-gu.

00:26:01.999 --> 00:26:04.293
I'm rewatching it
to brush up for the new season.

00:26:06.128 --> 00:26:07.755
You seem like a bigger fan than me.

00:26:12.885 --> 00:26:15.596
Have you seen Kang Pil-gu in person,
by any chance?

00:26:16.472 --> 00:26:17.431
I have.

00:26:17.515 --> 00:26:18.766
Really?

00:26:18.849 --> 00:26:20.351
So have I!

00:26:21.185 --> 00:26:22.019
Seriously?

00:26:22.603 --> 00:26:23.604
Is that so?

00:26:25.981 --> 00:26:26.857
What did you think of him?

00:26:28.859 --> 00:26:30.236
He was very…

00:26:33.406 --> 00:26:34.573
He was really cool, of course.

00:26:35.449 --> 00:26:36.700
He's manly,

00:26:37.451 --> 00:26:38.411
yet still has that boyish charm.

00:26:41.497 --> 00:26:42.665
Do I really?

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.585
Come on.

00:26:46.669 --> 00:26:47.962
Come on.

00:26:49.088 --> 00:26:51.173
He's getting up there in age.

00:26:51.257 --> 00:26:52.299
I thought he looked…

00:26:53.884 --> 00:26:55.719
pretty old.

00:27:39.972 --> 00:27:41.056
Come on.

00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:43.309
You can be old and still be cool.

00:27:43.392 --> 00:27:46.228
Everyone has their own kind of charm
that suits their age.

00:27:47.938 --> 00:27:48.898
Do you think so?

00:27:48.981 --> 00:27:49.899
Do you think so?

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:52.776
By the way,
why do you need another rice cooker?

00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:54.945
My younger sibling's friend needs one.

00:27:56.614 --> 00:27:58.115
Do you live with your younger sibling?

00:27:58.949 --> 00:28:00.451
I live with my younger sibling too.

00:28:00.534 --> 00:28:01.952
Oh, really?

00:28:02.453 --> 00:28:04.538
Same here.
It's just my younger sibling and me.

00:28:04.622 --> 00:28:06.373
Our parents passed away at an early age.

00:28:12.713 --> 00:28:13.881
That must've been tough.

00:28:16.383 --> 00:28:19.386
I've been the man of the house
since I was young, so I get it.

00:28:20.888 --> 00:28:24.016
I used to be timid when making decisions,
but now I'm really decisive.

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:27.561
Growing up in the real world
without anyone to look out for me

00:28:27.645 --> 00:28:29.063
forced me to act tough.

00:28:31.398 --> 00:28:32.483
Why am I telling him this?

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:23.659
Ms. Kim?

00:29:24.159 --> 00:29:25.327
Excuse me, sir.

00:29:28.706 --> 00:29:31.208
We need to cancel
all the afternoon appointments.

00:29:31.709 --> 00:29:34.503
-Please tell the patients that I'm sorry.
-Of course.

00:29:34.587 --> 00:29:35.879
You know actor Yoon Jung-ho, right?

00:29:35.963 --> 00:29:38.257
He's a mature, charismatic actor
known for his strong acting.

00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:41.051
There are rumors going around
that he's dating a psychiatrist

00:29:41.135 --> 00:29:42.595
who is 30 years younger than him.

00:29:42.678 --> 00:29:46.140
Word got out because he recommended
his young girlfriend's clinic

00:29:46.223 --> 00:29:47.516
to a bunch of celebrities.

00:29:50.853 --> 00:29:52.313
I'm telling you, I'm here!

00:29:52.396 --> 00:29:53.939
I have to get
my prescription refilled anyway.

00:29:54.023 --> 00:29:55.316
Don't worry, Mr. Hwang.

00:29:55.399 --> 00:29:57.109
I came fully prepared
so no one would recognize me.

00:29:58.611 --> 00:29:59.653
-I'm sorry.
-Excuse me.

00:30:06.785 --> 00:30:07.745
What the heck?

00:30:12.541 --> 00:30:14.543
-Damn it.
-Hey!

00:30:14.627 --> 00:30:15.669
What's going on?

00:30:26.889 --> 00:30:30.225
How did you find out about this place?
I haven't told anyone!

00:30:30.309 --> 00:30:33.145
Did you bug my house and my phone?

00:30:33.228 --> 00:30:34.605
No, that's not it.

00:30:34.688 --> 00:30:36.148
-I came here to…
-How can a newbie actor

00:30:36.231 --> 00:30:38.442
have so much confidence in their acting?

00:30:40.194 --> 00:30:41.737
That's bizarre to me.

00:30:42.863 --> 00:30:44.865
I'm sorry, sir.

00:30:44.948 --> 00:30:46.450
I get it now.

00:30:46.533 --> 00:30:48.452
Are you here for revenge?

00:30:48.535 --> 00:30:52.414
Now do you understand how awful it feels
when your family gets dragged?

00:30:52.998 --> 00:30:54.792
What are you talking about?
I'm just here to--

00:30:54.875 --> 00:30:57.461
This is why you should
always be nice to others!

00:30:57.544 --> 00:30:58.837
I came here for something else!

00:30:58.921 --> 00:31:00.923
Don't lie! I won't fall for it!

00:31:01.006 --> 00:31:03.384
The director here is dating an actor,
and I'm here to cover the story,

00:31:03.467 --> 00:31:04.802
you idiot!

00:31:05.594 --> 00:31:06.595
"You idiot"?

00:31:06.679 --> 00:31:08.138
That's right!
You were rude first, you idiot!

00:31:08.722 --> 00:31:09.598
Now you're calling me an idiot?

00:31:09.682 --> 00:31:11.350
-Wow.
-Jeez.

00:31:12.393 --> 00:31:14.478
Are you telling the truth?
You're not here for me?

00:31:14.978 --> 00:31:16.647
I just said that wasn't the case!

00:31:19.233 --> 00:31:21.026
Hold on a second!

00:31:21.402 --> 00:31:22.569
What are you doing?

00:31:22.653 --> 00:31:24.279
Wait, 4451? That's the car.

00:31:24.363 --> 00:31:25.781
-Start the car.
-Why?

00:31:25.864 --> 00:31:28.409
-I have to follow that car!
-That has nothing to do with me.

00:31:28.492 --> 00:31:29.535
You dragged me out!

00:31:30.703 --> 00:31:32.204
-Start the car--
-Get out!

00:31:32.287 --> 00:31:33.747
Where's your car key? Hurry up!

00:31:33.831 --> 00:31:36.250
-Hey, hands off!
-Grab the steering wheel!

00:31:36.333 --> 00:31:38.752
-Get going!
-Damn it.

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:44.425
Don't follow them too closely.
They might notice.

00:31:45.134 --> 00:31:47.886
Are you ordering me around
because I'm an idiot superstar?

00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:49.930
Why are you following that doctor anyway?

00:31:51.557 --> 00:31:53.016
Do you promise not to tell anyone?

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:55.436
Seriously?
You're telling me to keep a secret?

00:31:56.687 --> 00:31:57.980
You know actor Yoon Jung-ho, right?

00:31:58.897 --> 00:32:00.107
They're dating.

00:32:01.066 --> 00:32:02.192
No way!

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:05.070
That's at least a 30-year age gap!

00:32:05.154 --> 00:32:08.240
Hold on. I know both of them.

00:32:08.323 --> 00:32:10.868
I can't do this.
Get out of my car, and I'll be on my way.

00:32:10.951 --> 00:32:12.494
-I don't think you can.
-Hey.

00:32:13.454 --> 00:32:16.331
They're going on the highway! Now what?

00:32:16.415 --> 00:32:17.916
What else? Follow them!

00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:20.002
No, I'm making a U-turn.

00:32:20.085 --> 00:32:22.838
-You can't do that on a highway! Just go!
-No!

00:32:22.921 --> 00:32:25.174
SPORTS EUNSEONG

00:32:25.257 --> 00:32:26.383
Leaving work?

00:32:28.302 --> 00:32:29.261
Yes.

00:32:31.263 --> 00:32:32.264
Buy me dinner.

00:32:34.308 --> 00:32:35.601
We're at work.

00:32:36.518 --> 00:32:38.187
Please buy me dinner, Mr. Lee.

00:32:38.270 --> 00:32:39.730
I'm feeling hungry after working late.

00:32:42.858 --> 00:32:44.109
The chef here

00:32:44.735 --> 00:32:47.196
first studied design in New York,
but then turned to cooking.

00:32:47.988 --> 00:32:50.783
Remember the restaurant near Hamilton Park
that we used to go to?

00:32:50.866 --> 00:32:52.534
The taste and atmosphere
are pretty similar here.

00:32:52.618 --> 00:32:53.911
You liked the steak there.

00:32:54.495 --> 00:32:55.954
That place closed down.

00:32:56.038 --> 00:32:57.915
The married couple who ran the place
worked well together

00:32:57.998 --> 00:33:00.501
until the wife's affair
led to their divorce.

00:33:01.293 --> 00:33:04.129
Maybe that's why the food went downhill
and the place went under.

00:33:07.341 --> 00:33:10.052
Why does it sound like
you're badmouthing me?

00:33:11.595 --> 00:33:12.763
I was talking about that couple.

00:33:13.388 --> 00:33:14.431
Not us.

00:33:14.515 --> 00:33:15.766
Don't you think I had a reason…

00:33:18.101 --> 00:33:19.520
for leaving the way I did?

00:33:20.103 --> 00:33:23.023
When the man you love
is on the brink of death,

00:33:23.607 --> 00:33:25.275
and you marry just three months later,

00:33:26.193 --> 00:33:29.029
no reason can justify that.

00:33:31.615 --> 00:33:33.951
So, have you forgotten me completely?

00:33:43.836 --> 00:33:45.045
That accident

00:33:45.128 --> 00:33:48.674
basically shattered my right leg.

00:33:49.258 --> 00:33:50.968
I thought I'd never stand again,

00:33:51.552 --> 00:33:52.678
but somehow, like magic,

00:33:53.887 --> 00:33:55.806
I was able to walk after a while.

00:33:56.849 --> 00:34:00.352
After more time passed, I was able to run.

00:34:01.645 --> 00:34:04.857
My right leg still hurts
when the weather is bad,

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:06.984
but it's fine because I can run now…

00:34:09.111 --> 00:34:11.154
despite thinking I'd never stand again.

00:34:15.659 --> 00:34:16.869
Does that answer your question?

00:34:54.698 --> 00:34:56.325
Why trust what an actor says?

00:34:56.825 --> 00:35:00.078
Celebrities and non-celebrities
always end in disaster.

00:35:13.967 --> 00:35:15.636
Get it together, Wi Jeong-sin.

00:35:16.178 --> 00:35:18.972
This guy is Lim Hyeon-jun,
not Kang Pil-gu.

00:35:19.056 --> 00:35:21.016
And I'm a reporter,
not a Kang Pil-gu fangirl.

00:35:21.099 --> 00:35:21.934
Snap out of it.

00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:27.731
Snap out of it.

00:35:30.859 --> 00:35:32.194
What are you saying?

00:35:33.445 --> 00:35:34.613
It's nothing.

00:35:35.781 --> 00:35:37.824
I can't believe you can sleep
at a time like this.

00:35:38.992 --> 00:35:40.953
-Where are we?
-Gangneung!

00:35:41.036 --> 00:35:43.664
What? We came all the way to Gangneung?

00:35:44.498 --> 00:35:47.292
I've been thinking while driving.

00:35:47.376 --> 00:35:49.503
You're passed out next to me,

00:35:49.586 --> 00:35:52.047
I'm a superstar tailing a veteran actor,

00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:53.840
and I'm trying to figure out
how to make sense

00:35:53.924 --> 00:35:55.634
of this ridiculous situation.

00:35:56.677 --> 00:36:00.764
Sure, I'm mostly to blame
for driving off in the first place.

00:36:00.847 --> 00:36:02.599
But now that it's come to this,

00:36:02.683 --> 00:36:04.267
I'll go along with the tailing

00:36:04.351 --> 00:36:06.812
and make sure to pull it off flawlessly.

00:36:07.396 --> 00:36:08.605
-Really?
-But in return,

00:36:08.689 --> 00:36:10.691
you need to do something for me.

00:36:11.483 --> 00:36:12.526
Just this once,

00:36:13.944 --> 00:36:16.154
-write an article I ask you to.
-What?

00:36:16.238 --> 00:36:18.448
You wrote so many articles about me

00:36:18.532 --> 00:36:20.325
that I became
the center of the gossip mill.

00:36:20.409 --> 00:36:23.203
But I'm willing to let all that go
for a single article.

00:36:23.286 --> 00:36:25.831
I'm making this offer
because I feel generous right now,

00:36:25.914 --> 00:36:28.083
so if you have a conscience,
just agree to it.

00:36:29.459 --> 00:36:32.671
I never take requests for articles,

00:36:33.255 --> 00:36:35.090
but I'll make an exception
under the condition

00:36:35.173 --> 00:36:36.883
that it's absolutely true

00:36:37.926 --> 00:36:38.760
and newsworthy.

00:36:39.344 --> 00:36:40.178
Good.

00:36:40.721 --> 00:36:42.639
From this point on, you owe me an article.

00:36:42.723 --> 00:36:43.932
What's it about?

00:36:44.016 --> 00:36:45.142
I don't know yet.

00:36:47.144 --> 00:36:48.562
Maybe a night's stay at a hotel?

00:36:48.645 --> 00:36:49.938
What?

00:36:50.022 --> 00:36:52.315
Are you crazy?
Why would I spend the night with you?

00:36:52.399 --> 00:36:54.401
I meant those two!

00:36:54.985 --> 00:36:57.237
Are you crazy? What were you thinking?

00:36:57.821 --> 00:36:59.489
Look, that car is heading into a hotel!

00:37:02.034 --> 00:37:03.201
Jeez.

00:37:17.299 --> 00:37:20.844
Man, I can't believe
they got past that age difference.

00:37:22.846 --> 00:37:25.348
Jeez, I never thought of him as the type.

00:37:26.975 --> 00:37:28.769
-Look at this hotel.
-No, my battery is dead!

00:37:29.352 --> 00:37:32.064
-Can you give me your phone?
-Why?

00:37:32.147 --> 00:37:33.523
-Just give it to me!
-Absolutely not!

00:37:33.607 --> 00:37:35.317
What do you want with it?

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:36.234
They went inside!

00:37:36.318 --> 00:37:38.737
Are you telling me
to take photos of them now?

00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:40.906
I bet the dashcam caught them. Let's see.

00:37:40.989 --> 00:37:42.699
I sent my dashcam in for repairs.

00:37:42.783 --> 00:37:44.117
-Don't touch it.
-What?

00:37:44.701 --> 00:37:46.411
That means we have to camp out!

00:37:46.495 --> 00:37:47.788
How is that my fault?

00:37:47.871 --> 00:37:48.872
Wait a minute.

00:37:49.372 --> 00:37:51.291
Do you mean we have to wait
until they come out?

00:37:51.374 --> 00:37:55.087
-We didn't come all this way for nothing.
-What does that have to do with me?

00:37:55.170 --> 00:37:56.755
Get out.

00:37:56.838 --> 00:37:58.882
-Just get out!
-No, I can't!

00:38:04.513 --> 00:38:06.306
First, you just climbed into my car.

00:38:06.389 --> 00:38:07.933
Now, you just made yourself comfortable.

00:38:08.016 --> 00:38:09.267
You're the one who put me in here.

00:38:12.896 --> 00:38:15.816
Do you want me to
get some coffee and gimbap?

00:38:16.775 --> 00:38:17.984
No, thank you.

00:38:22.531 --> 00:38:24.241
As far as cursed connections go,
ours is the worst.

00:38:24.324 --> 00:38:26.618
You stormed into the restroom
while I was taking care of business,

00:38:26.701 --> 00:38:27.786
wrote a dating rumor piece,

00:38:27.869 --> 00:38:30.872
wrote a string of articles trashing me,
and exposed my mom's private life.

00:38:32.457 --> 00:38:35.335
I've been trying to rise above so much
these past few months

00:38:35.418 --> 00:38:37.170
that I might start floating any second.

00:38:37.754 --> 00:38:40.340
You got me demoted to entertainment
because of the red carpet fiasco,

00:38:40.423 --> 00:38:41.883
kicked me out of a press conference,

00:38:41.967 --> 00:38:43.093
and thought I was a hostess.

00:38:43.718 --> 00:38:45.387
You're equally challenging.

00:38:46.012 --> 00:38:48.014
That's why I said
we're a cursed connection.

00:38:49.057 --> 00:38:51.017
There's a fine line
between cursed and fated--

00:38:51.101 --> 00:38:53.353
Don't say that! It made my blood run cold!

00:38:53.436 --> 00:38:54.896
-I bet it really woke you up.
-It did.

00:38:56.773 --> 00:38:58.733
Are you just going to sit here?

00:38:59.609 --> 00:39:01.444
You had no problem
sneaking into my hospital room.

00:39:01.528 --> 00:39:03.196
So why are you just waiting now?

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:05.407
This hotel is 20 stories tall.
What else can I do but wait?

00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:07.492
So we're just going to sit here
and do nothing?

00:39:07.576 --> 00:39:08.869
We need to at least try something.

00:39:08.952 --> 00:39:10.829
Should I start a fire, then?

00:39:20.505 --> 00:39:21.631
Damn it.

00:39:35.187 --> 00:39:36.479
Fire!

00:39:36.563 --> 00:39:38.607
You're insane!

00:39:38.690 --> 00:39:40.609
Have you lost your mind?
Did you really start a fire?

00:39:40.692 --> 00:39:41.568
They're coming out!

00:39:46.907 --> 00:39:49.576
Your phone! Where's your phone?

00:39:49.659 --> 00:39:50.660
Give it to me.

00:40:04.799 --> 00:40:06.718
Are you kidding me?

00:40:06.801 --> 00:40:07.844
Seriously?

00:40:09.554 --> 00:40:13.558
You didn't cover a story.
You committed a crime!

00:40:13.642 --> 00:40:15.018
It wasn't me!

00:40:15.101 --> 00:40:17.938
I just went in to check their floor
when it went off!

00:40:51.638 --> 00:40:53.431
Who believes what the paparazzi say?

00:40:53.515 --> 00:40:54.975
-What? Paparazzi?
-Jeez.

00:40:55.058 --> 00:40:56.518
That poor man.

00:40:56.601 --> 00:40:58.353
Even at 70, he's not free to date.

00:40:58.436 --> 00:41:01.314
In the US, people would just say
he's impressive and move on.

00:41:01.398 --> 00:41:03.191
Now, people are going to curse him out

00:41:03.275 --> 00:41:04.234
because of you.

00:41:04.317 --> 00:41:06.194
It's not my fault
this country isn't the US.

00:41:06.278 --> 00:41:09.698
I bet part of you is doing this
because you're jealous of others dating.

00:41:09.781 --> 00:41:12.659
When you see a happy couple,
do you feel the urge to rip them apart?

00:41:12.742 --> 00:41:14.452
Do I seem that extreme to you?

00:41:14.536 --> 00:41:16.204
Is there any proof that you aren't?

00:41:18.707 --> 00:41:19.749
Be honest.

00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:22.961
You've never dated anyone, have you?

00:41:23.044 --> 00:41:24.212
I bet you've been single since birth.

00:41:24.879 --> 00:41:25.714
No, I'm not!

00:41:25.797 --> 00:41:28.300
I can't blame you for being in denial.

00:41:28.383 --> 00:41:29.676
Let's say you're not.

00:41:29.759 --> 00:41:31.970
How many guys
have you dated after college?

00:41:32.887 --> 00:41:33.763
I guess about…

00:41:34.973 --> 00:41:36.016
Six?

00:41:38.768 --> 00:41:39.936
Six guys?

00:41:41.646 --> 00:41:43.398
-That's hilarious!
-I'm not lying!

00:41:44.816 --> 00:41:46.192
Seriously? Six?

00:41:47.402 --> 00:41:49.112
Man, that's even weirder.

00:41:49.988 --> 00:41:53.575
So are you saying
you went through six guys since then?

00:41:53.658 --> 00:41:54.492
Seriously?

00:41:54.576 --> 00:41:56.119
Holy cow.

00:41:56.202 --> 00:41:59.122
In any case, guys always hit on me first.

00:41:59.205 --> 00:42:01.291
I have the looks, you know.

00:42:02.667 --> 00:42:04.461
Man, that's hilarious.

00:42:04.544 --> 00:42:06.004
I haven't laughed this hard in a while.

00:42:08.381 --> 00:42:11.343
I just can't make it
past the two-month mark.

00:42:13.219 --> 00:42:14.304
Why is that?

00:42:14.387 --> 00:42:16.181
People keep talking about
the rights of perpetrators,

00:42:16.264 --> 00:42:19.059
but I want to ask them
what they think human rights mean.

00:42:19.142 --> 00:42:20.268
Our country is turning into a place

00:42:20.352 --> 00:42:22.604
where perpetrators have rights
but victims don't.

00:42:22.687 --> 00:42:23.855
What do you think, Yong-u?

00:42:23.938 --> 00:42:27.192
In terms of defining human rights,
especially victims' rights…

00:42:27.275 --> 00:42:30.528
I'm naturally interested in social issues
because of my job.

00:42:30.612 --> 00:42:33.531
Stand up, hold, engage your arms.

00:42:33.615 --> 00:42:35.033
Now, go down slowly.

00:42:35.116 --> 00:42:36.701
Just like that.

00:42:36.785 --> 00:42:38.870
Now, hold the tension…

00:42:38.953 --> 00:42:40.246
What? Sexual harassment?

00:42:40.330 --> 00:42:42.916
I asked how they harassed the victim,
you little shit!

00:42:42.999 --> 00:42:44.125
You don't know?

00:42:44.209 --> 00:42:47.253
You should at least f****** know
if they touched her chest or butt,

00:42:47.337 --> 00:42:48.671
you f****** idiot!

00:42:49.255 --> 00:42:51.049
What the hell did you cover all day?

00:42:51.132 --> 00:42:54.135
Didn't I say we need to rip apart bastards
who sexually harass people?

00:42:54.219 --> 00:42:55.428
Do your damn job or quit!

00:42:59.057 --> 00:42:59.891
Hey, honey!

00:42:59.974 --> 00:43:04.229
The only thing I did wrong
was doing my best at my job.

00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:06.981
I wanted to act with integrity,

00:43:07.065 --> 00:43:08.900
but men with no integrity
never gave me a shot.

00:43:10.318 --> 00:43:12.570
Jeez, don't try to sugarcoat it.

00:43:12.654 --> 00:43:14.531
You basically did whatever you wanted

00:43:14.614 --> 00:43:16.574
and then got dumped within two months.

00:43:30.255 --> 00:43:33.591
I won't deny it,
and everything is a two-way street.

00:43:34.467 --> 00:43:37.429
I suppose I'm partially to blame
for them not liking me anymore.

00:43:37.512 --> 00:43:40.348
You talk about having integrity,
yet you denied the dating rumor.

00:43:40.432 --> 00:43:42.517
That was three years ago,
and I saw her for a month.

00:43:43.017 --> 00:43:45.019
-Jeez.
-Are most celebrities like that?

00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:48.148
Can't you just admit you're dating
and go about it naturally?

00:43:48.231 --> 00:43:51.025
It's not that easy for people like us.

00:43:51.109 --> 00:43:54.195
I'm sure that's what you think,
but people are all the same.

00:43:55.113 --> 00:43:58.241
The second you think you're special,
that's when trouble starts.

00:44:01.035 --> 00:44:02.328
"Lim Hyeon-jun and Gwon Se-na
Said to Be Dating."

00:44:02.412 --> 00:44:05.748
I'll make sure you land an exclusive
within two months.

00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:11.337
So you basically test the waters
with non-celebrities

00:44:11.921 --> 00:44:14.632
but then secretly date a superstar
like Gwon Se-na.

00:44:19.262 --> 00:44:20.472
Gwon Se-na?

00:44:23.224 --> 00:44:24.559
I saw her when you were in the hospital.

00:44:24.642 --> 00:44:26.311
She came to see you.

00:44:29.189 --> 00:44:30.064
Who are you?

00:44:38.573 --> 00:44:39.949
Don't worry.

00:44:40.033 --> 00:44:42.368
If I wanted to write a dating rumor,
I would've done it then.

00:44:47.332 --> 00:44:50.835
You dig up what people
absolutely want to keep private

00:44:52.170 --> 00:44:54.005
and make them uncomfortable.

00:44:54.088 --> 00:44:55.131
Well, that's what my job--

00:44:55.215 --> 00:44:56.090
Let's go.

00:44:57.467 --> 00:44:58.384
But…

00:45:40.552 --> 00:45:43.596
What happened today wasn't deliberate,
but I'm sorry all the same.

00:45:47.058 --> 00:45:47.934
Get home safely.

00:45:49.102 --> 00:45:52.438
Ever since I met you,
my life has been a mess.

00:45:54.148 --> 00:45:55.984
Whether it's your fault or not…

00:45:58.152 --> 00:45:59.487
let's never cross paths again.

00:46:02.782 --> 00:46:04.242
It all ends today.

00:46:55.335 --> 00:46:57.503
I'm sure that's what you think,

00:46:57.587 --> 00:46:59.339
but people are all the same.

00:46:59.422 --> 00:47:02.800
The second you think you're special,
that's when trouble starts.

00:47:09.932 --> 00:47:12.393
So you basically test the waters
with non-celebrities

00:47:13.019 --> 00:47:16.397
but then secretly date a superstar
like Gwon Se-na.

00:47:21.611 --> 00:47:23.488
I saw her when you were in the hospital.

00:47:24.656 --> 00:47:26.157
She came to see you.

00:47:43.383 --> 00:47:46.886
You dig up what people
absolutely want to keep private

00:47:48.221 --> 00:47:50.098
and make them uncomfortable.

Not yet.

00:48:47.739 --> 00:48:50.074
Why are you still up, Melomaster?

00:48:50.658 --> 00:48:52.076
I just…

00:48:52.660 --> 00:48:55.830
I had something upsetting happen today.

00:48:57.123 --> 00:48:57.999
Me too.

00:48:58.583 --> 00:49:01.252
Did something happen to you, Soulishere?

00:49:04.714 --> 00:49:06.132
It was one of those days

00:49:06.215 --> 00:49:08.593
that made me think,
"Who am I? Where am I?"

00:49:10.428 --> 00:49:13.723
It sounds like
you're fed up with your job.

00:49:14.223 --> 00:49:16.684
You hit the nail on the head.
How did you know?

00:49:17.268 --> 00:49:20.104
People are pretty much the same, right?

00:49:21.189 --> 00:49:22.315
Melomaster,

00:49:23.399 --> 00:49:25.276
are you who you dreamed of
becoming as a kid?

00:49:33.534 --> 00:49:36.913
If you're asking
if my childhood dreams came true,

00:49:37.663 --> 00:49:38.581
I guess they did.

00:49:38.664 --> 00:49:40.082
You're lucky.

00:49:41.334 --> 00:49:43.044
What did you dream of becoming as a kid?

00:49:44.003 --> 00:49:45.630
I wanted to be like my mom.

00:49:51.219 --> 00:49:52.220
"Mom"?

00:49:53.346 --> 00:49:54.180
Your mom?

00:49:54.931 --> 00:49:56.390
When I was really young,

00:49:56.474 --> 00:49:58.267
I got a lot of attention
because of my mom.

00:49:58.351 --> 00:49:59.227
Let's go again.

00:49:59.310 --> 00:50:02.063
-Rock, paper, scissors!
-Rock, paper, scissors!

00:50:02.897 --> 00:50:03.856
I won again.

00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:05.525
Jin-hui, are you having fun?

00:50:05.608 --> 00:50:08.319
Goodness, you must be
Ms. Seong Ae-suk's son.

00:50:08.402 --> 00:50:09.570
You look just like her.

00:50:09.654 --> 00:50:11.197
Do you know my mom?

00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:13.991
Of course.
Your mom is a very famous actress.

00:50:14.075 --> 00:50:15.409
I didn't know at the time

00:50:15.493 --> 00:50:18.412
that it was curiosity masked in kindness.

00:50:18.955 --> 00:50:21.999
When I grew older
and discovered the truth,

00:50:22.083 --> 00:50:24.418
the shock has stayed with me to this day.

00:50:24.919 --> 00:50:27.213
-Seriously, Mom!
-Hyeon-jun, let go of me!

00:50:27.296 --> 00:50:29.924
My mom gave me a dream,

00:50:30.508 --> 00:50:32.677
but she also got in the way of it.

00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:34.345
I heard your mother is
actress Seong Ae-suk…

00:50:34.428 --> 00:50:37.598
It says your mother is Seong Ae-suk,
an erotic film actress from the '70s.

00:50:38.850 --> 00:50:41.394
Sometimes, my family makes life harder
than anyone else.

00:50:41.936 --> 00:50:44.272
Maybe that's why I'm so obsessed

00:50:45.064 --> 00:50:46.941
with how others see me.

00:50:49.110 --> 00:50:53.030
Why am I saying all this
to someone I don't even know?

00:50:53.865 --> 00:50:55.449
I envy that, though.

00:50:56.033 --> 00:50:57.577
I envy that, though.

00:50:59.662 --> 00:51:00.913
You envy me?

00:51:03.291 --> 00:51:07.295
I wish my family
would rely on me financially.

00:51:07.879 --> 00:51:09.046
On paydays,

00:51:09.964 --> 00:51:12.967
I wish I could treat my family
to tons of snow crab.

00:51:13.926 --> 00:51:15.553
And on days like my mom's birthday,

00:51:15.636 --> 00:51:18.723
I want her to ask me for a luxury bag
and make me pay for it over 24 months.

00:51:18.806 --> 00:51:20.057
I dream of such things.

00:51:21.267 --> 00:51:24.478
I wish my family
would use me like that, even once.

00:51:26.731 --> 00:51:28.024
I guess I was immature.

00:51:31.152 --> 00:51:32.236
I actually

00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:34.322
look a lot like Lim Hyeon-jun.

00:51:34.405 --> 00:51:35.823
What? Really?

00:51:35.907 --> 00:51:37.533
I even sound like him,

00:51:37.617 --> 00:51:39.452
to the point where everyone falls for it.

00:51:39.535 --> 00:51:40.661
You're joking.

00:51:42.747 --> 00:51:43.748
I'm telling the truth.

00:51:44.332 --> 00:51:46.042
It sounds really similar.

00:51:55.259 --> 00:51:56.594
I guess I'll find out.

-Honey, have you seen this video?
-Yeah?

00:52:23.955 --> 00:52:25.498
-What video?
-Yoon Jung-ho is in it.

00:52:25.581 --> 00:52:28.042
He's dating a doctor
30 years younger than him.

00:52:28.125 --> 00:52:30.711
-She's 30 years younger?
-Yeah, he's a piece of trash!

00:52:30.795 --> 00:52:32.964
Jeez, it's something you'd see
out of Hollywood.

00:52:33.047 --> 00:52:35.174
Can you believe it?
She's 30 years younger!

WITH A PSYCHIATRIST 30 YEARS HIS JUNIOR

That man's impressive.

00:52:45.893 --> 00:52:47.353
It says "in love,"
but I read it as "senile."

00:52:47.436 --> 00:52:48.980
Do they think they're in Hollywood?

00:52:49.063 --> 00:52:50.398
The doctor's already been doxxed.

00:52:50.481 --> 00:52:51.732
When Yoon Jung-ho
was on his second divorce,

00:52:51.816 --> 00:52:53.359
she was crawling around in diapers.

00:52:53.442 --> 00:52:55.111
It's none of your business
if they like each other.

00:52:55.194 --> 00:52:57.446
An article about his fifth divorce
will be released three years from now.

00:52:57.530 --> 00:52:59.115
Who believes what the paparazzi say?

00:52:59.198 --> 00:53:00.825
That poor man.

00:53:00.908 --> 00:53:02.618
Even at 70, he's not free to date.

00:53:02.702 --> 00:53:05.538
Now, people are going to curse him out
because of you.

00:53:23.097 --> 00:53:25.141
I'll get you back to the main paper
within three months.

00:53:30.855 --> 00:53:31.689
You're leaving?

00:53:32.606 --> 00:53:35.151
It hasn't even been three months,
and you're bailing?

00:53:35.735 --> 00:53:36.777
I'm sorry.

00:53:36.861 --> 00:53:38.320
Do you hate it that much here?

00:53:40.364 --> 00:53:41.532
It feels like

00:53:42.825 --> 00:53:44.076
my self-esteem is slipping.

00:53:45.745 --> 00:53:48.956
Ms. Wi, did you always possess
weak self-esteem?

00:53:52.168 --> 00:53:53.252
I guess so.

00:53:54.503 --> 00:53:55.379
Fine.

00:53:56.172 --> 00:53:58.090
You should go
if your self-esteem is slipping.

00:53:59.508 --> 00:54:00.634
But…

00:54:02.094 --> 00:54:04.263
-Are you okay, Chief?
-What do you mean?

00:54:04.847 --> 00:54:07.683
You were an economic reporter
for quite some time.

00:54:08.893 --> 00:54:09.935
I left all that behind.

00:54:10.019 --> 00:54:12.396
You need to be humble
if you have something to lose.

00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:14.023
If you had nothing to lose back then,

00:54:14.815 --> 00:54:16.150
would it have been much different now?

00:54:16.233 --> 00:54:19.487
I'd be living like you,
not knowing to be afraid.

00:54:19.570 --> 00:54:20.863
And not knowing…

00:54:22.406 --> 00:54:24.658
that there are things
more precious than my own life.

00:54:27.870 --> 00:54:28.996
It was a short time,

00:54:30.247 --> 00:54:31.165
but I learned a lot from you.

00:54:33.375 --> 00:54:34.710
Enough. You're making me cringe.

00:54:38.672 --> 00:54:39.673
Here we go.

00:54:40.216 --> 00:54:43.385
She wasn't with us long,
but here's to Ms. Wi!

00:54:43.469 --> 00:54:45.513
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

00:54:45.596 --> 00:54:46.555
Thanks for your hard work.

00:54:47.973 --> 00:54:49.642
I'm sad you're leaving.

00:54:49.725 --> 00:54:52.812
-You did well.
-I'm sad to see you go.

00:54:53.854 --> 00:54:54.897
Drink up.

00:55:36.272 --> 00:55:38.315
Ms. Wi, are you okay?

00:55:38.399 --> 00:55:40.609
Ms. Wi, wake up.

00:55:41.986 --> 00:55:44.697
Here, sit up.

00:55:44.780 --> 00:55:46.532
Have some water.

00:55:47.366 --> 00:55:48.617
-Drink this.
-Jeez.

00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:50.786
You can't drink it?

00:55:52.079 --> 00:55:53.914
If it's too much, do you want to go home?

00:55:54.874 --> 00:55:55.875
Yes.

00:55:55.958 --> 00:55:57.168
Despite the late hour

00:55:57.918 --> 00:55:59.378
and the short notice,

00:55:59.461 --> 00:56:03.841
I'm very grateful to all the reporters
who could make it here today.

00:56:04.717 --> 00:56:07.761
I have called this press conference

00:56:07.845 --> 00:56:10.139
to address the dating rumors
involving a female doctor.

00:56:10.222 --> 00:56:14.935
The person identified as my partner
in an exclusive report

00:56:15.019 --> 00:56:17.313
is actually my biological daughter.

00:56:22.985 --> 00:56:24.987
Okay, here we go.

00:56:34.622 --> 00:56:38.375
Regarding Sports Eunseong,
the media outlet behind the article,

00:56:38.459 --> 00:56:40.127
and Reporter Wi Jeong-sin,

00:56:40.711 --> 00:56:43.631
I will be suing them for defamation.

00:56:49.178 --> 00:56:50.221
Hello?

00:57:00.272 --> 00:57:01.357
Hello?

00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:02.524
Hello?

00:57:03.943 --> 00:57:05.527
SOULISHERE (ONION FRIEND)

00:57:08.447 --> 00:57:09.782
Hello?

Hello?

00:57:17.748 --> 00:57:18.707
Hello?

00:57:22.711 --> 00:57:23.629
Hello?

00:57:24.672 --> 00:57:25.923
Is anyone there?

00:57:45.276 --> 00:57:46.277
Was that her boyfriend?

00:57:47.569 --> 00:57:48.570
Is she married?

00:58:36.327 --> 00:58:38.162
SPECIAL THANKS TO OH YEON-SEO
FOR HER APPEARANCE

00:58:41.081 --> 00:58:42.374
Take care of this yourself.

00:58:42.458 --> 00:58:44.543
If he doesn't drop the lawsuit,
don't even think of coming in.

00:58:44.626 --> 00:58:46.670
Did he say he'd drop the lawsuit?

00:58:46.754 --> 00:58:48.505
Just start by apologizing.

00:58:48.964 --> 00:58:50.924
Did you call because you were concerned?

00:58:51.884 --> 00:58:55.054
You really do sound
exactly like Lim Hyeon-jun.

00:58:55.137 --> 00:58:56.305
Thank you.

00:58:56.388 --> 00:58:59.516
There's this total jerk
who's been giving me a really hard time.
