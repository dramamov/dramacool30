00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:05.780
(20 years ago)

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.150
(Ambulance)

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.260
- There's an accident up ahead.
- Really?

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.330
Yes.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.830
I need to go check it out.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.070
Ma'am, could you please watch
the baby for a moment?

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.440
- Of course.
- Okay.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.620
Sweetie, what's wrong?

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:48.720
Sweetie!

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.560
Why aren't you breathing?
Sweetie, no.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.960
You can't do this. Come on.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.430
If something happens to you,
what about your mother?

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.870
Please, just breathe. Please?

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.010
Your mother can't live
if something happens to you.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.210
Sweetie. I won't be able to live either.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.210
Please... Hey, someone...

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.640
(Episode 106)

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.910
- Is she in a coma?
- Yes, the adult is.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.450
- Prep her vitals, stat.
- Yes.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.820
(Paramedic)

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.460
Ma'am!

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.260
The medical staff is waiting.
Please go straight to the ER.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.400
Hey, ma'am!

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.000
We're at the hospital.
Where are you going?

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.640
My baby is fine now,
so we'll just be going.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.180
Ma'am!

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:19.880
Are you sure she's okay?

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.610
- Let me just check...
- I said she was fine!

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.880
The baby's mother is waiting,
so we have to go.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.750
Hey, ma'am!

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.260
She received emergency treatment
at the hospital,

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.100
and she was fine right away.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.000
Look, Ms. Kyung Chae.
She's a beautiful little princess.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.540
You scared Mommy.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.840
I thought I was going to lose you.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.410
I was worried sick waiting for you.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.020
If anything had happened to you,
I wouldn't have been able to go on.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.290
After everything I went through
to have you...

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.590
How could I ever live without you?

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.360
That incident...

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.500
I had completely forgotten about it.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.500
Why is that day coming back to me now?

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.640
This can't be happening.

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.580
Why is something from 20 years ago
surfacing now of all times?

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.610
I erased that from my memory.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.950
What am I supposed to do now
that it's all coming back?

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:40.890
Then...

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.500
the baby's mother from that day...

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.560
is Madam Jung?

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.270
How can this be...

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.040
How...

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.440
Ms. Kyung Chae...

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.550
What am I going to do now?

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.920
The baby's mother
from that day is Madam Jung,

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.160
and Se Ri is her daughter...

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.930
How could a mother and daughter...

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.670
come full circle
and end up in the same house,

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:22.630
living as mother and daughter again?

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.240
It's unbelievable.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.010
How could something like this
possibly happen?

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.740
How could this happen?

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:32.780
How?

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.550
Then...

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.520
What happened to
Ms. Kyung Chae's real daughter?

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.660
Back then, I'm sure...

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.850
Ms. Kyung Chae's real daughter
must have died that day.

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:15.620
Don't tell me...

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.560
she survived, and that woman raised her,
thinking she was her own child?

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:20.660
That can't be. Right?

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.000
If that were true, there's no way
she'd pretend she never had a child.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.860
That can't be, right? It can't be.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.800
What in the world is going on?

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.700
But still,

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.470
how could a birth mother and daughter...

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.170
end up in the same house, of all places...

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.010
How could this happen...

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.190
If Ms. Kyung Chae finds out the truth...

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:53.790
No!

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.290
No!

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.340
I looked into it,

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:07.710
and Lawyer Kim didn't come in
to work today either.

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.440
He must be in deep shock.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.640
But so what? Business is business,
and personal is personal.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:16.510
What's business and what's personal here?

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.490
He's useful when we're teaming up
to take over Mingang Distribution.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:24.660
But he's someone to watch out for
and can't be Se Ri's stepfather.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.190
Then, who do you think would be
a good stepfather for Se Ri?

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:30.330
Well...

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.600
If I had to pick from people around us...

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:33.770
Moon Tae Kyung?

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.700
I'd be okay with someone like him.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.610
If you know he's a good person,
why do you give him such a hard time?

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.270
I told you that
we were on different paths.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.480
If someone gets in my way,

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.350
I have to cut them loose,
even if they're good.

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:48.650
What else can I do?

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:54.490
Since you can probably guess
what I'm about to ask,

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:57.420
it makes it even harder to bring it up.

00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:59.890
Since I'm the one
by my mother's side right now,

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:02.490
you want to know what my mother
and CEO Min are plotting,

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:04.500
and what their next moves will be.

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:06.400
You want me to tip you off. Is that it?

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:11.640
I'm sorry.
I know that for you, Tae Joo,

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.840
- it means betraying someone you care for.
- I'll do it.

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:19.240
I don't want my mother to commit
an even greater sin.

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.010
Thank you, Tae Joo.

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.610
So, what's the first thing I need to do?

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:25.080
Chairman Min Doo Sik.

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:28.620
I need you to find out
where he is right now.

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:30.860
By the way, Mother,

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:33.190
where do you suppose
Chairman Min is right now?

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:36.460
I don't know. He's likely fine somewhere.

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:37.760
Why do you ask?

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.400
You need to know as well.

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:43.570
We'd be in trouble if Lawyer Kim acted out
and caused trouble.

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:47.410
- Did Kim Sun Jae cause trouble?
- Just think about it.

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:51.580
He feels so betrayed by you and CEO Min
that he's skipping work without a word.

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:53.710
What if he decides
to sabotage everything...

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.810
and leaks Chairman Min's location
to the other side?

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:57.150
You have a point.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.990
I wouldn't put it past a guy
like Kim Sun Jae.

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:04.420
Wait a minute. Then what should we do?

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.360
Should I ask CEO Min where Min Doo Sik is?

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:22.870
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:26.940
What? Did this old hound
suddenly become useful to you?

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:30.950
Now that I know how you really see me,
Min Kyung Chae,

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.990
I won't fall for your tricks anymore.

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:47.270
Why is Manager Gong here at this hour?

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.140
What is with her?

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.370
What am I going to do?

00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:03.550
I was wrong. Please forgive me.

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:12.220
Please forgive me.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.330
Please forgive me.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.530
Are you crazy?

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:23.570
What do you think you're doing
going in there?

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:25.270
Manager Gong, what's wrong?

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:27.310
Let go of me!

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.040
Just let me die.

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:33.010
Ms. Kyung Chae and Se Ri will only be safe
if I'm dead and gone.

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.110
Stop it and just talk to me.

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:39.850
Please forgive me.

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:43.120
I'm so scared.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.760
How could this be happening
unless the skies are angry?

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.900
For something that happened 20 years ago
to come back around like this...

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:55.300
Come on, just say something
that makes sense!

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:58.140
No, I can't! I absolutely can't!

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:04.140
How can I say...

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:06.410
I switched the two babies
with my own two hands?

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:08.080
How can I say it? I'll never be able to!

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:09.610
I never can!

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:17.590
If I just die and disappear,
this will all be buried with me.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.330
I have to die.
I have to die and disappear.

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:23.630
You want to die that badly?

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.860
Then fine, die! Come on!

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:28.070
- Please, spare me!
- Go and die!

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:29.870
- Please, spare me!
- Die!

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.440
Please, spare me.

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:35.440
I had forgotten all about it.

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.810
I had truly forgotten about it.

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:39.580
For 20 years,

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:43.380
it never once crossed my mind that
Se Ri wasn't Ms. Kyung Chae's daughter.

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:46.750
Not even once. It never crossed my mind.

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:49.720
So what do you want me to do now
after all this time?

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:53.220
I've been lying to myself this whole time.

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:58.060
I completely blocked it out.
So what am I supposed to do now?

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:02.300
Please, let me live!

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:04.870
Please, spare me...

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:09.240
I'll let you live,

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:12.110
so tell me the truth.
Don't leave a single thing out.

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:16.410
Or else, forget Min Kyung Chae.
I'll deal with you myself, right now.

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:19.320
Even if I don't kill you right now,
there are countless other ways to get you.

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:21.120
You know I'm a lawyer, right?

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:22.820
And you know what will happen...

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:24.520
if I use the full force
of the law against you.

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:29.290
So spill it while I'm still being nice.

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:42.870
(Jinwon Genetic Research Institute)

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:57.490
They are confirmed to be
biologically related?

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:01.060
Whose results are these?

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:05.830
Lucia and Ms. Se Ri.

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:09.430
What did you just say?

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:16.210
Please, let me live!

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:19.440
Please, let me live!

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.580
Did you come all the way here
just for that?

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:24.750
You could have just called.

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:27.550
I wanted to see you too while I was at it.

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:29.820
Anyway, where's Chairman Min?

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.390
He's at Hanmyeong Hospital.

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:34.830
I know a doctor in the VIP Ward there,

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:37.190
and the nurses are all aware
of our situation.

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:40.100
I'll let them know
you have clearance to visit.

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:41.970
I'd appreciate that.

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:45.570
By the way, I heard Kim Sun Jae
didn't show up for work again today.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:48.510
Forget work.
He's not even answering my calls.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.840
If he keeps missing work,
shouldn't you fire him?

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.950
I told you
lawyers like him were a dime a dozen.

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.350
I know many people who can support you.

00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:59.080
You know how well-connected I am, right?

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:01.620
I know. You're a woman of many talents.

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:04.690
Still, I should give him
a little more time.

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:07.990
He's not the type to take it lying down
if I fire him.

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:11.100
You filed Chairman Min
and Lucia's divorce document, right?

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:12.300
Of course.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:13.700
They should have been filed by now.

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:16.700
So, does that make it final right away?

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:19.600
I'm sure it'll take some time to process.

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:23.170
Are you leaving already?

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:25.340
Let's get together with Se Ri soon.

00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:27.280
I miss her already.

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:30.450
Blood is thicker than water.

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:33.520
Just let me know when and where,
and I'll bring her.

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:43.160
Take me to Hanmyeong Hospital.

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:46.760
I need to see for myself
what that old geezer is up to.

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.200
Yes, ma'am.

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:05.220
So the girl who jumped from the roof
that day...

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.450
was Min Kyung Chae's daughter.

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:11.620
So in the end, she devoured her own child
with her own two hands?

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:16.060
And Baek Sul Hee has no idea
she's seeking revenge for the wrong kid.

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:20.260
What an absolute mess. Unbelievable.

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:23.570
Wait a minute.

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:27.370
If Se Ri is Baek Sul Hee's daughter,

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:30.140
then that means she's my daughter.

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:34.140
Then, if Se Ri succeeds Min Kyung Chae
as chairman,

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:38.450
my own bloodline will be in control
of Mingang...

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:43.490
This is how it's all playing out?

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:46.520
Is this really happening?

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:59.300
Mingang will finally be mine!

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:20.890
You poor thing.

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:24.800
A once-mighty tycoon
who dominated the business world...

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:26.900
is lying here like a living corpse...

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:29.200
hidden where your own kids
can't find you. How pitiful.

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:33.940
You're as good as blind
with your eyes wide open.

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:38.980
That's why you should've had
a kinder heart.

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:40.910
Let's be honest.

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:44.720
Think of all the sins you've committed,
haven't you?

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:47.080
How did she know I was here?

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.990
Well, Chairman Min Doo Sik.

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:51.420
You don't recognize me?

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:54.630
People say...

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:58.160
I look a lot like my son.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.570
You're not very observant, are you?

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:03.730
Twenty years ago,

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:06.740
the man Min Kyung Chae dated
in the States,

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:09.210
Jung Ho Se...

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:12.140
was my son.

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:16.110
Then you must be that punk's...

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:17.610
That's right.

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:19.980
To put it in your words,

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:22.190
I'm that scumbag's mother.

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:27.420
If you hadn't killed my son
and made it look like a car accident,

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:30.090
we wouldn't have ended up
in this twisted fate.

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:34.770
But guess what?

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:39.300
Se Ri turns out to be
my son's flesh and blood.

00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:43.240
I guess that makes me...

00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:46.140
her grandmother.

00:16:58.760 --> 00:16:59.790
Manager Gong!

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:06.630
Where have you been all day?
I was so worried about you.

00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:09.330
Me?

00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:12.970
Of course I was worried!

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:14.170
You didn't answer your phone.

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:16.740
I was a nervous wreck,
thinking something terrible had happened.

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.310
But I'm just glad you're back now.

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:28.620
From now on, do exactly as I say.

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:32.660
It's the only way to save Se Ri
and yourself, Manager Gong.

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:38.430
First, you never switched
the two babies 20 years ago.

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:42.770
Se Ri is still Min Kyung Chae's daughter,
part of the Min family,

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:45.940
and the future heir
to Mingang Distribution.

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:48.940
Just as you've lived,
forget it ever happened.

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:50.910
You'll take that secret to your grave.

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:52.810
Otherwise, a lot of people will get hurt.
You know that, right?

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:59.820
Now, go home and act
like everything is normal.

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:03.790
But what about Ms. Soo Jung?

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:06.760
Don't worry about Director Min.
I'll take care of her.

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:10.060
Se Ri.

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:12.730
No matter what anyone says,
you're Ms. Kyung Chae's daughter.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.630
I'll protect that truth to my dying day.

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:20.370
You're absolutely not Lucia's daughter.

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:33.880
What were the results of the DNA test?

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:38.760
Just as you predicted,
did it confirm they're mother-daughter?

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:41.690
That whole thing already caused
a huge scene this morning.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.030
I was late for work,
waiting on the results,

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:46.200
and I forgot it was the payment deadline
for our suppliers.

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:48.670
I got called into the CEO's office
over that, too.

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:51.470
My goodness, she gave me such an earful.

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:54.670
The point is,
I still don't have the results.

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:57.340
- I thought they were coming out today.
- I haven't seen them.

00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:00.240
That's why
I'm going to visit the lab myself.

00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:01.710
Let me go with you.

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:05.120
No. If we go together,
it'll just look suspicious.

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:08.220
And we can't have anyone finding out.
You should just stay here, Director Oh.

00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:11.620
I'll go get the results and call you.

00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:13.890
Okay, then please call me right away.

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:18.060
"Unwed mother Min Kyung Chae
and her illegitimate daughter, Min Se Ri."

00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:22.100
I've already got reporters lined up
to make it a front-page story.

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:28.270
Where are you going, Director Min?

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:31.440
It's none of your business where I go.

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:34.080
Do I have to report my every move to you?

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:35.580
No, you don't have to report to me.

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:37.650
As long as what you're doing is legal.

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:43.190
A DNA test performed without the consent
of the parties involved...

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:46.760
is a violation
of the Bioethics and Safety Act.

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:50.960
Collecting a specimen without consent
and using the results of that test...

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:54.360
violates an individual's privacy
and personal rights.

00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:57.670
Just so you know,
you can be held liable for damages.

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:01.340
How would you know that?

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:03.910
Also, please know that DNA test results
conducted without consent...

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:07.340
are also inadmissible
as evidence in court.

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:14.690
Furthermore,
the company that performed the DNA test...

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:17.520
could also face the same penalties
without proper consent.

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:23.960
I'd stay quiet if I were you.

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:26.100
You never know.

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:29.930
I might take pity on you,
put in a good word with the CEO,

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:32.340
and maybe even help you
keep your director position.

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.580
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:45.620
(Mingang Distribution)

00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:53.720
You haven't answered my calls
or come to the office for days.

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:55.360
What on earth have you been doing?

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:59.860
I was thinking about the kind of person
you were, Min Kyung Chae.

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:02.330
And what you meant to me.

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:04.430
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:06.740
Well, you're back and in one piece,
so that's all that matters.

00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:09.270
I was worried
you'd gotten into an accident.

00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:12.540
- Were you worried?
- Of course I was.

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:16.210
I entrusted you with the divorce papers
for my father and Lucia.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:17.610
You think I wouldn't be worried?

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:19.480
So that's what this was all about.

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:23.490
Right. I suppose
that's the main priority for you.

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:25.460
Don't worry.

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.290
I've filed the papers,

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:29.430
and the administrative procedures
will be finalized soon.

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:30.760
That's great to hear.

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:34.560
Once her name is off the family register,
I'll kick Lucia out of the house...

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:37.500
and finally run things my way.

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:45.340
So, are you saying Madam Jang
was at the company earlier?

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.280
It looked like she stopped by
the CEO's office.

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:49.550
It looked like Tae Joo was with her, too.

00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:51.520
Actually,

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:54.180
I asked Tae Joo for a favor.

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:57.890
What did you ask Tae Joo to do?

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:00.490
Since he's Madam Jang's right-hand man,

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:02.960
I asked him to keep an eye on things
and share information with us.

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:05.530
What if something happens to Tae Joo?

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:07.330
Madam Jang is incredibly sharp.

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:09.500
That's why I told him to be careful.

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.270
I told him it was okay to refuse
if it was too much,

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:13.940
but he said he'd do it.

00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:17.010
He said he wanted to stop
Madam Jang's rampage.

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:18.980
He really said that?

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:21.980
He even gave me a clear signal
on his way out.

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:27.480
Do you really think Tae Joo
will betray Madam Jang...

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:29.920
and come over to our side?

00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:32.290
I guess we'll just have to trust him.

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:35.090
Especially if he thinks
it's for her own good.

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:42.230
Oh my. Slow down, honey.

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:44.800
You're eating like
you haven't eaten in three days.

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:46.870
I told you
I didn't even get to eat breakfast.

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:49.040
So that so-called Manager Gong...

00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:52.440
just left for the whole day
without a single word,

00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:54.610
and you've been starving all day?
Is that it?

00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:58.080
That's what I said.
She's not even answering her phone.

00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:01.820
Why would she do that?
She was always on top of the housework.

00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:03.390
More than good.

00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:06.560
She was so responsible that
sometimes it felt like she ran the house,

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:08.090
not just worked in it.

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:10.330
I have no idea why she's acting
like this all of a sudden. Seriously.

00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:14.600
- Did she miss her pay?
- I doubt it. She makes six figures.

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:18.270
I think she's got a man.

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.940
What kind of crazy talk is that?

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:22.940
A man?

00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:25.210
Come on, what else could it be?

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:30.180
Considering she's completely
ditching her chores to be out all day.

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:33.780
Whatever the reason, I can't forgive her
for letting my daughter starve.

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:36.290
- Here, eat up.
- Hey, have some of the squash.

00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:38.520
- Right, the squash.
- The rolled omelet, too.

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:40.120
- And mushrooms.
- The rolled omelet.

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:41.760
And give her some of this meat.

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:43.560
Gosh, you give it to her. You do it.

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:46.130
Here, eat it yourself.
You're a big girl now.

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:49.270
And tell Ji Seop to come here later.

00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:51.900
Should I? I'll tell him to come here
after work then.

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:53.070
Good idea.

00:23:57.570 --> 00:24:00.010
To your parents' place?
All right, that sounds good.

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:01.710
I'll head right over when I'm done here.

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:05.480
Ja Kyung, I have to go.
Something urgent just came up.

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:08.790
Where have you been the past few days?

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:10.990
About that file we reviewed,

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:14.520
I've finished the legal analysis,
so you can go ahead with it.

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:17.090
I asked why you disappeared
for days without a word.

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:34.110
What are you doing here?

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:38.720
Baek Sul Hee.
You'd freak out if you knew,

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:41.020
but it's not a bad thing.
Just you wait.

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:45.320
Why are you staring at me like that?
State your business or get out.

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:47.090
I'm here for a reason.

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:50.730
The divorce papers
for Chairman Min Doo Sik and Jung Lucia.

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.200
I tore them up.

00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:57.530
I'm here to tell you
that your divorce is off.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.570
If you want to know why,

00:25:03.010 --> 00:25:06.180
meet me tonight at 7 p.m. at Berimang
by the Mucheon Roundabout.

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:07.410
But...

00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:09.310
you have to bring Se Ri with you.

00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:12.120
What does Se Ri have to do with this?

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:13.580
Make sure you bring her.

00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:15.490
If you show up alone,

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:17.850
I'll tell her everything
about who you really are.

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:30.500
Darn it. He has a million ways
to make my life difficult.

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:37.940
Maybe it's because
I haven't seen you in a few days,

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.680
but something about you
seems very different.

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:42.150
I do?

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:45.220
- Not at all.
- There's something I wanted to ask you.

00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:50.120
About the bouquet and engagement ring
you dropped on the rooftop that day.

00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:51.660
Oh, right.

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:53.490
Please, don't worry about it.

00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:56.090
It was nothing. I just did it
because it's what people do.

00:25:57.290 --> 00:25:59.360
Min Kyung Chae, it's over for you.

00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:03.030
No matter how great you think you are,
what can you be without my help?

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:06.170
And that high-and-mighty Madam Jang.

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:09.170
That old fox is only helping you
because she thinks Se Ri is...

00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:10.510
her son's flesh and blood.

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:13.410
What will happen when she finds out
Se Ri's my daughter?

00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:16.750
What are you thinking so hard about?

00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:19.220
It's nothing.

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:24.990
Meet me tonight at 7 p.m. at Berimang
by the Mucheon Roundabout.

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:27.560
But you have to bring Se Ri with you.

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:29.430
Make sure you bring her.

00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:31.330
If you show up alone,

00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:33.560
I'll tell her everything
about who you really are.

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:35.900
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:47.740
Se Ri.

00:26:49.210 --> 00:26:51.450
Can you meet me outside for a bit?

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:56.090
Come to the front of the company building.
We can go to the meeting from there.

00:26:56.790 --> 00:26:58.690
Are we meeting someone?

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:01.620
Yes.

00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:03.260
You'll see.

00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:11.270
Hello, are you Jung Lucia and Min Se Ri?

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:13.800
Yes, that's us.

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:16.570
Right this way.
I'll show you to the family table.

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:18.710
The family table?

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:21.810
Yes, he specifically requested
the family table.

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:23.980
He said this family dinner
was long overdue...

00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:26.580
and even gave us a tip to make it special.

00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:30.620
Your husband is right over there.

00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:32.990
He's been waiting eagerly
for his daughter.

00:27:56.180 --> 00:28:00.020
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:01.450
(The newborn was filmed
under supervision...)

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:02.690
(and with consideration
for their rest and safety.)

00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:20.540
