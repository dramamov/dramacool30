2025 NATURAL BEBE
NEW MOTHER TF TEAM RECRUITMENT INTERVIEW

00:00:59.497 --> 00:01:01.207
RESUME

00:01:01.291 --> 00:01:03.251
While raising my child, I felt…

00:01:05.461 --> 00:01:07.255
-I'm Park Seul-gi, a young mom.
-My family…

00:01:09.007 --> 00:01:11.885
GOOD LUCK, MOM

00:01:14.095 --> 00:01:18.516
I think I will excel
in new product development…

00:01:19.517 --> 00:01:21.644
Applicant 50, Ms. Kang Hui-ja,
we're ready for you.

00:01:34.115 --> 00:01:36.576
A crappy school only churns out
more crappy results.

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.786
It seems you gained a bit of weight.
You could use some upkeep.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.539
Kids like her
who grow up in unstable homes

00:01:41.623 --> 00:01:43.124
always end up getting into trouble.

00:02:04.771 --> 00:02:05.939
Da-rim.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.067
Sorry.

00:02:14.405 --> 00:02:15.782
I believe work is like that too.

00:02:15.865 --> 00:02:19.077
If you just push through
and charge ahead, one day,

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.411
you become strong.

00:02:21.204 --> 00:02:23.748
Right. It took me so much to get here.

00:02:24.457 --> 00:02:27.085
Go Da-rim, it's time for you to be strong.

00:02:27.627 --> 00:02:29.295
Applicant 51, Ms. Go Da-rim.

00:02:30.171 --> 00:02:31.506
We're ready for you.

00:02:33.258 --> 00:02:35.009
Yes, I'm coming.

00:02:44.477 --> 00:02:47.480
Hello. My name is Go Da-rim.

00:02:56.114 --> 00:02:57.991
INTERVIEWER

00:02:58.074 --> 00:02:59.575
Mr. Gong went to the restroom.

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:00.660
Should I go get him?

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:04.914
We can proceed without him.

00:03:06.165 --> 00:03:07.834
-Ms. Go Da-rim?
-Yes?

00:03:07.917 --> 00:03:08.835
Please take a seat.

00:03:08.918 --> 00:03:09.919
Yes, ma'am.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.714
Ji-hyeok!

00:03:14.215 --> 00:03:16.926
The interviews aren't done yet.
You can't leave already.

00:03:17.427 --> 00:03:19.053
Just let them hire whoever.

00:03:19.137 --> 00:03:20.555
They're all pathetic and hopeless.

00:03:21.055 --> 00:03:22.724
Picking one's poison is no easy feat.

00:03:22.807 --> 00:03:25.935
That's more reason for you to screen
to find the best candidates.

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.521
The chairman's got his eye
on the Mother TF Team.

00:03:28.604 --> 00:03:29.814
That's no TF team.

00:03:30.398 --> 00:03:32.859
It's just a fancy title
for intern training.

00:03:33.776 --> 00:03:35.903
It'll be gone in six months anyway.

00:03:35.987 --> 00:03:37.613
We'll also make our exit around then,

00:03:37.697 --> 00:03:39.032
so no need to fuss over it.

00:03:39.782 --> 00:03:40.616
Take it easy.

00:03:41.242 --> 00:03:42.368
I'm off.

00:03:48.666 --> 00:03:49.542
Nice to meet you.

00:03:49.625 --> 00:03:50.793
Hello.

00:03:51.878 --> 00:03:53.087
Does this university really exist?

00:03:54.797 --> 00:03:55.757
Don't be intimidated.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.383
You can't lose your footing
from the start.

00:03:58.593 --> 00:03:59.552
I know, right?

00:03:59.635 --> 00:04:02.472
I also discovered it while looking
for schools based on my scores,

00:04:02.555 --> 00:04:04.515
but I still studied hard while attending,

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:06.601
received a scholarship for all four years,

00:04:06.684 --> 00:04:07.727
and was a department rep.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.604
Better be the head of a dog

00:04:09.687 --> 00:04:11.147
than the tail of a lion, huh?

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.523
Right? The head of a dog?

00:04:13.524 --> 00:04:14.692
Pull yourself together.

00:04:14.776 --> 00:04:15.943
Remain positive.

00:04:16.027 --> 00:04:17.362
That's right. The head of a dog.

00:04:23.951 --> 00:04:25.203
I see.

00:04:25.286 --> 00:04:28.289
But you don't have
any other experiences after university.

00:04:28.373 --> 00:04:29.874
Basically, a blank piece of paper.

00:04:32.502 --> 00:04:35.129
That's exactly the reason
why you should hire me.

00:04:35.213 --> 00:04:37.507
You're right. I'm a blank piece of paper.

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.092
Without any prior work experience,

00:04:39.175 --> 00:04:41.928
I bring no biases and no skill set.

00:04:42.011 --> 00:04:43.346
If you hire me,

00:04:43.971 --> 00:04:46.015
I, Go Da-rim, will become the empty canvas

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:50.895
on which Natural BeBe
can draw whatever they wish.

00:04:50.978 --> 00:04:52.230
Everyone,

00:04:52.313 --> 00:04:55.108
feel free to draw on me
to your heart's content.

00:04:58.903 --> 00:05:00.988
We have a complete freak on our hands.

00:05:01.072 --> 00:05:02.407
Thank you for your time.

00:05:03.032 --> 00:05:03.991
Thank you.

00:05:05.368 --> 00:05:08.037
Overzealous with nothing to back it up.

00:05:08.704 --> 00:05:09.580
Perfect.

00:05:09.664 --> 00:05:11.541
INTERVIEWER: GONG JI-HYE
RESULT: PASS

00:05:30.935 --> 00:05:32.520
Easy, easy. Calm down.

00:05:33.146 --> 00:05:35.731
-What do you want?
-Not you. Your muscles.

00:05:36.357 --> 00:05:37.900
They're so worked up

00:05:37.984 --> 00:05:40.278
that all the women here
are only staring at you.

00:05:40.361 --> 00:05:41.946
I'm not in the mood to joke around.

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:43.239
I wasn't joking around.

00:05:43.322 --> 00:05:45.116
I don't like other women
staring at my man.

00:05:47.702 --> 00:05:48.870
I heard you settled it with your father.

00:05:49.537 --> 00:05:51.539
How could you not reach out to me?

00:05:51.622 --> 00:05:53.791
These chaebol children
and their lack of manners.

00:05:53.875 --> 00:05:55.168
It's such an issue.

00:05:56.002 --> 00:05:58.546
Let's talk.

00:06:03.134 --> 00:06:05.428
Sure, we'll get married.

00:06:05.511 --> 00:06:07.972
But there's something
you need to know before we do.

00:06:08.556 --> 00:06:12.602
Including me, everyone pushing
for this marriage has their own goal,

00:06:12.685 --> 00:06:14.228
but none of those goals

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:16.314
include love.

00:06:16.397 --> 00:06:18.941
It won't be the married life
you've been dreaming about.

00:06:19.525 --> 00:06:20.902
I'm sorry, but for me,

00:06:21.944 --> 00:06:23.738
this is just going to be a mating retreat.

00:06:23.821 --> 00:06:26.157
You shouldn't dismiss mating retreats.

00:06:27.283 --> 00:06:29.202
During a middle school class trip,

00:06:29.285 --> 00:06:31.078
I ended up dating the one
I was paired with.

00:06:31.162 --> 00:06:34.832
Sometimes, physical proximity
leads to emotional connection.

00:06:36.083 --> 00:06:37.251
You've never experienced it?

00:06:38.961 --> 00:06:39.795
What?

00:06:44.467 --> 00:06:46.594
Should we do that again?

00:06:46.677 --> 00:06:47.720
Sorry?

00:06:47.803 --> 00:06:49.597
Let's do that again.

00:07:01.192 --> 00:07:04.570
Not to mention, I'm being paired up
with the man I already called dibs on.

00:07:04.654 --> 00:07:05.613
I'll gladly accept.

00:07:05.696 --> 00:07:07.990
You say that like it's nothing.

00:07:08.074 --> 00:07:10.534
Do you even know me that well?

00:07:10.618 --> 00:07:14.247
I've dated my fair share of guys from
the most prestigious families in Korea.

00:07:15.206 --> 00:07:18.626
Right off the bat, it's a barrage of brags
about money, stocks, and connections.

00:07:18.709 --> 00:07:20.044
They're all so boring.

00:07:20.127 --> 00:07:22.213
But Gong Ji-hyeok is a bit different.

00:07:22.296 --> 00:07:25.258
His eyes light up
when he pursues his path.

00:07:26.842 --> 00:07:27.802
So sexy.

00:07:29.845 --> 00:07:30.846
That…

00:07:32.348 --> 00:07:33.474
Never mind. Forget it.

00:07:44.777 --> 00:07:45.778
What are you doing here?

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:47.280
Hey.

00:07:47.863 --> 00:07:48.906
The announcement is today.

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:51.033
Seeing that they haven't called me yet,

00:07:51.701 --> 00:07:52.827
I probably didn't get it, right?

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:55.538
You don't know that.
Just have some patience.

00:07:57.331 --> 00:07:59.750
I bombed that interview.

00:07:59.834 --> 00:08:01.752
I think I went overboard
and overcompensated.

00:08:06.924 --> 00:08:07.758
Hey, Da-rim.

00:08:07.842 --> 00:08:08.884
Yeah?

00:08:09.552 --> 00:08:10.428
Do you remember?

00:08:11.721 --> 00:08:12.555
Remember what?

00:08:13.472 --> 00:08:17.101
When the big guys at our school
would tease me about not having a mom,

00:08:17.643 --> 00:08:19.770
you'd fight them on my behalf
and console me.

00:08:20.813 --> 00:08:21.939
What about it?

00:08:22.023 --> 00:08:24.108
Back then, I couldn't even think
about fighting back

00:08:24.191 --> 00:08:26.527
because I was terrified
about how big they were,

00:08:27.361 --> 00:08:28.821
but you never gave in.

00:08:28.904 --> 00:08:30.197
You fought them until the end.

00:08:31.991 --> 00:08:34.118
Did I?

00:08:34.201 --> 00:08:35.036
You did.

00:08:35.119 --> 00:08:36.746
To me…

00:08:38.873 --> 00:08:40.166
you're awesome.

00:08:42.418 --> 00:08:46.339
Well, I know you might have
your moments of being a loser,

00:08:46.839 --> 00:08:50.009
but I also know you'll go back
to being awesome in no time.

00:08:53.429 --> 00:08:54.555
What's wrong with you?

00:08:55.181 --> 00:08:56.015
All right.

00:08:57.016 --> 00:08:58.976
Let's go now.
I'll make you something tasty.

00:09:01.937 --> 00:09:02.772
Thanks.

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:06.817
Hello?

00:09:08.486 --> 00:09:10.863
Yes, I'm Go Da-rim.

00:09:14.325 --> 00:09:15.868
Yes, I understand.

00:09:15.951 --> 00:09:17.495
Thank you so much.

00:09:17.578 --> 00:09:18.537
Thank you!

00:09:19.622 --> 00:09:21.666
-What happened?
-Seon-u!

00:09:21.749 --> 00:09:23.793
I got the job!

00:09:26.128 --> 00:09:28.422
This is unbelievable!

00:10:01.956 --> 00:10:02.957
You scared me.

00:10:03.541 --> 00:10:04.375
Sorry.

00:10:05.209 --> 00:10:06.794
What are you doing here?

00:10:06.877 --> 00:10:08.587
Didn't you say
today was your first day at work?

00:10:08.671 --> 00:10:13.050
You told me it was your dream to see me
get a job and go to work in the morning.

00:10:13.134 --> 00:10:14.301
That's why I'm here.

00:10:14.385 --> 00:10:15.928
Here. Take it all in.

00:10:18.264 --> 00:10:21.350
Hello. I'm Go Da-rim, the new hire.

00:10:23.185 --> 00:10:24.562
Don't fool around.

00:10:25.646 --> 00:10:27.606
Be sure to listen
to your senior colleagues.

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:29.734
Do everything with integrity.

00:10:30.568 --> 00:10:31.485
Got it?

00:10:32.611 --> 00:10:34.488
With integrity…

00:10:35.281 --> 00:10:37.158
Of course, I will.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.994
You probably skipped breakfast.

00:10:40.536 --> 00:10:41.620
Hold on.

00:10:44.623 --> 00:10:46.834
At least have some of this on your way.

00:10:46.917 --> 00:10:49.086
You need a full stomach to work.

00:10:54.675 --> 00:10:55.509
Mom.

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:59.930
I'll do whatever I must
to get through this six-month internship

00:11:00.723 --> 00:11:02.349
and secure a full-time position.

00:11:02.433 --> 00:11:04.185
Just wait and see. Okay?

00:11:04.268 --> 00:11:05.644
You're going to do great.

00:11:08.606 --> 00:11:10.691
Wait, what time does work start?

00:11:10.775 --> 00:11:12.026
Oh, right.

00:11:12.109 --> 00:11:13.778
-Don't forget this.
-Okay. I need to get going.

00:11:14.695 --> 00:11:16.197
-Chew thoroughly when you eat.
-Okay.

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:18.824
-All right, Mom. I'll call you.
-Okay. Go.

00:11:18.908 --> 00:11:20.159
-Go.
-I'm going.

00:11:23.579 --> 00:11:24.455
Go Da-rim.

00:11:24.997 --> 00:11:27.875
Starting today, you're a married woman.

00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:31.378
You have a husband and a 6-year-old kid.

00:11:32.213 --> 00:11:33.839
You must never forget that

00:11:33.923 --> 00:11:35.382
under any circumstances.

00:11:43.849 --> 00:11:45.768
You can do this.

00:11:50.523 --> 00:11:51.941
I'm not just saying this
because he's my son,

00:11:52.024 --> 00:11:54.401
but he's exceptionally bright,
so I'm sure he'll be an asset.

00:11:55.653 --> 00:11:56.820
Please help him out.

00:11:56.904 --> 00:11:57.738
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:08.874
You all skipped breakfast, right?
Here, have some.

00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.626
Ta-da!

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:14.255
I steamed glutinous rice cakes
and sweet potatoes.

00:12:14.797 --> 00:12:15.631
Here.

00:12:17.132 --> 00:12:17.967
Thank you.

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:19.051
You're welcome.

00:12:21.095 --> 00:12:22.805
What's that smell?

00:12:22.888 --> 00:12:23.847
Oh no, my radish water kimchi.

00:12:23.931 --> 00:12:26.517
I told that damn man to screw it on tight.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:27.560
-He's so useless.
-Here, take this.

00:12:27.643 --> 00:12:28.894
I'm so sick of him.

00:12:30.938 --> 00:12:32.022
I'm talking about the man I live with.

00:12:32.106 --> 00:12:34.775
But are we allowed to eat
stuff like this in the office?

00:12:34.858 --> 00:12:37.236
Why not? Everyone eats and poops.

00:12:38.779 --> 00:12:40.114
I guess you're right.

00:12:40.197 --> 00:12:41.115
Oh my.

00:12:42.116 --> 00:12:43.325
What is that?

00:12:47.121 --> 00:12:48.122
This is unbelievable.

00:12:48.205 --> 00:12:50.541
I absolutely love sweet potatoes.

00:12:50.624 --> 00:12:52.710
My goodness. Did you bring these?

00:12:52.793 --> 00:12:54.336
Try some. They're out of this world.

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:57.047
Oh my, golden sweet potatoes!

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:00.259
You have to try some.

00:13:01.594 --> 00:13:03.387
You two must be friends.

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:04.471
-No, we've just met.
-No, we've just met.

00:13:04.555 --> 00:13:05.472
What?

00:13:06.974 --> 00:13:08.017
Who cares?

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:09.268
But you're my type of girl.

00:13:09.351 --> 00:13:10.436
-So are you.
-Listen up.

00:13:11.145 --> 00:13:14.440
Everyone, the director
and the new team leader…

00:13:15.608 --> 00:13:16.525
What's that smell?

00:13:16.609 --> 00:13:18.527
Did someone make kimchi in the office?

00:13:18.611 --> 00:13:20.613
There's no kimchi, but we have something
that goes perfectly with it.

00:13:20.696 --> 00:13:23.616
Golden sweet potatoes.

00:13:34.168 --> 00:13:35.586
Here they come.

00:13:36.462 --> 00:13:37.463
Say hello.

00:13:37.546 --> 00:13:39.590
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:14:18.796 --> 00:14:19.797
Now,

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:22.508
let me introduce
the leader of the Mother TF Team.

00:14:22.591 --> 00:14:24.134
Mr. Gong Ji-hyeok.

00:14:24.718 --> 00:14:25.928
Team leader?

00:14:26.011 --> 00:14:30.057
This is a TF team comprised of mothers
with children under 6 years old.

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:31.058
"Mothers"?

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:41.110
The Mother TF Team was created
under special orders from the chairman

00:14:41.193 --> 00:14:42.277
with high expectations.

00:14:42.361 --> 00:14:43.988
After six months,

00:14:44.071 --> 00:14:46.156
we're looking to offer permanent positions
based on achievement.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.075
So please, give it your all.

00:14:48.158 --> 00:14:50.244
-Of course!
-I look forward to working with you.

00:14:50.327 --> 00:14:51.412
I'll do my very best.

00:14:52.746 --> 00:14:54.915
Mr. Gong,
would you like to say a few words?

00:15:01.296 --> 00:15:03.465
Mr. Gong, please say a few words
to the team.

00:15:03.549 --> 00:15:04.383
Right.

00:15:07.761 --> 00:15:11.974
So, are you saying
everyone here is married

00:15:12.558 --> 00:15:14.601
with a kid at home?

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:17.771
Every single one of you?

00:15:18.355 --> 00:15:19.648
Yes, that was a job requirement.

00:15:19.732 --> 00:15:23.694
I'm sure at first glance,
we may all look like single young ladies.

00:15:23.777 --> 00:15:27.239
But surprisingly enough,
we are indeed all mothers with children.

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:29.616
I actually have three kids.

00:15:30.951 --> 00:15:31.869
You there.

00:15:32.828 --> 00:15:33.662
What about you?

00:15:34.329 --> 00:15:35.164
Me?

00:15:35.831 --> 00:15:37.207
I…

00:15:48.802 --> 00:15:50.179
Of course, I do.

00:15:50.262 --> 00:15:52.931
I have a child.

00:15:55.517 --> 00:15:56.477
I see.

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:13.619
It appears Mr. Gong
is in quite a jovial mood today.

00:16:15.496 --> 00:16:19.333
Mr. Ma, I believe we have
welcome gifts for the new hires.

00:16:19.416 --> 00:16:20.667
-Grab them from the general affairs team.
-Yes, ma'am.

00:16:20.751 --> 00:16:21.835
No!

00:16:21.919 --> 00:16:24.296
I can go and get them.

00:16:30.719 --> 00:16:31.553
What's going on?

00:16:32.179 --> 00:16:34.098
Why is that man here?

00:16:34.807 --> 00:16:37.059
He said he was a consultant
with his own business!

00:16:38.102 --> 00:16:39.853
This is just driving me crazy!

00:16:55.577 --> 00:16:57.162
Your husband is the same age as you,

00:16:58.956 --> 00:17:00.124
and your son is 6.

00:17:01.208 --> 00:17:03.502
You wrote on your application
in great detail

00:17:04.002 --> 00:17:06.672
that you wish to utilize
your motherhood know-how

00:17:06.755 --> 00:17:09.216
to realize your once forgotten potential.

00:17:09.299 --> 00:17:10.175
Is that correct?

00:17:10.843 --> 00:17:12.803
-I'm sorry.
-"Sorry"?

00:17:14.847 --> 00:17:15.931
You're sorry?

00:17:21.645 --> 00:17:23.438
I'm beyond speechless.

00:17:28.986 --> 00:17:29.820
Tell me.

00:17:30.404 --> 00:17:33.490
Why did you tell me
you didn't have a boyfriend?

00:17:33.574 --> 00:17:35.617
What? When did I…

00:17:35.701 --> 00:17:36.702
Yeah, I lost my mind.

00:17:36.785 --> 00:17:37.953
That's not all.

00:17:38.036 --> 00:17:40.706
I also have no money,
no boyfriend, and no dad.

00:17:40.789 --> 00:17:41.707
So what?

00:17:42.708 --> 00:17:45.752
Technically, I don't have a boyfriend.

00:17:45.836 --> 00:17:47.588
I have a husband.

00:17:47.671 --> 00:17:48.672
You can't be serious.

00:17:54.136 --> 00:17:55.095
What's your deal?

00:17:55.179 --> 00:17:57.431
You have a kid and a husband,
and you kissed…

00:18:00.309 --> 00:18:01.476
Okay.

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:02.561
Okay!

00:18:03.061 --> 00:18:03.979
Putting that aside,

00:18:04.563 --> 00:18:06.315
why did you agree to our date?

00:18:07.733 --> 00:18:09.484
That day, we almost…

00:18:10.569 --> 00:18:11.695
We almost…

00:18:14.156 --> 00:18:15.699
What were you even thinking?

00:18:16.366 --> 00:18:18.160
You see, the thing is…

00:18:19.828 --> 00:18:21.079
After a fight with my husband,

00:18:21.163 --> 00:18:22.789
I went to Jeju in a fit of rage.

00:18:22.873 --> 00:18:25.250
It had been a while
since I'd gone on a trip without my kid,

00:18:25.334 --> 00:18:26.251
so I got excited.

00:18:26.335 --> 00:18:27.419
And before I knew it,

00:18:27.502 --> 00:18:31.173
I had been swept up
by the thrill of the moment, and…

00:18:32.799 --> 00:18:35.677
If I'm being honest,
I've been a hermit for the last few years.

00:18:35.761 --> 00:18:38.513
Family issues basically pushed me
into taking this trip as well.

00:18:39.223 --> 00:18:40.849
So, the "family issues" you mentioned

00:18:42.267 --> 00:18:43.769
were marital quarrels?

00:18:44.394 --> 00:18:46.605
And you were a "hermit"

00:18:47.189 --> 00:18:48.273
because of child rearing?

00:18:48.357 --> 00:18:49.191
Yes, that's right.

00:18:49.274 --> 00:18:52.903
I must've suffered
some sort of temporary insanity in Jeju.

00:18:52.986 --> 00:18:54.529
I see.

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:57.491
So that's why you ran away.

00:18:58.325 --> 00:19:00.410
I guess the bed felt too real, huh?

00:19:01.495 --> 00:19:03.288
Was that it? Was it?

00:19:05.123 --> 00:19:06.500
Who are you people?

00:19:06.583 --> 00:19:08.168
You can't just come up here.

00:19:08.252 --> 00:19:09.086
Go downstairs now.

00:19:09.169 --> 00:19:10.712
Okay. Sorry!

00:19:10.796 --> 00:19:13.131
He's telling us to go down.

00:19:19.471 --> 00:19:20.847
Are you sure about these?

00:19:21.598 --> 00:19:23.600
Has my discerning eye ever led you astray?

00:19:24.184 --> 00:19:27.020
Just wait a year.
They'll be worth ten times as much.

00:19:27.813 --> 00:19:29.106
Hello, Father.

00:19:29.189 --> 00:19:30.649
Why are you so busy?

00:19:30.732 --> 00:19:31.650
I apologize.

00:19:31.733 --> 00:19:33.568
I was at a meeting
for my upcoming photography exhibit--

00:19:33.652 --> 00:19:35.279
Will that make any money?

00:19:37.281 --> 00:19:39.324
It'll be a warm invitation
to the general public--

00:19:39.408 --> 00:19:41.285
Why invite them in?

00:19:41.368 --> 00:19:44.579
Is this some neighborhood corner shop
open to anyone and everyone?

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:48.292
Just behave yourself and get married.

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:08.228
So far, Kim Seon-u's work
seems to have the most mass appeal.

00:20:08.312 --> 00:20:09.396
Is he still unreachable?

00:20:09.479 --> 00:20:11.857
We actually managed to reach him
this morning.

00:20:12.482 --> 00:20:13.317
What did he say?

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.193
He turned us down without hesitation.

00:20:15.777 --> 00:20:18.697
He's busy running his baby studio
and isn't interested in creative work.

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:26.913
Send me his address.

00:20:27.581 --> 00:20:28.415
Sure.

00:20:32.336 --> 00:20:33.170
There.

00:20:34.338 --> 00:20:35.297
Oh my.

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:38.550
Now it really feels like I'm working here.

00:20:38.633 --> 00:20:40.260
Oh no. Jin-hui, are you crying?

00:20:40.344 --> 00:20:44.014
After just being referred to
as "Eun-sang's mom" for so long,

00:20:44.097 --> 00:20:47.017
seeing my name "Jang Jin-hui"
just makes me…

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:49.936
I'm getting emotional
seeing it printed like this.

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:51.438
Right, Da-rim?

00:20:52.939 --> 00:20:54.316
See? This just proves my point.

00:20:54.399 --> 00:20:56.735
She has completely forgotten her own name.

00:20:56.818 --> 00:20:58.779
-Ms. Go Da-rim.
-Yes?

00:20:58.862 --> 00:20:59.946
What did you say?

00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:01.948
We were talking about
how our IDs make us feel.

00:21:02.032 --> 00:21:02.908
Right.

00:21:04.326 --> 00:21:06.495
I'm happy, very happy.

00:21:07.996 --> 00:21:10.457
I can't even describe
how desperately I wanted this.

00:21:10.999 --> 00:21:14.378
Should we take a picture to commemorate
the reclaiming of our names?

00:21:14.461 --> 00:21:15.379
That's a great idea.

00:21:15.462 --> 00:21:17.005
-I'll take it for you.
-Yes, please.

00:21:17.089 --> 00:21:19.257
Thank you very much, Mr. Kang.

00:21:19.341 --> 00:21:21.426
One, two, three.

00:21:22.886 --> 00:21:23.720
One more.

00:21:24.638 --> 00:21:25.931
Mr. Gong!

00:21:26.515 --> 00:21:28.225
Goodness, Mr. Gong!

00:21:28.308 --> 00:21:31.019
We're taking pictures. You should join us.

00:21:31.103 --> 00:21:32.521
-Come on, let's take one together.
-Please?

00:21:32.604 --> 00:21:34.064
Come on. Please.

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:43.365
Forget pictures.

00:21:44.783 --> 00:21:46.284
Let me say this as the team leader.

00:21:48.036 --> 00:21:49.496
I conducted a complete assessment

00:21:49.579 --> 00:21:52.582
of your abilities
through your resumes and interviews.

00:21:52.666 --> 00:21:53.959
That's to say,

00:21:54.668 --> 00:21:58.130
I don't expect a single thing
from any of you.

00:22:01.007 --> 00:22:04.219
Eat, hang out, relax, kill time,
or whatever for the next six months.

00:22:05.262 --> 00:22:06.096
However,

00:22:06.805 --> 00:22:07.722
just make sure

00:22:09.349 --> 00:22:10.684
not to

00:22:12.018 --> 00:22:12.853
bother me.

00:22:14.062 --> 00:22:14.896
That's all.

00:22:18.608 --> 00:22:19.609
Excuse me.

00:22:22.946 --> 00:22:25.240
What's wrong with him?
Is he having a bad day?

00:22:25.323 --> 00:22:26.491
Why complain?

00:22:26.575 --> 00:22:28.201
We can do anything we want.

00:22:28.285 --> 00:22:30.162
Isn't this great news for us?

00:22:30.245 --> 00:22:31.246
No.

00:22:31.329 --> 00:22:32.372
What's gotten into him?

00:22:35.417 --> 00:22:37.210
JUN BABY STUDIO

00:22:41.798 --> 00:22:42.674
Is this it?

00:22:42.757 --> 00:22:45.802
All right, look over here.

00:22:45.886 --> 00:22:47.470
That's it.

00:22:48.471 --> 00:22:49.931
That's nice.

00:22:50.849 --> 00:22:52.809
Look over here.

00:22:53.518 --> 00:22:55.520
You're doing great.

00:22:56.605 --> 00:22:58.773
My goodness, you look like a prince.

00:22:59.274 --> 00:23:00.358
Over here, Jae-hui.

00:23:03.862 --> 00:23:05.238
All right, Jae-hui.

00:23:05.322 --> 00:23:07.240
Should we play with the dinosaur now?

00:23:07.324 --> 00:23:09.284
Roar for me like this. Can you do that?

00:23:09.367 --> 00:23:11.703
Okay, here comes the dinosaur.

00:23:11.786 --> 00:23:13.872
Here it comes.

00:23:16.875 --> 00:23:18.043
Maybe something like this?

00:23:18.126 --> 00:23:18.960
Or…

00:23:19.628 --> 00:23:20.670
Like this?

00:23:46.988 --> 00:23:48.448
Can I help you?

00:23:48.531 --> 00:23:50.450
I'm Deputy Director Yu Ha-yeong
of Taeyu Art Hall.

00:23:52.869 --> 00:23:54.079
Why don't we talk inside?

00:23:54.663 --> 00:23:56.122
No, please sit.

00:23:56.206 --> 00:23:57.207
The weather's nice.

00:23:58.750 --> 00:23:59.834
You must've waited long.

00:23:59.918 --> 00:24:01.711
Well, I showed up unannounced.

00:24:02.295 --> 00:24:04.422
And I wasn't bored at all.

00:24:04.506 --> 00:24:06.341
I was busy watching you.

00:24:06.424 --> 00:24:08.051
-Pardon?
-Earlier, you were like…

00:24:10.178 --> 00:24:13.139
-What brings you here today?
-Oh, right.

00:24:14.724 --> 00:24:15.642
Well…

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:19.938
I'm here because of this piece.

00:24:20.522 --> 00:24:22.440
She looks so happy.

00:24:22.524 --> 00:24:24.192
I grew envious of her,

00:24:24.276 --> 00:24:27.404
and I grew really curious
about the photographer behind the camera.

00:24:27.487 --> 00:24:30.657
But I figured it out as soon as I saw you.

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:32.951
This is your girlfriend, right?

00:24:33.952 --> 00:24:37.872
You can tell by her eyes
that she's obviously very loved.

00:24:37.956 --> 00:24:40.959
I'd like to feature this as the main piece
of our upcoming exhibition.

00:24:41.042 --> 00:24:43.253
-I'm not interested.
-Why not?

00:24:44.462 --> 00:24:45.338
Did you two break up?

00:24:46.965 --> 00:24:48.341
Don't worry about that.

00:24:48.425 --> 00:24:49.801
We'll take care of everything.

00:24:49.884 --> 00:24:52.262
We'll reach out to your ex
and get her permission.

00:24:52.345 --> 00:24:54.055
-If you just give me her number--
-No.

00:24:54.681 --> 00:24:57.309
You can't get her permission,
and I don't know her number either.

00:24:57.392 --> 00:24:59.019
It sounds like it was a bad breakup.

00:24:59.644 --> 00:25:00.687
Why? What was it?

00:25:01.813 --> 00:25:03.481
Tell me. What happened?

00:25:07.819 --> 00:25:08.862
All right.

00:25:09.571 --> 00:25:12.532
Then, do you have any other pieces
besides this one?

00:25:12.615 --> 00:25:13.450
I don't.

00:25:14.409 --> 00:25:17.203
As you can see, I'm busy making a living.

00:25:17.287 --> 00:25:19.289
I'm sorry to say this
when you came all this way.

00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:24.586
I'm certain this will be
a great opportunity for you--

00:25:24.669 --> 00:25:25.670
I have somewhere to be.

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:28.548
Okay.

00:25:30.133 --> 00:25:31.593
Wait, hold on.

00:25:33.094 --> 00:25:35.764
If, by any chance,
you change your mind, call me.

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:40.477
The one thing I can guarantee
is that we'll treat you

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:43.146
with the utmost respect and courtesy
as an artist.

00:25:48.026 --> 00:25:48.860
Oh my.

00:25:48.943 --> 00:25:51.237
Tapping this is pretty fun.

00:25:51.321 --> 00:25:52.572
Do you smell the air of freedom?

00:25:52.655 --> 00:25:54.199
Clocking out for the day feels nice,
doesn't it?

00:25:54.282 --> 00:25:57.285
What's there to be happy about?
We clock out here and clock in at home.

00:25:57.369 --> 00:25:58.828
I'm already tired.

00:25:58.912 --> 00:25:59.871
Don't you agree?

00:26:00.413 --> 00:26:01.373
Pardon?

00:26:02.624 --> 00:26:03.583
Are you okay?

00:26:05.668 --> 00:26:08.296
Just thinking about cleaning
and making dinner has her out of it.

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:09.464
You're totally right!

00:26:10.298 --> 00:26:11.383
Pull yourself together.

00:26:12.008 --> 00:26:13.718
Right. You're so right.

00:26:14.594 --> 00:26:16.221
I have to go this way.

00:26:16.304 --> 00:26:18.098
-I'll say goodbye here. See you tomorrow.
-All right.

00:26:18.181 --> 00:26:20.141
-Okay. Good work today.
-Bye.

00:26:20.225 --> 00:26:21.059
See you tomorrow.

00:26:21.142 --> 00:26:22.519
What are you making for dinner?

00:26:22.602 --> 00:26:25.355
Whatever we have in the house.

00:26:39.786 --> 00:26:41.329
I sincerely apologize.

00:26:41.413 --> 00:26:43.706
You can curse me out, and I won't refute.

00:26:45.291 --> 00:26:46.876
Listen.

00:26:47.585 --> 00:26:49.421
I know this sounds shameless,

00:26:50.422 --> 00:26:51.673
but could you possibly keep

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:55.093
what happened in Jeju a secret?

00:26:55.176 --> 00:26:56.845
That's a given.

00:26:57.595 --> 00:26:59.013
That's a relief.

00:26:59.097 --> 00:27:00.223
Thank you so much.

00:27:00.306 --> 00:27:02.392
I was terrified the whole day
for no reason, and--

00:27:02.475 --> 00:27:04.561
Because you'll quit tomorrow.

00:27:05.603 --> 00:27:06.521
Sorry?

00:27:06.604 --> 00:27:07.522
Do you expect me

00:27:08.148 --> 00:27:11.151
to work with someone
who has deceived and manipulated me?

00:27:12.735 --> 00:27:15.405
You must take responsibility
for your actions.

00:27:18.324 --> 00:27:21.536
There's nothing more to discuss.
Hand in your resignation.

00:27:22.704 --> 00:27:23.663
By tomorrow morning.

00:27:27.625 --> 00:27:28.918
Mr. Gong!

00:27:29.002 --> 00:27:30.295
Hold on, Mr. Gong.

00:27:30.378 --> 00:27:32.380
Wait. Just a second.

00:27:33.047 --> 00:27:35.508
Sorry about that.

00:27:36.801 --> 00:27:39.471
I completely understand that you're mad,

00:27:40.013 --> 00:27:41.222
but I can't resign.

00:27:42.348 --> 00:27:45.393
I'm in a situation
where I need to make money.

00:27:49.189 --> 00:27:50.857
You do whatever you want…

00:27:52.942 --> 00:27:54.194
and ask for my understanding?

00:27:55.403 --> 00:27:56.237
Does that make sense?

00:27:58.114 --> 00:27:59.491
Do you know how worried I was?

00:28:05.163 --> 00:28:06.789
I didn't know if you were being chased

00:28:07.457 --> 00:28:08.791
or had gotten into some sort of accident.

00:28:10.502 --> 00:28:12.378
Do you know how hard I searched for you?

00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:15.965
You searched?

00:28:16.049 --> 00:28:17.342
For me?

00:28:23.223 --> 00:28:25.892
Forget all that.
Just hand in your resignation by tomorrow.

00:28:51.584 --> 00:28:55.088
This is a TF team comprised of mothers
with children under 6 years old.

00:28:55.171 --> 00:28:57.590
So, are you saying
everyone here is married

00:28:57.674 --> 00:28:59.801
with a kid at home?

00:29:00.426 --> 00:29:02.136
Of course, I do. I have a child.

00:29:11.813 --> 00:29:14.774
Jeez, you're sighing
like the world is ending.

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:18.444
Who drinks alone
to celebrate their first day of work?

00:29:19.445 --> 00:29:20.905
How did you know to come here?

00:29:20.989 --> 00:29:24.576
I just had a feeling you'd be here.

00:29:25.159 --> 00:29:26.452
-Here you go.
-Hello.

00:29:26.536 --> 00:29:29.080
You seemed down all day at work.

00:29:29.831 --> 00:29:30.874
Did something happen?

00:29:33.459 --> 00:29:34.294
Look at you.

00:29:34.878 --> 00:29:36.462
I guess something did happen.

00:29:38.298 --> 00:29:39.340
You know,

00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:41.509
the woman from Jeju Island?

00:29:41.593 --> 00:29:43.136
Oh, your dynamite kiss?

00:29:43.887 --> 00:29:44.721
Did you find her?

00:29:45.388 --> 00:29:46.764
It turns out she's married.

00:29:46.848 --> 00:29:48.099
What?

00:29:49.475 --> 00:29:50.602
She's married?

00:29:51.728 --> 00:29:53.021
She also has a son.

00:29:53.771 --> 00:29:55.189
A son?

00:29:55.273 --> 00:29:56.774
That's insane.

00:29:56.858 --> 00:29:58.026
What kind of woman does that?

00:30:01.696 --> 00:30:05.909
Ji-hyeok, just drink this
and forget about the whole thing.

00:30:10.622 --> 00:30:11.497
I should.

00:30:16.127 --> 00:30:19.505
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

00:30:21.466 --> 00:30:23.134
Do you know how worried I was?

00:30:23.217 --> 00:30:24.928
I didn't know if you were being chased

00:30:25.803 --> 00:30:27.138
or had gotten into some sort of accident.

00:30:28.723 --> 00:30:31.017
Do you know how hard I searched for you?

00:30:34.354 --> 00:30:36.856
I was the one who messed up
in the first place.

00:30:38.691 --> 00:30:40.109
I just got punished, that's all.

00:30:50.954 --> 00:30:52.914
At least have some of this on your way.

00:30:53.456 --> 00:30:56.376
You need a full stomach to work.

00:30:58.711 --> 00:30:59.837
Mom…

00:31:05.677 --> 00:31:06.511
Yeah.

00:31:07.387 --> 00:31:08.888
I need to think about my mom first.

00:31:09.597 --> 00:31:11.891
Embarrassment? Awkwardness?

00:31:11.975 --> 00:31:13.309
Who cares about any of that?

00:31:14.769 --> 00:31:16.062
I can endure it all.

00:31:28.825 --> 00:31:30.910
My goodness! You're here, Mr. Gong!

00:31:30.994 --> 00:31:32.996
-Good morning, Mr. Gong.
-Hello.

00:31:39.085 --> 00:31:40.169
He's saying hi to just one person.

00:31:40.253 --> 00:31:41.754
Let's get back to work.

00:31:44.757 --> 00:31:45.842
Ms. Go Da-rim.

00:31:46.342 --> 00:31:48.302
Bring what we discussed yesterday
to my office.

00:31:55.643 --> 00:31:56.644
For your morning coffee,

00:31:56.728 --> 00:31:58.938
I prepared an iced Americano.

00:31:59.022 --> 00:32:01.399
I don't believe this is what I asked for.

00:32:02.358 --> 00:32:03.484
Plan A.

00:32:04.819 --> 00:32:07.447
Mr. Gong, I beg you.

00:32:07.947 --> 00:32:10.908
Please allow me to work here.

00:32:10.992 --> 00:32:12.618
I have nowhere else to go,

00:32:12.702 --> 00:32:14.203
and I worked hard to get in here.

00:32:14.287 --> 00:32:18.041
Could you possibly
just let it all slide this one time?

00:32:18.916 --> 00:32:20.126
Are you kidding me right now?

00:32:20.209 --> 00:32:21.919
What I mean is…

00:32:22.754 --> 00:32:25.882
We should separate
our professional and personal lives.

00:32:28.217 --> 00:32:29.427
Let's be honest.

00:32:29.927 --> 00:32:31.888
We weren't anything serious anyway.

00:32:31.971 --> 00:32:35.224
Anyone could make such a mistake
as they make their way through life.

00:32:36.392 --> 00:32:39.312
Let's just consider it a sort of accident,

00:32:39.395 --> 00:32:41.355
shake it off, and forget about it.

00:32:41.439 --> 00:32:42.398
What do you say?

00:32:44.192 --> 00:32:45.359
"A mistake."

00:32:45.443 --> 00:32:46.778
"A sort of accident."

00:32:46.861 --> 00:32:47.945
Yes.

00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:50.490
"Just shake it off and forget it"?

00:32:53.785 --> 00:32:57.038
I guess things in life
are always that easy for you.

00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:00.291
How commendable.

00:33:03.086 --> 00:33:04.420
It's not working.

00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:07.256
All right, Plan B.

00:33:08.382 --> 00:33:10.468
Oh my. Then, by any chance,

00:33:10.551 --> 00:33:13.554
are you doing this
because our kiss was so unforgettable?

00:33:16.891 --> 00:33:17.725
What did you say?

00:33:17.809 --> 00:33:19.769
You are. I'm right. That's it.

00:33:19.852 --> 00:33:22.980
I totally understand.
It's completely understandable.

00:33:23.064 --> 00:33:26.067
You see, I have a bit of expertise
when it comes to kissing.

00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:28.694
I unintentionally encounter
such predicaments on occasion.

00:33:29.612 --> 00:33:30.696
Have you lost your mind?

00:33:31.322 --> 00:33:32.657
Are you on something?

00:33:33.658 --> 00:33:34.659
Is that it?

00:33:34.742 --> 00:33:36.494
If it's not that…

00:33:38.329 --> 00:33:40.164
I know it's difficult,
but please let it go.

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:43.292
In turn, I'll work really hard.

00:33:43.376 --> 00:33:46.129
I'll do whatever you say
as long as it's not a resignation.

00:33:46.212 --> 00:33:47.046
I swear.

00:33:48.422 --> 00:33:50.174
-I…
-Yes?

00:33:51.759 --> 00:33:53.803
-I…
-Yes?

00:33:56.556 --> 00:33:58.808
I find your very existence uncomfortable.

00:34:02.603 --> 00:34:04.564
I'm done with your nonsense.

00:34:07.441 --> 00:34:08.401
Get lost.

00:34:13.906 --> 00:34:15.324
I refuse to get lost!

00:34:17.326 --> 00:34:19.370
-You refuse?
-No! I won't get lost.

00:34:19.453 --> 00:34:22.039
Just go ahead and fire me if you want.
But on what grounds?

00:34:22.123 --> 00:34:24.750
"I had a mind-blowing kiss
with this woman in Jeju."

00:34:24.834 --> 00:34:25.793
Will you cite that?

00:34:51.152 --> 00:34:54.822
TEAM LEADER GONG JI-HYEOK

00:35:11.130 --> 00:35:12.757
This is how you're going to play it, huh?

00:35:14.967 --> 00:35:17.053
Team Leader Kim Seung-gyu.

00:35:17.136 --> 00:35:21.140
This is Team Leader Gong Ji-hyeok
of the Mother TF Team.

00:35:21.224 --> 00:35:22.099
Nice to meet you.

00:35:23.017 --> 00:35:26.437
These are the new products
we thoroughly prepared for this season.

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:27.605
Before they're released,

00:35:27.688 --> 00:35:30.524
we were hoping for the Mother TF Team
to review them for us.

00:35:31.108 --> 00:35:32.193
The products feature--

00:35:32.276 --> 00:35:33.611
That won't be necessary.

00:35:34.779 --> 00:35:36.364
They'll know once they try them.

00:35:37.365 --> 00:35:38.658
Pack them up. Let's go.

00:35:39.867 --> 00:35:41.244
Mr. Gong.

00:35:41.327 --> 00:35:42.161
What?

00:35:43.162 --> 00:35:44.497
Use your words. What?

00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:48.209
He just has a funny way with words.

00:35:48.292 --> 00:35:50.378
Sir, the lab just reached out regarding
the bottle boiling sterilization test.

00:35:50.461 --> 00:35:54.298
-They can't do it this week.
-Ji-hyeok, we're just getting started.

00:35:54.382 --> 00:35:56.008
Then we'll need to find an external lab.

00:35:56.092 --> 00:35:57.468
It'll require five all-nighters.

00:35:57.551 --> 00:35:59.595
Who would agree to that
on such short notice?

00:36:00.388 --> 00:36:01.222
Five all-nighters?

00:36:01.305 --> 00:36:03.641
I'll do whatever you say
as long as it's not a resignation.

00:36:03.724 --> 00:36:04.558
I swear.

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:10.064
Us!

00:36:13.859 --> 00:36:15.236
My goodness.

00:36:16.279 --> 00:36:17.655
We'll do it.

00:36:17.738 --> 00:36:18.698
Pardon?

00:36:20.574 --> 00:36:21.867
Just trust us and leave it to us.

00:36:22.618 --> 00:36:24.495
We can do an incredible job.

00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:30.167
Man, Mr. Gong is quite an ambitious one.

00:36:30.251 --> 00:36:32.753
The development team was in trouble,

00:36:32.837 --> 00:36:34.755
and he stepped forward
and said, "We'll do it!"

00:36:35.339 --> 00:36:38.968
I guess he's trying to make a big impact
by doing something major.

00:36:43.973 --> 00:36:44.932
Mr. Ma.

00:36:47.226 --> 00:36:48.519
You'll be working late tonight.

00:37:02.325 --> 00:37:03.242
So you're saying

00:37:03.326 --> 00:37:05.411
I need to dip baby bottles
in boiling water

00:37:05.494 --> 00:37:08.080
for five whole days straight?

00:37:08.164 --> 00:37:10.750
That's right. We're testing
to see if the bottles shrink

00:37:10.833 --> 00:37:12.376
when sterilized in boiling water.

00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:15.504
For 30 seconds, every 30 minutes.
180 times in total.

00:37:15.588 --> 00:37:16.797
Be sure to promptly record

00:37:16.881 --> 00:37:20.259
any changes in height,
weight, and circumference.

00:37:21.677 --> 00:37:24.722
But why do we need to do that out here?

00:37:24.805 --> 00:37:26.599
There's no lab available at the moment.

00:37:26.682 --> 00:37:28.851
And we can't just do it in any room.

00:37:30.436 --> 00:37:31.687
It's a fire hazard.

00:37:31.771 --> 00:37:33.439
Then, what about at night?

00:37:33.522 --> 00:37:35.775
I won't have to do it alone, right?

00:37:37.109 --> 00:37:39.028
Why? You can't do it?

00:37:39.862 --> 00:37:43.741
Didn't you say you'd do anything
as long as it wasn't a resignation?

00:37:44.784 --> 00:37:45.701
Right.

00:37:47.078 --> 00:37:49.538
That could've been a lie as well.

00:37:49.622 --> 00:37:51.165
No, I meant that.

00:37:51.248 --> 00:37:53.084
But this is a bit…

00:37:53.167 --> 00:37:56.045
It's just one lie after another with you.

00:38:01.717 --> 00:38:03.511
If you can't do it,
then just hand in your resignation

00:38:03.594 --> 00:38:04.887
and leave.

00:38:06.847 --> 00:38:09.475
No, wait. I'll do it.

00:38:17.858 --> 00:38:19.235
All this over a measly kiss.

00:38:22.988 --> 00:38:23.823
What was that?

00:38:25.783 --> 00:38:27.076
I mean, it's true.

00:38:27.159 --> 00:38:30.830
How could a measly kiss
warrant such retaliation?

00:38:30.913 --> 00:38:34.041
Just think of it as having played
a few games of ping-pong with a stranger.

00:38:35.126 --> 00:38:36.669
-Ping-pong?
-Yeah.

00:38:36.752 --> 00:38:39.004
Oh, I see.

00:38:39.839 --> 00:38:41.757
If it's no big deal at all,

00:38:41.841 --> 00:38:43.717
then how about
another game of ping-pong here?

00:38:44.427 --> 00:38:45.469
Well?

00:38:45.553 --> 00:38:46.554
Should I serve first?

00:38:46.637 --> 00:38:48.264
That's not what I meant.

00:38:48.347 --> 00:38:50.307
What's the matter? It's no big deal.

00:38:51.225 --> 00:38:52.435
Ping-pong.

00:38:52.518 --> 00:38:54.103
Ping-pong.

00:39:00.109 --> 00:39:02.736
Does it look like I'm doing all this
because of a kiss?

00:39:03.737 --> 00:39:05.239
You need to get a grip,

00:39:05.823 --> 00:39:06.907
Jun's mom.

00:39:15.833 --> 00:39:17.626
Please get back safely.

00:39:39.064 --> 00:39:40.149
What? Ping-pong?

00:39:41.317 --> 00:39:42.359
Ping-pong?

00:39:42.443 --> 00:39:44.195
Ping-pong, my ass.

00:39:47.448 --> 00:39:50.075
How could she compare that to ping-pong?

00:40:05.841 --> 00:40:06.759
Come on.

00:40:06.842 --> 00:40:08.135
You expected as much.

00:40:08.219 --> 00:40:10.137
I should be thankful
that he's letting me stay.

00:40:10.221 --> 00:40:12.806
Beggars can't be choosers.

00:41:05.234 --> 00:41:08.070
24 HOURS LATER

00:41:18.789 --> 00:41:21.417
It's been hours. How is she still awake?

00:41:25.921 --> 00:41:28.173
You think I'll quit over this?

00:41:28.257 --> 00:41:31.510
Let's see who wins.

00:41:43.772 --> 00:41:47.484
36 HOURS LATER

00:41:47.568 --> 00:41:49.570
This is just pure torture.

00:41:50.154 --> 00:41:52.239
Why the hell did I have to kiss him?

00:41:56.410 --> 00:41:58.203
Maybe just a short nap.

00:42:15.054 --> 00:42:16.138
TEAM MEMBER GO DA-RIM

00:42:16.221 --> 00:42:19.141
COMPLETED THE 22ND CYCLE AT 0100 HOURS,
MR. GONG!

00:42:23.729 --> 00:42:25.439
I bet she's dozing off right now.

00:42:26.023 --> 00:42:27.107
Go Da-rim.

00:42:28.233 --> 00:42:30.486
You're fired for neglect of duty.

00:42:57.304 --> 00:42:58.889
Go Da-rim!

00:42:59.515 --> 00:43:00.557
Come out!

00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:09.024
Come out now!

00:43:43.058 --> 00:43:44.643
Mr. Gong, are you okay?

00:43:48.188 --> 00:43:49.398
What happened--

00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:13.964
Thank goodness.

00:44:16.633 --> 00:44:19.762
Were you worried about me?

00:44:26.435 --> 00:44:27.853
I thought something terrible had happened!

00:44:29.438 --> 00:44:30.439
This…

00:44:32.065 --> 00:44:34.067
It's such a hassle to deal with
a workers' compensation claim.

00:44:35.986 --> 00:44:38.489
Right, workers' compensation claim.

00:44:38.572 --> 00:44:40.616
Where did you go after starting a fire?

00:44:40.699 --> 00:44:43.202
I stepped away for a moment
to go to the bathroom.

00:44:43.285 --> 00:44:46.121
I didn't know either.
When did all this happen?

00:44:48.916 --> 00:44:51.293
I can't have someone
who's so careless and reckless

00:44:52.836 --> 00:44:54.171
on my team.

00:44:57.049 --> 00:44:58.258
Take responsibility and leave.

00:45:04.181 --> 00:45:05.474
That's nonsense.

00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:08.977
Listen.

00:45:11.772 --> 00:45:14.024
I didn't sleep a wink
and checked for thermal shrinkage

00:45:14.107 --> 00:45:15.692
every hour on the dot.

00:45:16.276 --> 00:45:18.695
I only went to the bathroom
because I couldn't hold it in any longer.

00:45:25.786 --> 00:45:27.371
You agreed to take on this task.

00:45:28.789 --> 00:45:30.624
Are you trying to brag
about carrying it out?

00:45:30.707 --> 00:45:31.833
I am.

00:45:31.917 --> 00:45:33.043
I did say I'd do it.

00:45:33.835 --> 00:45:34.878
But you know,

00:45:35.671 --> 00:45:37.506
is it normal to assign
a task that requires

00:45:37.589 --> 00:45:39.174
five all-nighters to just one person?

00:45:39.258 --> 00:45:41.927
Not to mention,
what was I supposed to do to prevent

00:45:42.010 --> 00:45:43.595
the wind from blowing sparks?

00:45:44.221 --> 00:45:46.014
I refuse to leave.

00:45:46.098 --> 00:45:48.058
You can leave.

00:45:52.813 --> 00:45:53.855
Is that so?

00:45:55.148 --> 00:45:56.650
Then I'll leave.

00:46:01.113 --> 00:46:02.948
Wait, take your…

00:46:10.581 --> 00:46:12.457
I've already found my luck.

00:46:13.667 --> 00:46:14.835
You, Mr. Gong Ji-hyeok.

00:47:34.289 --> 00:47:36.333
She was one tenacious cookie.

00:47:36.416 --> 00:47:38.085
She just stayed
right in front of that fire

00:47:38.168 --> 00:47:39.378
and carried on.

00:47:39.461 --> 00:47:43.423
If I just had one person like that
on my marketing team, we would…

00:47:46.385 --> 00:47:49.179
Did I ask you to go and assess
his team member's performance?

00:47:49.846 --> 00:47:50.681
My apologies.

00:47:50.764 --> 00:47:51.848
What about what I asked?

00:47:51.932 --> 00:47:53.016
Oh, about that…

00:47:59.815 --> 00:48:01.775
I need to keep going.

00:48:08.907 --> 00:48:10.409
If I put out the fire, it's over.

00:48:16.123 --> 00:48:18.166
Who the hell is that at this hour?

00:48:25.966 --> 00:48:28.385
Mr. Gong just had to show up

00:48:28.468 --> 00:48:30.721
at that very moment.

00:48:32.055 --> 00:48:33.014
My apologies.

00:48:34.641 --> 00:48:36.059
We at least confirmed one thing.

00:48:36.143 --> 00:48:37.144
Pardon?

00:48:37.227 --> 00:48:39.104
He went to check on the progress
at that hour?

00:48:39.688 --> 00:48:40.897
Pretty ambitious, Gong Ji-hyeok.

00:48:43.608 --> 00:48:45.485
TEAM LEADER GONG JI-HYEOK

00:48:53.201 --> 00:48:55.120
Mr. Kang, can I see you for a moment?

00:48:57.748 --> 00:49:01.042
Is Mr. Gong not coming in today?

00:49:01.126 --> 00:49:02.753
No, he said he won't be in.

00:49:02.836 --> 00:49:04.045
Is he sick?

00:49:04.629 --> 00:49:05.589
I'm not sure.

00:49:06.214 --> 00:49:07.466
He didn't tell me why.

00:49:12.429 --> 00:49:14.347
How could he actually not show up?

00:49:14.431 --> 00:49:15.682
What if he gets fired?

00:49:19.519 --> 00:49:20.353
He won't get fired.

00:49:21.354 --> 00:49:23.106
-Sorry?
-He can't get fired.

00:49:23.190 --> 00:49:26.151
That's why he just skips work
whenever he feels like it.

00:49:26.234 --> 00:49:27.194
Do you know why?

00:49:28.487 --> 00:49:29.321
Why?

00:49:30.530 --> 00:49:32.866
Mr. Gong is the son

00:49:33.450 --> 00:49:35.577
-of the chairman of our company.
-Really?

00:49:35.660 --> 00:49:38.121
I became besties with the cleaning ladies,

00:49:38.205 --> 00:49:40.290
and they said
he really is the chairman's son.

00:49:58.183 --> 00:49:59.184
Ji-hyeok.

00:50:00.477 --> 00:50:01.478
You scared me.

00:50:02.395 --> 00:50:03.438
You were there?

00:50:03.522 --> 00:50:05.190
I thought the flowers were talking.

00:50:10.779 --> 00:50:12.322
What are you doing here?

00:50:12.864 --> 00:50:15.283
Shouldn't you be at the office right now?

00:50:16.117 --> 00:50:17.077
I played hooky.

00:50:20.872 --> 00:50:22.332
I wanted to hang out with you.

00:50:22.415 --> 00:50:24.084
It's way too soon for that.

00:50:25.752 --> 00:50:27.879
You should learn all you can now

00:50:27.963 --> 00:50:30.006
if you're going to take over
the business later.

00:50:31.174 --> 00:50:33.927
You're smart
because you take after your dad.

00:50:34.010 --> 00:50:35.178
I'm sure you'll do well.

00:50:37.389 --> 00:50:39.182
Why would I take after that man?

00:50:47.315 --> 00:50:49.109
I'm only going to take after you.

00:50:50.151 --> 00:50:51.278
Okay?

00:50:51.945 --> 00:50:52.946
I…

00:50:56.032 --> 00:50:59.119
I don't want you to take after me.

00:51:02.247 --> 00:51:04.541
You should live differently from me.

00:51:05.125 --> 00:51:06.209
Happily.

00:51:13.258 --> 00:51:16.678
So the team leader who's been
ragging on you is the chairman's son?

00:51:16.761 --> 00:51:19.264
Yeah. It's just one hurdle after another.

00:51:19.347 --> 00:51:21.224
I don't think so.

00:51:21.308 --> 00:51:22.559
What do you mean?

00:51:22.642 --> 00:51:23.685
Business owners

00:51:23.768 --> 00:51:27.480
can forgive even the most annoying,
pain-in-the-ass employee

00:51:27.564 --> 00:51:28.648
if they're good at their jobs.

00:51:29.316 --> 00:51:32.277
They can never fire an employee
who makes them a lot of money.

00:51:32.861 --> 00:51:35.864
Therefore, you just need to
be good at your job.

00:51:36.781 --> 00:51:38.658
-Problem solved.
-Really?

00:51:38.742 --> 00:51:40.911
All can be forgiven
if I'm just good at my job?

00:51:40.994 --> 00:51:43.371
Yeah. That's a principle of capitalism.

00:51:43.455 --> 00:51:47.292
But why is he already ragging on you
when you've only just started?

00:51:51.922 --> 00:51:53.340
I don't like that.

00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:59.387
-Stop. Hold on.
-What's wrong with you?

00:51:59.471 --> 00:52:00.805
-Hold on.
-Move!

00:52:00.889 --> 00:52:02.515
-No!
-Hey!

00:52:03.892 --> 00:52:05.560
What's wrong with you?

00:52:10.148 --> 00:52:11.024
Da-rim?

00:52:11.858 --> 00:52:13.360
-Oh my!
-Da-rim!

00:52:13.443 --> 00:52:15.487
Oh my gosh!
Do you live in this neighborhood?

00:52:15.570 --> 00:52:17.489
-My gosh, hi!
-No way!

00:52:17.572 --> 00:52:21.409
-Does that make us neighborhood buddies?
-Totally!

00:52:23.411 --> 00:52:26.247
And is this handsome gentleman
your dear husband?

00:52:26.331 --> 00:52:28.416
-Oh, I'm not--
-Yes!

00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:30.210
He's my husband.

00:52:31.544 --> 00:52:33.630
Babe, say hello.

00:52:33.713 --> 00:52:36.925
This is Jang Jin-hui,
my colleague from the same intake.

00:52:41.805 --> 00:52:43.264
Have you lost your mind?

00:52:44.265 --> 00:52:46.017
I'm sorry. I really am.

00:52:46.101 --> 00:52:48.603
Just help me out for six months
until I become a full-time employee.

00:52:49.187 --> 00:52:51.189
After six months,
I'll tell them I got a divorce.

00:52:51.272 --> 00:52:52.482
Isn't this fraud?

00:52:52.565 --> 00:52:53.942
I know, yeah.

00:52:54.693 --> 00:52:56.444
You've got to be kidding me.

00:52:56.528 --> 00:52:58.655
I promise I won't cause you any trouble.

00:52:59.155 --> 00:53:01.533
I mean, it's not like you'll ever
see someone from my office.

00:53:01.616 --> 00:53:02.951
I just…

00:53:03.493 --> 00:53:04.995
I just did.

00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:08.540
This is insane.

00:53:09.416 --> 00:53:10.250
My dear friend.

00:53:11.167 --> 00:53:14.379
Just pretend to be my husband
for six months.

00:53:23.638 --> 00:53:25.682
Good morning…

00:53:31.813 --> 00:53:34.566
Why do you all look so down?

00:53:34.649 --> 00:53:38.028
What's the point of working
if the team will disappear soon?

00:53:38.111 --> 00:53:39.487
Pardon? What do you mean?

00:53:40.155 --> 00:53:42.449
According to the rumors,
our team was created just for show

00:53:42.532 --> 00:53:46.619
so the chairman's son
would have a position in the company.

00:53:46.703 --> 00:53:48.997
That's why it doesn't matter
if Mr. Gong shows up or not.

00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:51.291
Our team could disappear
or mess up royally.

00:53:51.374 --> 00:53:53.084
None of it matters.

00:53:53.168 --> 00:53:55.754
I did think it was weird
that the one job requirement

00:53:55.837 --> 00:53:56.963
was having a kid.

00:53:57.589 --> 00:54:00.216
What good will sighing do?
We should start looking for another job.

00:54:04.262 --> 00:54:07.015
Guys, those are just still rumors
at the end of the day.

00:54:07.682 --> 00:54:10.060
I mean, even if they are true,

00:54:10.143 --> 00:54:12.979
we still have six whole months.

00:54:13.563 --> 00:54:14.773
What does that change?

00:54:15.982 --> 00:54:18.777
Are you just going to let people
look down on you?

00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:20.195
Without even putting up a fight?

00:54:20.862 --> 00:54:23.740
If we can show them how capable we are,

00:54:23.823 --> 00:54:25.492
would they still fire us?

00:54:26.951 --> 00:54:28.411
I don't think so.

00:54:28.995 --> 00:54:30.371
No business owner

00:54:30.455 --> 00:54:32.874
will fire a hard-working employee
who makes them money.

00:54:34.709 --> 00:54:37.295
We'll show them through results.

00:54:37.378 --> 00:54:40.006
We'll make them want to keep us.

00:54:40.090 --> 00:54:42.008
Got it?

00:54:48.681 --> 00:54:50.308
You know what? Screw it.

00:54:50.391 --> 00:54:53.228
Before I'm forced out,
I'll show them a piece of what I got.

00:54:54.604 --> 00:54:57.148
I, too, can't quit like this
because I'll die of embarrassment

00:54:57.232 --> 00:54:59.150
-from my husband and in-laws.
-Exactly.

00:55:00.401 --> 00:55:01.569
Let's see it through.

00:55:01.653 --> 00:55:03.029
-Yeah.
-Okay.

00:55:03.113 --> 00:55:05.615
In the spirit of that,
should we do a cheer?

00:55:05.698 --> 00:55:07.534
-Okay, bring it in.
-Bring it in.

00:55:07.617 --> 00:55:08.576
-Bring it in.
-Bring it in.

00:55:08.660 --> 00:55:10.620
I say, "Mother." You say, "TF." Okay?

00:55:10.703 --> 00:55:12.080
-Yes!
-Okay!

00:55:12.163 --> 00:55:13.289
Mother.

00:55:13.373 --> 00:55:14.582
-TF!
-TF!

00:55:27.887 --> 00:55:29.931
-Oh, 25.
-25.

00:55:30.014 --> 00:55:31.516
A, yes.

00:55:31.599 --> 00:55:33.017
-One…
-Great.

00:55:33.101 --> 00:55:34.060
Two…

00:55:34.853 --> 00:55:35.728
Three.

00:55:59.252 --> 00:56:00.086
I'm clocking out.

00:56:00.170 --> 00:56:01.963
I'm heading out first, okay?

00:56:03.173 --> 00:56:04.299
STABLE FLOW RATE AND VELOCITY…

00:56:15.643 --> 00:56:17.353
-Late-night snack delivery.
-Oh my.

00:57:06.152 --> 00:57:09.072
NATURAL BEBE
NEW BABY BOTTLE PRODUCT MONITORING REPORT

00:57:11.157 --> 00:57:12.617
We did it!

00:57:13.534 --> 00:57:15.245
-We're done!
-Well done, seriously.

00:57:15.328 --> 00:57:16.871
I was so moved.

00:57:16.955 --> 00:57:18.957
You all worked so hard.

00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:21.668
I almost really died.
No more all-nighters for me, ever.

00:57:21.751 --> 00:57:24.921
I filled out the empty spaces and all,

00:57:25.004 --> 00:57:26.631
but I don't know if any of it is right.

00:57:27.257 --> 00:57:29.717
We all did our very best.

00:57:29.801 --> 00:57:33.221
Mr. Gong has to approve it first anyway.
He'll tell us if something is wrong.

00:57:33.304 --> 00:57:34.138
Oh, right.

00:57:34.222 --> 00:57:37.267
But he never shows up for work.
What are we going to do?

00:57:37.350 --> 00:57:38.309
Don't worry.

00:57:38.393 --> 00:57:40.603
I'll run over
and get him to sign off on it.

00:57:40.687 --> 00:57:41.854
You have to hand-deliver it?

00:57:42.438 --> 00:57:45.525
That's how chairmen's sons are.
I just hope he does it on time.

00:57:46.067 --> 00:57:47.151
Excuse me for a second.

00:57:48.528 --> 00:57:49.487
Yes, ma'am?

00:57:50.071 --> 00:57:51.573
Right now?

00:57:51.656 --> 00:57:53.741
I'll be right up. Okay.

00:57:54.450 --> 00:57:55.743
What should we do?

00:57:55.827 --> 00:57:57.412
The director is asking to see me.

00:57:57.912 --> 00:57:58.997
What about our report?

00:58:01.541 --> 00:58:04.210
I'll go and get him to sign off on it.

00:58:04.294 --> 00:58:05.253
You should go.

00:58:05.336 --> 00:58:06.296
Would you do that for me?

00:58:06.379 --> 00:58:07.547
Sure.

00:58:07.630 --> 00:58:09.882
Where is he right now?

00:58:29.277 --> 00:58:31.195
I've already found my luck.

00:58:31.821 --> 00:58:33.281
You, Mr. Gong Ji-hyeok.

00:58:35.116 --> 00:58:36.326
Could you possibly keep

00:58:36.993 --> 00:58:39.704
what happened in Jeju a secret?

00:58:40.413 --> 00:58:42.290
We weren't anything serious anyway.

00:58:42.373 --> 00:58:45.752
Anyone could make such a mistake
as they make their way through life.

00:58:51.591 --> 00:58:55.011
Just consider it a sort of accident,
shake it off, and forget about it.

00:59:40.932 --> 00:59:42.684
So you're going to shamelessly
just stick it out, huh?

00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:44.894
Then again,

00:59:45.687 --> 00:59:47.605
that was always your forte.

00:59:49.148 --> 00:59:50.441
If you need something,

00:59:50.525 --> 00:59:53.069
you're willing to link arms
with a strange man,

00:59:53.152 --> 00:59:54.362
kiss him,

00:59:54.445 --> 00:59:55.363
go on a date with him,

00:59:55.446 --> 00:59:57.657
and even go to bed with him
without batting an eye

00:59:57.740 --> 00:59:58.866
or an inkling of shame.

01:00:01.661 --> 01:00:03.037
I see work is no different for you.

01:00:03.121 --> 01:00:05.790
You know how to make good use
of your talents in many ways.

01:00:11.462 --> 01:00:13.214
Yes, I did make good use of them.

01:00:14.549 --> 01:00:16.092
And I plan on making
even more use of them from now on.

01:00:16.759 --> 01:00:18.302
Unlike someone who's the chairman's son,

01:00:19.011 --> 01:00:22.014
I don't have the luxury
to skip work and slack off.

01:00:23.099 --> 01:00:24.976
I'm not some brat
born into cushy privilege

01:00:25.059 --> 01:00:26.853
who never worries about making ends meet.

01:00:30.148 --> 01:00:30.982
What?

01:00:35.236 --> 01:00:37.447
What do you know about me?
How dare you talk--

01:00:37.530 --> 01:00:38.531
I know a thing or two.

01:00:39.741 --> 01:00:41.617
At the very least,

01:00:41.701 --> 01:00:45.204
I know you'd abandon your team
and skip work if you just feel like it.

01:00:45.288 --> 01:00:47.540
I'm well aware
that you're an irresponsible team leader.

01:00:48.624 --> 01:00:50.793
Then you must also know why I skip work.

01:00:52.670 --> 01:00:54.589
If you're that worried
about your team members…

01:00:56.591 --> 01:00:58.217
you should resign and leave.

01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:02.221
That way, I can also return
to where I belong.

01:01:03.723 --> 01:01:05.016
It's quite simple.

01:01:11.105 --> 01:01:11.939
Will this…

01:01:13.191 --> 01:01:14.192
be enough?

01:01:25.161 --> 01:01:26.537
I'll gladly accept

01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:29.040
all the rage you feel toward me.

01:01:30.416 --> 01:01:32.585
But the others on the team
have done nothing wrong.

01:01:33.669 --> 01:01:34.796
This report

01:01:34.879 --> 01:01:38.007
is the result of us running around
and putting our heads together.

01:01:38.591 --> 01:01:41.969
For them, this job and this report

01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:44.680
are their livelihoods and lifelines.

01:01:46.349 --> 01:01:48.017
So please, just take a look.

01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:50.228
Please.

01:02:06.869 --> 01:02:07.787
Is that so?

01:02:11.999 --> 01:02:14.293
Then why don't you prove to me
that this is indeed…

01:02:17.338 --> 01:02:18.297
your lifeline?

01:02:48.703 --> 01:02:50.121
No, no.

01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:13.162
DYNAMITE KISS

01:04:43.275 --> 01:04:44.443
Who the hell are you?

01:04:44.527 --> 01:04:46.153
I'm her boss. And who the hell are you?

01:04:46.237 --> 01:04:48.155
-I'm her husband.
-Don't tell me you're jealous.

01:04:48.239 --> 01:04:50.366
Seeing your perfectly fine husband
just pissed me off even more.

01:04:50.449 --> 01:04:52.410
I didn't sleep a wink last night.

01:04:52.493 --> 01:04:53.786
I wanted it to look sexy.

01:04:56.247 --> 01:04:59.083
This won't do.
We'll have to put them in the spotlight.

01:04:59.166 --> 01:05:01.168
A live commerce? Today?

01:05:03.212 --> 01:05:04.463
What's wrong?

01:05:06.757 --> 01:05:08.884
Ms. Go! Are you really a mom?

01:05:08.968 --> 01:05:11.303
Look at the mess you made
because you couldn't change a mere diaper!

01:05:11.387 --> 01:05:12.680
Ms. Go is a member of my team.

01:05:12.763 --> 01:05:14.932
If anyone is going to scold her
and take responsibility for her,

01:05:15.016 --> 01:05:16.308
it'll be me.

01:05:16.392 --> 01:05:20.938
