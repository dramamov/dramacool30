00:01:10.602 --> 00:01:13.836
(Returning Pearl)

00:01:15.173 --> 00:01:17.349
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.416
I, Jing Yuan, Director of the Department of Punishments,

00:01:22.813 --> 00:01:24.308
pay my respects to Your Highness.

00:01:25.118 --> 00:01:26.198
You may rise.

00:01:26.278 --> 00:01:27.391
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:01:28.478 --> 00:01:30.038
How is the case progressing?

00:01:30.118 --> 00:01:31.598
The mastermind has been identified.

00:01:31.678 --> 00:01:33.734
It's Nanny Song, the Head of the Laundry Bureau.

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.122
Bring her forward.

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:39.289
She's the palace maid who entered the palace with a forged identity.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.015
(Who knows what this identity was used for before?)

00:01:50.077 --> 00:01:53.014
(I need to come up with a plausible story fast, or I'm dead.)

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.645
Your Highness, I'll confess.

00:01:56.726 --> 00:01:57.996
I'll confess everything.

00:01:58.077 --> 00:01:59.642
I entered the palace…

00:02:00.998 --> 00:02:02.494
Actually...

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.575
Actually, it was for...

00:02:10.278 --> 00:02:11.580
(You're my only hope now.)

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.953
Lord Jing.

00:02:16.437 --> 00:02:18.310
Lord Jing? How could it be Lord Jing?

00:02:19.678 --> 00:02:21.718
How dare you spout such nonsense before the Empress.

00:02:21.798 --> 00:02:24.654
(I'm sorry, but you're my lifeline.)

00:02:24.735 --> 00:02:25.848
Right now,

00:02:27.768 --> 00:02:29.322
my hands hurt so much,

00:02:31.477 --> 00:02:32.590
but my heart

00:02:34.152 --> 00:02:35.329
hurts even more.

00:02:40.157 --> 00:02:43.293
I remember when we first met,

00:02:44.157 --> 00:02:45.733
it was love at first sight.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.576
I thought you were just a young master from an ordinary family.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.855
I never imagined our social positions would be so far apart.

00:02:57.678 --> 00:03:01.413
But true love knows no rank, only sincerity matters.

00:03:05.197 --> 00:03:07.973
What is love in this world,

00:03:09.717 --> 00:03:10.894
that it drives people

00:03:11.998 --> 00:03:14.054
to risk life and death for it?

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:17.977
Lord Jing.

00:03:20.811 --> 00:03:22.826
I went through great lengths to enter the palace

00:03:23.998 --> 00:03:25.774
just to ask you one question.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.615
(Now, all I need is a love token.)

00:03:32.597 --> 00:03:33.710
(This is it!)

00:03:34.671 --> 00:03:36.406
You shall be like a rock,

00:03:37.317 --> 00:03:39.214
and I like the reed.

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:41.907
The reed may be bound with silk,

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:43.643
But will the rock...

00:03:44.398 --> 00:03:46.797
But will the rock ever waver?

00:03:46.877 --> 00:03:48.830
- Let go. - Jing Yuan!

00:03:49.437 --> 00:03:51.237
If you truly have a relationship with this woman...

00:03:52.917 --> 00:03:54.374
I have absolutely nothing to do with her.

00:03:55.317 --> 00:03:56.430
(Not quite convincing enough.)

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.120
Your Highness, please don't make things difficult for Lord Jing.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.015
It's all my fault.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.359
I am just afraid.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.697
Afraid that after I die, there will be gossip throughout the palace.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.273
I am afraid.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.401
Afraid that they'll accuse Lord Jing of being heartless and unfaithful,

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:16.933
or a murderer who is utterly unforgivable and condemned by everyone.

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.520
When I think of this,

00:04:20.656 --> 00:04:22.792
my heart is in agony.

00:04:26.158 --> 00:04:29.454
(I've acted this well. Surely this should be foolproof now, right?)

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.353
That's easy enough.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.095
You are just devoted to Lord Jing and can't bear to implicate him.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.633
Very well then. I'll grant your wish.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.033
(I made it through!)

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.513
Beat her to death.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:49.873
What?

00:04:51.158 --> 00:04:53.454
(Wait, this doesn't make sense.)

00:04:56.077 --> 00:04:58.293
(What do I do? Who can save me?)

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.112
- Princess Huan Zhu! - Hold.

00:05:02.478 --> 00:05:05.325
Your Highness, I am with Princess Huan Zhu.

00:05:07.837 --> 00:05:09.510
You wretched slave, what madness are you babbling?

00:05:09.918 --> 00:05:11.574
There is no Princess Huan Zhu in the palace.

00:05:12.158 --> 00:05:13.533
There is no Princess Huan Zhu?

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.376
This is the realm of "My Fair Princess".

00:05:16.998 --> 00:05:19.334
How come Princess Huan Zhu doesn't exist?

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.376
(Did I accidentally delete her?)

00:05:22.158 --> 00:05:24.293
(Xiao Yan Zi, where are you?)

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.120
- Your Highness. - Well done with the case.

00:05:33.197 --> 00:05:34.997
Wrap up matters here quickly.

00:05:35.077 --> 00:05:37.351
The Emperor's hunt is imminent. You must prepare accordingly.

00:05:37.798 --> 00:05:39.791
- Yes. - The hunt is imminent?

00:05:40.077 --> 00:05:41.190
No wonder.

00:05:41.297 --> 00:05:42.817
Xiao Yan Zi hasn't entered the palace yet.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.481
Your Highness, Princess Huan Zhu is the Emperor's illegitimate daughter.

00:05:48.718 --> 00:05:51.198
On the day of the hunt, she will publicly claim His Majesty as her father.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.577
After that, she'll enter the palace.

00:05:54.077 --> 00:05:56.694
She'll become Your Highness' greatest threat.

00:05:57.558 --> 00:05:58.694
You're spreading malicious lies.

00:05:58.957 --> 00:06:00.070
Take her away.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.336
I'm telling the truth!

00:06:03.757 --> 00:06:04.870
Wait.

00:06:08.437 --> 00:06:11.853
Whether what I say is true will be revealed on the day of the hunt.

00:06:13.358 --> 00:06:14.718
(The Empress is suspicious by nature.)

00:06:14.877 --> 00:06:17.293
(If I say she's her greatest threat, she will surely spare my life.)

00:06:17.998 --> 00:06:22.574
(But Xiao Yan Zi, I'm sorry for giving you such a disastrous start.)

00:06:24.077 --> 00:06:25.190
Where are we going?

00:06:25.478 --> 00:06:26.557
Department of Punishment.

00:06:26.637 --> 00:06:30.031
No, the Empress has pardoned me. What do you want to do?

00:06:35.118 --> 00:06:36.613
I warn you, in this palace...

00:06:36.837 --> 00:06:37.973
How dare you run away!

00:06:38.637 --> 00:06:39.750
My lord, please forgive me.

00:06:41.184 --> 00:06:42.424
Greetings, Lord Jing Yuan.

00:06:42.505 --> 00:06:45.006
This palace maid clumsily broke something.

00:06:45.478 --> 00:06:47.158
I was just teaching her a lesson.

00:06:47.238 --> 00:06:48.774
That's all the lines she has?

00:06:49.038 --> 00:06:50.151
Yes, my lord.

00:06:50.397 --> 00:06:51.757
- Come. - No!

00:06:51.837 --> 00:06:53.918
Come! Hurry up.

00:06:53.998 --> 00:06:56.894
She just broke something. Do you really have to hit her that hard?

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.119
Insolent maid, you'll learn your lesson today.

00:07:02.317 --> 00:07:04.814
If you offend the princes or the consorts,

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.600
you could be executed 10 times over and it still wouldn't be enough.

00:07:07.678 --> 00:07:08.853
A mistake deserves punishment.

00:07:09.397 --> 00:07:10.510
Follow the rules.

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:12.753
Yes, my lord.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.376
Breaking hunting equipment is to be punished with 10 strokes.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.713
Oh no.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.033
She'll die.

00:07:25.718 --> 00:07:27.654
You are lowly palace maids.

00:07:27.957 --> 00:07:31.533
Once you enter this palace, you must know your place.

00:07:34.877 --> 00:07:35.990
Stop.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.720
10 strokes have been administered.

00:07:38.886 --> 00:07:40.840
Lord Jing, that was only three...

00:07:42.877 --> 00:07:44.053
Yes, my lord.

00:07:50.757 --> 00:07:53.493
Since you wanted to save her, why make her suffer those three strokes?

00:07:54.637 --> 00:07:56.950
Within these palace walls, the rules are supreme.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.920
A mistake must be punished. It is only right and proper.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.200
Rules?

00:08:00.277 --> 00:08:01.774
Are rules more important than human life?

00:08:02.317 --> 00:08:03.814
How can you be so cold-blooded?

00:08:06.238 --> 00:08:07.574
Do you see that vat in the distance?

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.480
Last year, a noblewoman tried to defend a palace maid who made a mistake.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.240
In the end, both of them were drowned in the vat.

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.936
If you want to survive in the palace,

00:08:14.718 --> 00:08:15.831
you should watch your mouth.

00:08:19.598 --> 00:08:20.711
He's right.

00:08:21.478 --> 00:08:23.053
I have to keep my mouth shut.

00:08:25.558 --> 00:08:27.253
I have only 66 lines left.

00:08:28.757 --> 00:08:31.973
(Once the lines run out, the character will die.)

00:08:33.838 --> 00:08:35.294
How many lines does he have?

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.800
Why don't you have a number?

00:08:43.877 --> 00:08:44.990
What number?

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:48.722
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

00:08:50.472 --> 00:08:52.282
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.216
(The number hasn't changed.)

00:08:56.438 --> 00:08:58.278
Talking to him doesn't reduce the number.

00:08:58.358 --> 00:09:00.133
(He must be my destined match!)

00:09:01.078 --> 00:09:02.191
Walk.

00:09:03.583 --> 00:09:05.343
(Department of Punishment)

00:09:19.436 --> 00:09:20.549
My lord.

00:09:21.037 --> 00:09:22.973
You can have a private conversation here with Ms. Lin.

00:09:23.157 --> 00:09:24.653
I will stand guard for you.

00:09:27.877 --> 00:09:30.831
It's all your fault for talking nonsense outside and ruining my reputation.

00:09:32.318 --> 00:09:33.431
Reputation?

00:09:34.797 --> 00:09:35.934
Does that mean...

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:39.197
- You're still a virgin? - You...

00:09:39.277 --> 00:09:41.174
So this love line is chaste on both sides?

00:09:42.277 --> 00:09:43.437
I like it.

00:09:43.517 --> 00:09:44.630
How audacious!

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.577
Let's talk things out.

00:09:46.658 --> 00:09:48.073
Don't reach for that whip.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:49.856
I read the stars at night.

00:09:50.104 --> 00:09:53.311
You and I share a destined bond from past lives. There's no escaping it.

00:09:53.557 --> 00:09:56.013
If you don't believe me, I can prove it to you.

00:09:56.637 --> 00:09:57.773
How will you prove it?

00:09:58.011 --> 00:09:59.610
Do you remember my prediction today?

00:09:59.691 --> 00:10:00.691
On the day of the hunt,

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.796
Princess Huan Zhu will claim the Emperor as her father.

00:10:02.877 --> 00:10:06.174
If that truly happens, wouldn't that be the best proof?

00:10:07.917 --> 00:10:09.517
What are you really plotting?

00:10:14.877 --> 00:10:16.294
These props are really heavy.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:17.960
So scary.

00:10:18.037 --> 00:10:19.150
So eerie.

00:10:21.397 --> 00:10:24.253
Sure enough, the Department of Punishments is true to its name.

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:25.957
Look at all this stuff.

00:10:26.743 --> 00:10:29.177
The Department of Punishment is a serious place. No fooling around.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.393
Speak.

00:10:36.557 --> 00:10:37.694
Well...

00:10:39.105 --> 00:10:40.280
I just want to make a bet with you.

00:10:43.757 --> 00:10:44.893
What do you want to bet with me?

00:10:59.517 --> 00:11:01.238
- How dare you! - I'll bet on this.

00:11:01.318 --> 00:11:05.071
If Princess Huan Zhu really shows up, I win,

00:11:05.157 --> 00:11:06.334
and this jade pendant will be mine.

00:11:09.258 --> 00:11:10.434
If you lose,

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.256
I'll make sure you die without a grave.

00:11:17.517 --> 00:11:18.630
Deal.

00:11:47.078 --> 00:11:48.718
My male lead.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.073
Got you wrapped around my finger.

00:12:03.198 --> 00:12:04.493
(The hunting grounds are huge.)

00:12:05.037 --> 00:12:06.574
(Where will Xiao Yan Zi even be?)

00:12:23.998 --> 00:12:26.677
(Jing Yuan, keep a close eye on Lin.)

00:12:26.757 --> 00:12:30.294
(If she makes any suspicious moves, take care of her for me.)

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.040
You were told to burn incense to repel insects,

00:12:37.118 --> 00:12:40.518
but instead you've been standing there in a daze, looking around.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.733
Jing Yuan, thanks for handling security today.

00:12:44.444 --> 00:12:45.557
Fifth Prince.

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:47.753
Lord Fu.

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.096
Jing Yuan, we grew up together.

00:12:52.238 --> 00:12:54.437
You've ignored countless noble ladies,

00:12:54.517 --> 00:12:57.013
yet you brought a palace maid to the hunting grounds today.

00:12:57.157 --> 00:12:59.477
Er Kang and I are very curious.

00:12:59.557 --> 00:13:01.395
It's just official business. Nothing else.

00:13:01.677 --> 00:13:02.790
Still slacking off?

00:13:04.478 --> 00:13:05.591
Get to work!

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:07.977
How cruel.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.390
She's just a maid who doesn't know the rules.

00:13:12.718 --> 00:13:15.454
Slack off again and I'll throw you in the woods for the wolves!

00:13:16.838 --> 00:13:17.951
Get to work!

00:13:20.358 --> 00:13:24.260
(I need to find a way to escape or I'll miss the key plot.)

00:13:24.917 --> 00:13:26.030
Why are you still standing here?

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:27.263
Get to work!

00:13:29.517 --> 00:13:33.399
What Er Kang meant was that you're cruel and heartless toward us.

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.520
Because you took the best bow in the entire hunting ground.

00:13:35.598 --> 00:13:37.214
A slacking maid?

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:38.320
I don't see any of it.

00:13:38.401 --> 00:13:39.514
Hyah!

00:13:39.765 --> 00:13:40.878
Hyah!

00:13:42.478 --> 00:13:46.733
Looks like I can only use you to save myself.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:50.193
Still slacking! I'll beat you to death!

00:13:51.478 --> 00:13:52.591
It hurts.

00:13:56.344 --> 00:13:57.457
This is...

00:13:57.917 --> 00:13:59.493
This is Lord Jing's jade pendant.

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:01.126
He never parts with it.

00:14:01.277 --> 00:14:02.390
Could it be that

00:14:03.557 --> 00:14:05.454
the rumors about you and Lord Jing

00:14:05.998 --> 00:14:07.334
are actually true?

00:14:07.718 --> 00:14:09.094
What do you think, Eunuch?

00:14:11.718 --> 00:14:13.373
Ms. Lin Er, you must be tired.

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.553
Get up quickly.

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:18.297
Go and rest in the shade. I'll take care of the work.

00:14:21.238 --> 00:14:23.054
Ms. Lin Er, please walk slowly.

00:14:23.198 --> 00:14:24.721
Watch your step.

00:14:24.869 --> 00:14:27.874
Princess Huan Zhu, here I come.
