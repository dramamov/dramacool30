ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL
"MY QUEEN" BY XIE LOUNAN

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.400
General. The darn emperor's
reinforcements have arrived.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.560
JIANGZHOU

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.640
Retreat ten li!

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.920
Retreat ten li!

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.440
Jueding.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.600
Jueding. How is it?

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.440
-Leave.
-Yes.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:11.320
Is it serious?

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.000
You're being reckless.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.680
As the empress,
you should stay in the palace.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.960
How can you come to such a place?

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.400
How dare you mention that?

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.920
I heard the situation
in Jiangzhou is critical.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Do you know how worried I am about you?

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.320
Regarding your arrival in Jiangzhou today,

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.480
did Father and His Majesty know?
Could they rest assured?

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.560
I didn't tell Father.
As for the other one,

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.320
it's better not to tell him.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:37.960
Did he bully you?

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.520
His Majesty has always been calculating.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.760
I know

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.840
he wants to use
you to achieve direct rule.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.760
He doesn't care about your safety at all.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.760
None of that matters now.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.880
Sit.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.080
What matters
is I can now confirm you're safe.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.600
Otherwise, how could I rest easy
staying in the palace?

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.280
Cangcang.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.240
I know you want to
roam the martial world alone,

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.160
being free and carefree.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.400
If it weren't for the Ling family
or for Father,

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.280
how would you have
been coerced by Xiao Huan?

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.760
When I learned you were to marry him,

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.800
I thought about returning to the Capital,

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.880
but that Xiao Huan wouldn't let me.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.320
Orders are orders.
Without imperial decree, I cannot return.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.080
But if I had known
today would turn out like this,

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.480
I would have risked my life
to bring you out of that cage.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.640
Jueding has really grown up.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.920
You even worry about me now.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.680
But what you just said

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.840
is beyond our control.
No need to blame yourself.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.640
Very well.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.480
Since you've come to Jiangzhou,

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.160
stay safely in the camp.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.080
Don't run around.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.200
I'll send someone to escort you back soon.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.320
I won't go back.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.040
Do you even remember who you are?

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.920
-I…
-Jiangzhou's situation is grim.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.240
If anything happens to you,
how could I explain to Father?

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.840
You rushed to
the battlefield to save me earlier.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.640
Just as reckless as before.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.320
But if something happens,

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.120
-how am I supposed to handle it?
-Jueding.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.040
I'm
no longer a weak woman needing protection.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.399
Although I'm not
an expert in military strategy,

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.320
I know a bit.

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:18.760
Jiangzhou's situation is dire.

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:19.839
You urgently need manpower.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.079
-I must stay and help you.
-But…

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.440
No discussion.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.480
Jiangzhou is dangerous.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.440
But fortunately, reinforcements are here.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.720
They can temporarily
hold back Kumor's army.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.720
I've analyzed Kumor's army's
positions and terrain

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:36.960
and have some speculations.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.840
Your Majesty. Victory at Jiangzhou.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.600
Reinforcements have reached Jiangzhou.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.080
Kumor's forces have retreated ten li.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.640
Xiaoxing Guards
reported back with intelligence.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.520
Kumor is assembling his troops,
planning a counterattack.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.280
He's always ruthless and cold-blooded.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.480
But my collected intelligence

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.960
regarding his personal habits is limited.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.640
It seems

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.720
my plans must be advanced.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.840
JIANGZHOU

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.120
Sir.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.680
What is it? Speak.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.840
Sir. I've received news

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.240
Young Lady has arrived in
Jiangzhou with the westbound army.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.200
Currently, she is in General Ling's camp.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.480
Her Majesty has traveled west,

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.160
yet I had no knowledge of it.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.480
I deserve punishment.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.560
Sir. The palace publicly claims

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:01.680
that Her Majesty is
recuperating at the outer palace,

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.640
but Li Hongqing has
sealed it off completely.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.160
My men can't gather any information.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.200
Nor did we know Young Lady is
with the westbound reinforcements.

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.480
Please punish me.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.200
You may leave.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.320
Yes. Thank you.

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.640
Stay calm.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.160
General Ling has already
gathered supplies for everyone,

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.200
ensuring that every
citizen in Jiangzhou receives food.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.440
-Good!
-Good!

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.000
Line up. Everyone will get a share.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.120
-Thank you.
-Don't rush. Everyone will get a share.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.040
Thank you.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.880
It's the year of famine.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.080
Food is scarce everywhere.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.720
You distribute food to
the people of Jiangzhou.

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:58.720
You're indeed
an excellent general of Great Qi.

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.520
Cangcang. Stop praising me.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.520
-Let's hand out the food together.
-Line up.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.720
Alright.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.360
QI

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.800
The westbound reinforcements' supplies

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.080
can only temporarily
ease Jiangzhou's crisis.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.160
The imperial grain shipments

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.400
will take at least another half month.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.000
So, we need to consider other solutions.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.560
With the Xijiang snow disaster,
Kumor is also short of supplies.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.200
If Kumor runs out of supplies,

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.200
will he have to retreat?

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.000
What do you mean?

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:30.800
During war,

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.880
both armies will
always set up key supply points.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.080
We might as well make use of it
and kill two birds with one stone.

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.200
Look.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.920
This is Jiangzhou City.
This is Kumor's camp.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.560
Kumor's Black Tiger Army

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:44.320
charged toward
Jiangzhou City with unstoppable momentum.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.600
Smooth and unhindered.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.000
But to their east lies
dense forest and swamp.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.240
Behind them is Qianlai Valley.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.760
Qianlai Valley is
known for its bottleneck terrain.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.280
The mountains on both
sides aren't high, but they're steep.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.200
Kumor's tactics are cunning.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.240
They chose this terrain

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.400
to prevent ambushes.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.280
And they can fall back and defend.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.680
But Qianlai Valley's
mountain paths are extremely difficult.

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.920
It's not a suitable place for
storing or transporting military supplies.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.160
Moreover,

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.800
the valley sits against
the mountains and by the water.

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:14.040
Are you saying

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.520
they traveled by water to Sand City,

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.160
and Sand City is their key supply point?

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.560
It's possible.

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.640
If it's their vital point,
it'll be heavily guarded.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:26.200
Our army won't be
able to take it so easily.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.720
Our goal isn't to take over Sand City,

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.240
but to seize their grain supplies.

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.200
I can lead a night raid on Sand City.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.280
SAND CITY

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:34.360
We'll catch them off guard.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.880
If we manage to seize the grain,

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.679
not only will the people in the city
and the soldiers get a breather,

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.200
but it may also help end the war quickly.

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.160
You control the others.

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.320
You come with me to find the main house.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.520
-Yes.
-Let's go.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.760
Spare me, Sir. Spare me.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:45.800
Fix your clothes.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.880
-You're kind-hearted.
-Cut the nonsense.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.640
Where is your commanding general?
Tell me, and I'll spare your life.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.400
I don't know.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.520
Kumor suffered a defeat.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.640
As soon as the sun
set, he took people away,

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.000
saying they had important
military matters to discuss.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:13.840
And who are you?

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.240
My name is Minmin.

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.000
They abducted me.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.800
I… I don't know anything.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:30.840
How am I supposed to know

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.040
you're not lying to me?

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.400
They gave me these whip marks.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.680
I've been living in hell every day.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.200
Thank god you came.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.320
Take me with you.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.760
Commander. We're running out of time.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.240
If Black Tiger Army finds out
something is off with Sand City,

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.560
forget transporting supplies,
we won't even get out alive.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.400
I know where this city's grain is stored,
but I have one condition.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.120
If you find the grain,

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.800
you must take me with you.

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:08.280
How is the situation?

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.920
We've basically secured everyone here.

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:15.120
Good. Leave a few men to watch them.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.000
-The rest, come with me.
-Yes.

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:27.520
Sir.

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.880
Can I at least have a sip of water?

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:55.040
Your Highness. Are you alright?

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:59.080
Do I look alright to you?
A bunch of useless fools.

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:03.160
If I hadn't improvised on the spot
and fooled them,

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:05.800
I, the commander of Sand City,

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:07.840
would've become
the joke of Black Tiger Army.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:08.760
Yes.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.680
Your Highness. What should we do now?

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:15.080
Go.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:16.680
Release the refugees we locked up.

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.480
-Tell them they have food now.
-Yes.

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.280
This grain was way too easy to get.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.760
Kumor suffered a defeat.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.080
As soon as the sun
set, he took people away,

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.520
saying they had important
military matters to discuss.

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:47.960
My name is Minmin.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.720
They abducted me.

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.760
I… I don't know anything.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.640
I know where this city's grain is stored,

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.080
but I have one condition.

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:00.560
Something's off with that woman.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.440
All soldiers, listen up!

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:04.440
Take the grain and evacuate immediately!

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:05.840
Yes!

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:12.320
Quick, keep up!

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:29.640
Why can't we see
which direction the tracks go?

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.240
Could it be they sensed it beforehand?

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.440
Move.

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:44.880
-Where's the grain?
-It's all gone.

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.000
-What happened?
-How is everything gone?

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:46.960
Yes.

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.040
Looks like they already knew. Retreat.

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.760
Sir. You scared me.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:07.520
We meet again. Sand City Lord.

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:12.400
You're quite clever.

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:14.840
May I ask where I slipped up?

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:16.480
Your whip marks.

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.280
I heard noise last night.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.040
Knowing I couldn't escape,

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:23.720
I quickly whipped myself a few times.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:24.760
Just enough, not too heavy.

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:27.920
And I usually use a long whip.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.680
So having old marks is unavoidable.

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:30.960
Yes.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.720
At first, your mix of old and new marks
did fool me.

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:35.720
After all,

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.280
a woman as pretty as you

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.200
is hard not to sympathize with.

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.560
But you still held back too much.

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.440
Some marks were too fresh.

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:46.280
And your room
was decorated far too femininely.

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:49.080
So you hid the direction of the tracks,

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:50.480
keeping us from finding the grain.

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:53.200
You think you can stall us?

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:56.480
Ask my whip if it agrees.

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.080
Don't come closer.

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.240
One more step and I'll kill her.

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:40.880
Stop him.
I'll give you three days' worth of food.

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:42.760
Don't come closer. Back off!

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:44.960
To them,

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.720
you're just meat
that can fill a starving wolf.

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:48.920
They won't let go.

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.320
You're kind-hearted,

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:54.040
so will you kill these refugees to escape

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.600
or surrender?

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:05.040
Who are you? Ling Jueding's subordinate?

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.360
Do you know the punishment
for stealing military grain?

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:16.760
You seem bold and shrewd.
And you fight well.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.320
Why don't you work for me?

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:22.920
Maybe I can persuade
my brother to spare you.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.520
You have quite the temper.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:29.800
But I'd like to see
if you're still this tough

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:31.120
when you meet my brother.

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:38.480
Winning and losing are part of war.

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:42.760
I just want that darn emperor
to feel miserable.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.160
Here.

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:47.480
A toast to General.

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:54.840
Kumor.

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:56.320
Sand City's grain has been seized.

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:58.480
-What?
-Bring him over.

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:01.800
It's him.

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.000
He led the raid to steal the grain.

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:20.839
This guy looks familiar.

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:41.840
I remember now.

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:46.040
You shot an arrow at me
on the day of the siege.

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:53.760
You've got guts.

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.920
How dare you steal my rations?

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:59.280
You're about to die,
yet you can still smile?

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:01.880
If one life

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:05.280
can force a general
to run out of supplies,

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:07.680
-it's worth it.
-You…

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:10.200
If you can tell me where the grain is…

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:13.760
I suppose it's
already in Jiangzhou's camp.

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:15.720
Drag him away.

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:17.120
Kill him and use him as
a sacrifice to the war flag.

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:18.680
Yes.

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:54.920
Your Majesty. Are you alright?

00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:59.240
I'm fine.

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:02.280
I just had a nightmare.

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:05.440
PURE AND SPOTLESS

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:06.680
Speaking of,

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:08.800
Why is today's battle report
still not here?

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:11.880
I'll urge Commander Li again.

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.480
Bring all Great Qi prisoners.

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.320
Kill them as sacrifice to the war flag.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:49.480
Yes!

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:19.520
Wait!

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.520
I'm the one who stole your grain.

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:29.320
You should kill me first.

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:32.160
Winners rule, losers fall.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.600
You've fallen into my hands.

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:36.880
What right do you have to negotiate?

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.680
One takes responsibility
for what they've done.

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:42.360
This whole grain raid
had nothing to do with them.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:49.280
I've long heard General Kumor was brave.

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:50.600
Could it be

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:53.520
you're just a coward
who slaughters innocents?

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:03.120
Since you have a death wish,

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:05.360
I'll personally send you on your way.

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:43.200
Good. Again!

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:13.160
Phoenix Seal?

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.360
Why would Phoenix Seal be on me?

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:00.680
So you're a woman.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.160
EMPRESS'S SEAL

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.360
Keep a close eye on her.

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:22.880
Kumor. What about the sacrifice?

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:24.680
We're not doing it.

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:27.160
I'm keeping this woman.

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:31.280
Then… What about the grain?

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:35.480
With this generous gift
from Emperor of Great Qi,

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:36.880
why would we fear lacking grain?

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:39.560
I fear even this war

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:41.240
may soon come to an end.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.440
What you're holding isn't mine.
Don't overthink it.

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:49.160
-Take her away!
-Yes!

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:01.800
EMPRESS'S SEAL

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:03.320
Your Majesty.

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:08.280
The battle report has arrived.
There's also a letter from Kumor.

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.960
YOUR EMPRESS IS IN MY HANDS.

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:28.920
EMPRESS'S SEAL

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.880
Your Majesty. What happened?

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:36.280
The Empress's Phoenix Seal.

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:38.800
Your Majesty, rest assured.

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:40.280
If Kumor saw Phoenix Seal,

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:42.040
he would never dare harm Her Majesty.

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:44.280
Kumor thinks

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:47.040
capturing my empress gives him a chance.

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:49.320
I would like to see clearly

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:52.240
whether this is my downfall

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:53.880
or Xijiang's turning point.

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:37.760
Your Majesty.

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:39.040
When the palace gates opened this morning,

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:40.880
Grand Tutor Ling is
already waiting outside the hall.

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:43.200
He said he has urgent matters to discuss.

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:45.400
Should we summon him in?

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:47.440
Prepare to go to Nanrong Palace.

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.800
Your Majesty.
You didn't sleep at all last night.

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:51.640
Should you rest for a while first?

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:52.560
No need.

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:54.520
My time is running out.

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:26.840
Preceptor Du.

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:29.040
You're distracted.

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:39.120
Your board is a bit chaotic.

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:41.520
I'm most apprehensive.

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:46.920
It's your move.

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:01.360
I heard

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:02.880
Ling Xuefeng is already

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:04.560
waiting outside
Wuying Hall for Your Majesty this morning.

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:07.040
There must be emergency
military news from Jiangzhou.

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:09.720
Yet Your Majesty

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:12.040
came to play chess with me instead.

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:16.000
Kumor has captured my empress.

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:17.600
The empress?

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:22.760
Her Majesty is the empress.

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:24.440
She fell into enemy hands.

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:26.320
The war situation is unsettled.

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:27.560
One wrong move,

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:29.600
and everything is lost.

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:32.280
What do you think?

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:34.480
How should I play this move?

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:40.000
I'm dull-witted. I dare not speak rashly.

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:44.360
I intend to go to Xijiang myself

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:45.600
and negotiate with Kumor.

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:46.880
What do you think?

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:47.920
No.

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:56.440
This empire's fate
rests entirely on Your Majesty.

00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:59.200
You must not leave
the palace at such a time.

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:01.320
Going alone into danger

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:04.360
will cause unthinkable consequences.

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:09.120
In your opinion, who would be suitable?

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:11.840
If Your Majesty wishes for peace talks

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:13.000
to save Jiangzhou,

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:19.720
the envoy
must hold status and authority in court.

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:23.960
Grand Tutor Ling has
been waiting outside the hall,

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:26.280
and Xiao Qianqing is in the Capital.

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.640
If Grand Tutor Ling goes,

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:31.920
whether it's out of
concern for his daughter

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.920
or to protect
Ling Jueding's command in Jiangzhou,

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:38.200
it would harm the interests of Great Qi.

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.600
Xiao Qianqing is ambitious and ruthless.

00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:44.560
If he colludes with Kumor

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:48.920
and Jiangzhou falls,
Your Majesty's life would be in danger.

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:02.400
I, Du Tingxin, am willing to
serve as the imperial envoy to Xijiang

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:04.720
to go on Your Majesty's
behalf to the rebel's camp

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:06.320
and negotiate with Kumor.

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:12.600
You're righteous
to resolve the crisis for me.

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:16.160
Before you depart,

00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:18.640
I wish to request something.

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:29.040
Everything I have
was given by Your Majesty.

00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:31.520
Whatever you desire,

00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:34.800
I will give
whatever I have without hesitation.

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:40.120
Yushu Pill.

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.280
Yushu Pill?

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:46.440
Yushu Pill is potent.

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:47.680
While it can forcibly
suppress cold poison,

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:49.520
it's only temporary.

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:51.360
-It may even accelerate…
-I know

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:53.680
it could hasten my death.

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:57.800
But Great Qi is facing
internal and external crises.

00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:00.200
I must endure this period.

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:01.560
I cannot afford any mistakes.

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:05.000
If my body suffers any mishap,

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:07.240
do you think
Ling Xuefeng and Xiao Qianqing

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:08.520
will spare me?

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:12.920
Since you know,

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:15.200
why

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:18.880
give the life-saving
medicine to Her Majesty?

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:26.560
Preceptor Du.

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:28.680
You've overstepped.

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:38.800
Rise.

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:42.400
I know you've always been loyal to me.

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:45.240
In that case,

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:48.160
give me Yushu Pill.

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:51.360
During this period,
you must not use inner force.

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:53.800
I will do my utmost

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:55.520
to find a cure for you.

00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:58.920
If the poison reaches the heart,

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:02.960
I fear even I can't do anything.

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:04.080
Very well.

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:08.240
Your Majesty.

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:11.200
I'm fine.

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:13.600
You need not worry.

00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:15.360
This time,

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.560
your mission to Xijiang

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:19.600
must succeed.

00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:39.320
How long has Grand Tutor been waiting?

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:42.960
Your Majesty.
It has already been three hours.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:44.960
Very well.

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:46.840
Let him continue to wait.

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:16.520
Shi Yan.

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:18.160
Take Xiaoxing Guards to Xijiang

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:20.400
and find a way
to investigate Kumor's camp.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.520
Search for any trace of the Empress.

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:24.840
Leave no clue unexamined.

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:26.640
Yes.

00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:29.720
WUYING HALL

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:32.720
You're in such a hurry to see me.
What's the matter?

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:34.240
Your Majesty.

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:37.840
Her Majesty has been
recuperating at the outer palace for days.

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:40.760
I'm very concerned and wish to visit her.

00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:43.400
I hope you will grant permission.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.640
The Empress's
condition has worsened recently,

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:47.840
making it inconvenient for visitors.

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:50.240
Is it inconvenient or impossible?

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:56.640
Why do you say so?

00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:59.120
Have you heard some rumor?

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:02.480
Since Your Majesty

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:04.520
does not wish to discuss the Empress,

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:05.640
I won't press the matter.

00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:08.320
I suddenly remembered

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:10.320
when Your Majesty suddenly fell ill

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:12.719
before ascending the throne,

00:34:13.639 --> 00:34:16.000
and the Empress Dowager
urgently summoned me to the palace.

00:34:17.239 --> 00:34:18.560
I know this,

00:34:19.239 --> 00:34:21.199
but the Empress Dowager
had already concluded

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:22.120
that I was incapable

00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:24.560
and tried to recruit you

00:34:24.639 --> 00:34:25.719
to depose me

00:34:26.239 --> 00:34:27.639
and make Xiao Qianqing emperor.

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:32.000
These old events are not worth mentioning.

00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:33.920
What I wish to tell you

00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:35.960
is something

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:38.520
unknown to you.

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:42.719
Somehow,

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:45.679
Cangcang hid in my sedan chair

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:46.880
and entered the palace with me.

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:50.440
By some twist of fate,

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:52.719
she sneaked into
Your Majesty's bedchamber.

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:15.400
You're the emperor
ascending the throne tomorrow?

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:29.840
How hot.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.240
Cold. It's cold.

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:42.120
Is this better?

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:44.880
Do you feel better?

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:51.440
-Am I going to die?
-You won't die.

00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:54.200
Have you forgotten?
You're ascending the throne tomorrow.

00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:57.320
Really?

00:35:58.080 --> 00:35:59.840
Can I really ascend the throne?

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:00.760
Of course.

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:02.920
You're the chosen one,

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.280
destined to be the emperor of Great Qi.

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:07.760
With a sweeping gesture of your sleeves,

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:09.120
you rule the world

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:11.520
and command respect from all sides.

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:17.600
Rule the world

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:19.840
and command respect from all sides.

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:44.320
Later, I finally found Cangcang.

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:46.920
On the way home,

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:48.720
she told me

00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:53.440
you're the chosen one.

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:56.280
I had been hesitating.

00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:57.680
Upon hearing this,

00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:00.120
I suddenly

00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:03.400
became determined
and believed that the two of you

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:05.640
are a match made in heaven.

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:08.880
I never expected

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:10.880
you share such
a deep bond with your daughter.

00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:13.920
Even your decision to support me

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.720
was because of a playful
remark the Empress made in her youth.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.040
If the Empress hadn't been poisoned,

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:21.320
and the poison

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.440
wasn't coincidentally
in the pear blossom honey you sent,

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:27.280
I would have almost…

00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:32.160
almost been moved by your fatherly love.

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:34.520
Your Majesty.

00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:37.520
Why such suspicion?

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:39.840
Grand Tutor.

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:42.640
I'm your student.

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:44.680
You need not pretend

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:47.440
in front of me.

00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:50.760
I no longer want to guess

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:54.400
how much of your love for you daughter

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:55.640
is genuine

00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:57.560
and how much is mixed with ambition.

00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:01.280
But I know you value

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:04.360
command of the Jiangzhou army
more than the Empress's life.

00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:08.080
Ling Jueding is
straightforward and forthright.

00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:11.360
If he knew his sister
was trapped in enemy territory,

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:13.320
he might risk everything
and lead troops to save her.

00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:16.880
The ministers at court
are all keeping an eye on Jiangzhou's war.

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:19.160
If he makes even a single mistake,

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:22.240
he could lose his position as general.

00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:24.840
Do you

00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:29.160
have no genuine
feeling for Her Majesty at all?

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:32.920
I plan

00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:35.360
to send word to Kumor

00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:37.400
that Phoenix Seal has been stolen.

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:40.840
Do you think Kumor will believe it?

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:43.240
As long as everyone else does,

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:44.640
it doesn't matter if he believes it.

00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:46.080
I want him to know

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:48.560
he can't threaten me.

00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:57.200
Without her status as the Empress,

00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:00.680
Kumor would kill her without hesitation.

00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:02.240
If he kills Cangcang,

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.880
Jueding will surely slaughter Xijiang.

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:09.680
If he wins,
you can avert the crisis in Xijiang.

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:11.040
If he loses,

00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:16.120
you can reclaim
command of the Jiangzhou army.

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:22.680
If you dislike this,

00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:24.200
I have another plan.

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:29.600
I will personally go to Xijiang,

00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:32.400
negotiate with Kumor,
and bring the Empress back.

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:34.200
Your Majesty.

00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:36.080
What do you want?

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:38.360
During my absence from the Capital,

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:41.880
I want Prince of Yuzhang,
Xiao Qianqing, to act as regent.

00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:00.400
Your Majesty is wise.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:05.280
I will fully support
Prince of Yuzhang as regent.

00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:18.160
You just heard, right?

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:20.040
The Empress has been captured.

00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:21.760
I will personally rescue her.

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:24.480
During this period,
you will act as regent.

00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:27.280
You worry Grand Tutor Ling

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:30.240
will seize control of
the court after leaving the Capital?

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:32.640
Now that Her Majesty has been captured,

00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:34.320
you act accordingly,

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:36.760
forcing Grand Tutor Ling
to support my regency.

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:40.480
I'm determined to get
the command of the Jiangzhou army.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:46.840
What if I refuse?

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:50.240
Why refuse?

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:52.640
I'm afraid of being plotted against

00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:54.440
and not know how I end up dying.

00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:56.680
If I tell you

00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:00.000
everything I do is for Cangcang,

00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:01.560
would you believe me?

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:03.120
No.

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:06.160
The Jiangzhou war is unpredictable.

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:07.160
Your imperial power is unstable,

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:10.040
so you will personally go to Jiangzhou,

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:12.640
defeat Kumor,
and reclaim the army's command.

00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:15.040
Every step of your plan

00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:17.080
is for your imperial power.

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:21.160
Yes.

00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:25.120
My throne was hard-won,
so I must protect it.

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:27.320
But this time,

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.520
you're closer to my throne than ever.

00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:32.160
If I were you,

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:34.840
I would cherish this opportunity.

00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:44.120
Alright. I…

00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:51.560
I thank Your Majesty for your grace.

00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:55.320
-Prince of Yuzhang, receive the decree.
-I am ready.

00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:58.640
I am ill
and needs rest in the secondary palace.

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:00.560
During this time,

00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:03.440
Prince of Yuzhang,
Xiao Qianqing, will act as regent.

00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:07.040
I, Xiao Qianqing,
accept the decree with gratitude.

00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:12.560
Rise.

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:23.600
You may open this pouch

00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:24.600
when the time is right.

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:31.040
When is the time right?

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.320
You'll know when the moment comes.

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:39.080
I shall take my leave.

00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:49.600
Your Majesty.

00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:52.600
Are you really giving
the regency to Prince of Yuzhang?

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:54.520
What if he and Empress Dowager Liu…

00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:57.880
My brother is remarkably intelligent.

00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:02.600
He knows
the fiercer he clashes with Grand Tutor,

00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:03.920
the easier it is for me to benefit.

00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:06.200
But he also knows

00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:08.760
I placed him in this position

00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:10.080
so that he can't avoid conflict.

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:13.080
Any mistake

00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:16.680
could make him
completely devoured by the opponent,

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:19.840
but I chose him for another reason.

00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:21.520
What is that?

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:23.120
I trust

00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:26.160
this brother still has a conscience.

00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:29.320
He would never
ignore the people of Xuzhou.
