00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.700
Nothing. I was just carving.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:44.580
Oh, right...

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.130
I just went to see the Empress.

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:47.580
Do you know what she said to me?

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:48.420
What did she say?

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.490
You've got guts, Zhong Lin.

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:57.250
Now you even dare forge the Imperial Seal!

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:01.740
[Palace Defense Map]

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:04.100
A map of the palace defenses?

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:06.340
Zhong Lin, are you insane?

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.700
Do you know what you're doing?

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:09.460
Keep your voice down!

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:11.370
Are you trying to get me killed?

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:13.890
I'm getting you killed?

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:15.490
Right in my manor,

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:16.490
you're making something like this.

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:17.820
You're trying to get me killed!

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.770
This is a capital crime that wipes out your whole clan!

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:21.940
I don't even have a clan.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:23.700
Besides,

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:26.250
if you keep quiet, who'll ever know?

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.060
Move. You're blocking my light.

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:41.770
What exactly are you trying to do?

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:43.100
I'm going to save Cangcang.

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:45.770
Abducting the Empress is a capital crime too.

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.060
Trust you to come up with that!

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.370
Cangcang sent me a message.

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:51.060
She said she doesn't want to stay in the palace.

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:53.490
Anything Cangcang wants to do,

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:55.340
I have to help her do it.

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:57.820
Your plan definitely won't work.

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:00.490
Then do you have a better one?

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:04.850
I'm the Prince of Yuzhang.

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:07.130
What's wrong with me taking someone out?

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:14.010
So can you help me?

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:15.530
As long as you help me,

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:16.300
I can...

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:21.420
You can...

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:22.730
do what?

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:26.980
I can help you take Xiao Huan's throne.

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:29.890
I'll risk life and limb,

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:30.820
whatever it takes!

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:36.100
You hate Xiao Huan that much?

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:40.180
If he makes Cangcang sad,

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:41.580
then I'm not okay with it.

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:43.730
Anyone Cangcang doesn't like,

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:44.850
I don't like either.

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:54.980
So are you helping me or not?

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:04.370
Depends on my mood.

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:10.250
Depends on your mood?

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:12.850
So that's a no!

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:18.900
[Linghe Hall]

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:33.300
Your Majesty.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.180
This was sent over from Xuanguang Hall.

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:37.770
It looks like wine mash,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.610
but why is it shaped so oddly?

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:50.850
You may go.

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:52.180
Yes, Your Majesty.

Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:54.530
Three days from now,

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:56.530
the reinforcements will depart for Jiangzhou

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.010
to support General Ling.

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:02.890
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:10.730
As for Luo Xianxue's death,

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:12.570
I never expected

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:13.980
he would do that.

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:16.150
I understand.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.810
Your Majesty has your own burdens.

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:20.220
You need not blame yourself.

00:17:25.830 --> 00:17:26.620
Cangcang,

00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:27.900
you've gotten much thinner lately...

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:41.570
Your Majesty,

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:43.730
I heard

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:45.050
when the reinforcements march out,

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.730
Nanrong Palace will hold a grand river-offering ceremony

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:49.050
at the banks of the Qining River,

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:50.490
praying for the soldiers.

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:51.330
Is that so?

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:53.220
Yes.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.620
Would you care to attend with me?

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:01.050
I was actually going to say

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:03.180
I'm not fond of noisy occasions,

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:05.570
so I won't go.

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:36.770
His Majesty arrives!

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:41.530
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:47.570
Carry on with your drills.

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:53.010
How are preparations

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:54.180
for the ceremony coming along?

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.010
Please rest assured.

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:57.770
Everything is ready.

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:00.490
As for the finale of the fireworks,

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.220
would you prefer a golden dragon in the sky,

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:03.420
or...?

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:06.940
A golden phoenix.

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:08.460
Let the golden phoenix see them off

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:10.050
and bless their journey.

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:12.180
The Empress doesn't even want to come.

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:14.460
Does it really mean anything

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:16.420
to do all this?

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:20.290
What if

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:22.010
the Empress

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.050
changes her mind?

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:40.010
She doesn't have you in her heart.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.250
Why would she change her mind?

00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:54.180
Did you get the exit token I sent you?

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.180
In two days,

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.050
it's the river-offering ceremony.

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:05.420
With crowds going in and out of the palace,

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:06.810
that token

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:09.180
will let you leave.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.330
Why are you helping me?

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.180
I gave Zhong Lin my word.

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:17.700
More than helping Zhong Lin,

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:20.180
I'm afraid what you want most is to see

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.420
the Emperor and Empress fall out.

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:24.010
You saw through all that?

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.330
If you leave my brother,

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:29.010
the Ling clan won't be backing him as much.

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:30.810
Then,

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:32.770
I'll have my chance.

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.490
Thank you for your kindness,

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.290
but I have my own way.

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.700
You really don't need my help?

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:44.770
I'm usually cold and heartless.

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:46.570
It's rare I offer to help.

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.180
And you

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.730
still don't appreciate it?

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:56.530
I don't want Zhong Lin owing you a favor.

00:20:57.550 --> 00:20:58.460
There's one more thing

00:20:58.920 --> 00:20:59.900
I'd like to ask of you.

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:01.770
Go ahead.

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:04.420
Please take good care of Zhong Lin.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:05.980
Don't let her come looking for me.

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:07.490
Where are you going?

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.290
Better if you don't know.

00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:24.330
Ladies,

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.730
this year's river-offering ceremony is especially grand.

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:29.530
I hear His Majesty will personally see off the troops.

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:31.810
I heard that too.

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.140
To be chosen by Preceptor Du to dance

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:35.620
is such an honor.

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:36.380
Yeah.

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.570
After today's sword dance,

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:39.050
we get to escort the army out of the city.

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:40.180
How glorious is that!

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:40.860

the river-offering ceremony is about to begin.

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:48.810
Hurry and come with me.

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:50.050

Our best wishes to His Majesty and the Empress Dowager!

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:51.730
Rise!

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:03.050
The Empress still hasn't changed her mind.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.460
To skip such an important ceremony,

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:08.660
seems she has no respect

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:12.530
for our ancestral rites.

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:14.420
The Empress cares deeply for Great Qi.

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.530
Wherever she is,

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:18.290
she'll be praying for our land.

00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:22.140
Let's begin!

Yes, Your Majesty.

rise early and toil till night,

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:48.570
plowing fields and tending grain.

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:50.860
We pray the River Deity to bless Great Qi,

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.140
let our lands be rich,

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.490
our harvests be full,

winds and rains be gentle,

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:56.570
and our years full of plenty.

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:02.980
Offer incense!

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.380
Offer the wine!

00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:37.220
Send the offerings!

may our land stand strong!

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:01.940
Today's sword dance was well done.

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:03.620
All of you, step forward.

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:32.620
I like your dance very much.

you'll join me for the banner rite.

this goes against ritual.

how can a mere palace maid stand beside you?

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.420
I've already decided.

00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:44.900
No need to say more.

I

just want to stand with you.
