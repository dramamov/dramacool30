WEBVTT

00:00:07.461 --> 00:00:08.461
(Yong Qi, Er Kang,)

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:12.166
(show me today who is the greatest warrior of the Qing Dynasty!)

00:00:45.128 --> 00:00:46.562
What's happening?

00:00:51.213 --> 00:00:54.509
Emperor Father, I seem to have accidentally shot a civilian girl.

00:00:55.344 --> 00:00:56.608
Xiao Yan Zi, wake up!

00:00:56.696 --> 00:00:58.138
Xiao Yan Zi!

00:00:58.219 --> 00:00:59.762
Please don't die!

00:01:00.232 --> 00:01:02.449
If the plot doesn't move forward smoothly, we will get killed off.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.230
You insolent commoners! Who are you?

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.150
How dare you trespass on the imperial hunting grounds!

00:01:15.821 --> 00:01:17.422
Xiao Yan Zi, the Emperor is here.

00:01:17.503 --> 00:01:19.118
Didn't you have something to tell him?

00:01:19.708 --> 00:01:21.788
Your Majesty...

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.722
Your Majesty, do you remember Xia Yu He

00:01:27.105 --> 00:01:28.880
from Daming Lake?

00:01:37.323 --> 00:01:39.282
Quick! Save her!

00:02:36.122 --> 00:02:39.322
(Returning Pearl)

00:02:47.366 --> 00:02:48.660
Reality show of "My Fair Princess".

00:02:48.741 --> 00:02:50.796
Scene in Qing Palace, Laundry Bureau.

00:02:51.221 --> 00:02:52.221
Stay sharp, everyone.

00:02:52.371 --> 00:02:54.108
The one coming to rehearse later is a big star.

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.286
- Thank you, Ms. Sui Sui. - Thank you, Ms. Sui Sui.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:25.442
Ms. Sui Sui, thanks for coming.

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:30.122
Director, Sui Sui's role in this episode...

00:03:30.521 --> 00:03:32.042
Here's the thing, Ms. Sui Sui,

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:34.107
we drew lots for the roles in the last episode.

00:03:34.188 --> 00:03:37.124
Since it has already aired, there's no way to change the role now.

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:39.812
What did you say? Say that again?

00:03:44.036 --> 00:03:46.629
There are no small roles, only small actors.

00:03:46.935 --> 00:03:49.015
Does the role even matter, Director?

00:03:49.688 --> 00:03:51.050
Exactly!

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:53.042
The real issue is that

00:03:54.432 --> 00:03:56.100
how am I supposed to act without a romance storyline?

00:03:56.181 --> 00:03:57.242
Just serving tea and water?

00:03:58.558 --> 00:04:00.362
No, that's not right.

00:04:01.382 --> 00:04:04.762
But our theme for this episode is "My Fair Princess".

00:04:04.987 --> 00:04:07.402
You drew the lot for a palace maid.

00:04:07.566 --> 00:04:08.726
Well...

00:04:12.173 --> 00:04:15.762
Who says a palace maid can't have a romance storyline? Right?

00:04:15.887 --> 00:04:19.682
- Yeah. - Ms. Sui Sui, do you have any ideas for this romance storyline?

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.296
As for the romance storyline,

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.082
my male lead's presence

00:04:24.152 --> 00:04:27.562
absolutely cannot be inferior to the Fifth Prince and Er Kang.

00:04:27.918 --> 00:04:29.762
He's cold as ice on the outside.

00:04:37.568 --> 00:04:38.983
Matters of life

00:04:40.247 --> 00:04:41.522
hanging by a thread.

00:04:45.581 --> 00:04:46.694
Got it?

00:04:46.923 --> 00:04:48.563
Totally got it.

00:04:49.162 --> 00:04:51.424
Call me when the script is revised. I'm ready anytime.

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:53.282
Alright.

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:56.343
What do we do?

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:58.162
Let her direct it herself.

00:04:58.305 --> 00:05:01.140
(Even if I play a palace maid, I must be the main character.)

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:26.486
(Where am I?)

00:05:35.385 --> 00:05:37.425
(Is this the male lead they added for me?)

00:05:40.859 --> 00:05:42.842
(The production team is really thoughtful this time.)

00:05:43.001 --> 00:05:44.362
(He's a good match with me.)

00:05:47.327 --> 00:05:49.482
(What kind of plot is this?)

00:05:49.577 --> 00:05:52.042
(Isn't he supposed to fall in love with me?)

00:05:57.609 --> 00:05:58.963
Let go...

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:04.482
Why are you grabbing so hard?

00:06:04.608 --> 00:06:05.721
You're hurting me!

00:06:10.901 --> 00:06:12.077
What are you doing?

00:06:12.941 --> 00:06:14.802
Can't you even act, you extra?

00:06:17.736 --> 00:06:20.162
Director!

00:06:22.208 --> 00:06:23.746
I said I'm not doing this.

00:06:25.941 --> 00:06:27.501
My lord, he's not breathing.

00:06:28.194 --> 00:06:29.733
Brother, wake up.

00:06:29.855 --> 00:06:30.856
Cut.

00:06:30.944 --> 00:06:32.057
Wake up.

00:06:32.728 --> 00:06:34.282
Wake up. We're not filming.

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:38.984
If you continue to be so stubborn, this is the fate that awaits you.

00:06:46.927 --> 00:06:48.562
(He actually died?)

00:06:49.001 --> 00:06:50.466
(Where on earth...)

00:06:51.295 --> 00:06:52.842
(Where on earth am I?)

00:06:52.923 --> 00:06:54.882
(This realm originates from "My Fair Princess".)

00:06:55.047 --> 00:06:58.166
(Everyone's fate was meant to follow the original script.)

00:06:58.247 --> 00:07:02.482
(Ms. Lin altered the storyline at will, throwing everything into chaos.)

00:07:02.563 --> 00:07:05.283
- (The true and false princesses are displaced.) - What was that voice?

00:07:05.364 --> 00:07:07.203
(Destined relationships have become disordered.)

00:07:07.284 --> 00:07:08.522
Who is talking?

00:07:08.603 --> 00:07:10.019
(The world is on the verge of collapse.)

00:07:10.388 --> 00:07:11.842
(Only by restoring the original order)

00:07:11.923 --> 00:07:15.205
(can this realm and Ms. Lin return to where they belong.)

00:07:15.286 --> 00:07:16.463
Ms. Lin?

00:07:16.968 --> 00:07:18.081
Me?

00:07:19.723 --> 00:07:23.259
So, I've time-traveled to the script's world.

00:07:23.766 --> 00:07:24.846
(My male lead's presence)

00:07:24.928 --> 00:07:28.402
(absolutely cannot be inferior to the Fifth Prince and Er Kang.)

00:07:28.624 --> 00:07:29.664
(As they say,)

00:07:29.768 --> 00:07:31.442
he's a ruthless official,

00:07:31.567 --> 00:07:33.264
(where love and hate run deep,)

00:07:34.239 --> 00:07:37.193
(and life is always hanging by a thread.)

00:07:41.744 --> 00:07:43.801
Speak. Who are you?

00:07:45.056 --> 00:07:47.073
My current character is

00:07:48.744 --> 00:07:49.857
a maid.

00:07:49.938 --> 00:07:51.042
(Laundry Bureau)

00:07:51.713 --> 00:07:54.242
I'm a lowly palace maid from the Laundry Bureau,

00:07:54.383 --> 00:07:56.362
washing clothes and toiling away every day.

00:07:56.501 --> 00:07:58.042
Stop with the nonsense.

00:07:58.483 --> 00:08:00.442
Tell me what I want to know.

00:08:01.238 --> 00:08:03.842
(That was close. Good thing I've acted before.)

00:08:04.298 --> 00:08:06.242
(How do I make up the rest of the story?)

00:08:06.408 --> 00:08:07.583
I...

00:08:08.701 --> 00:08:11.076
I'm just a sixth-rank palace maid.

00:08:13.208 --> 00:08:14.663
In this palace,

00:08:15.777 --> 00:08:17.522
I have no one to rely on,

00:08:18.209 --> 00:08:19.762
lonely and pitiful.

00:08:21.449 --> 00:08:22.562
Shut up!

00:08:24.288 --> 00:08:26.064
Who brought you in?

00:08:27.207 --> 00:08:28.823
(How am I supposed to answer this?)

00:08:30.847 --> 00:08:32.282
What is this?

00:08:32.415 --> 00:08:33.762
Time-travel code?

00:08:35.087 --> 00:08:36.562
You're asking for death.

00:08:36.927 --> 00:08:38.040
I...

00:08:39.201 --> 00:08:40.621
(According to typical historical drama tropes,)

00:08:40.702 --> 00:08:42.879
(if I want to survive, I need to find a backer.)

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.073
I'll tell you.

00:08:45.522 --> 00:08:46.686
That person...

00:08:46.834 --> 00:08:49.865
(Cold as ice on the outside, but burning with passion inside,)

00:08:49.967 --> 00:08:53.122
showing warmth only toward me.

00:08:53.447 --> 00:08:54.703
That person is...

00:08:54.784 --> 00:08:55.962
Who?

00:08:56.562 --> 00:08:59.202
(I don't know if you're my male lead, but I'll take a gamble.)

00:08:59.291 --> 00:09:00.590
You!

00:09:04.617 --> 00:09:06.602
Your Majesty, it is time to rest.

00:09:06.936 --> 00:09:08.240
His Majesty ordered the Department of Punishments

00:09:08.352 --> 00:09:10.082
to probe the palace-maid smuggling case,

00:09:10.208 --> 00:09:12.042
but there has been no result so far.

00:09:12.217 --> 00:09:15.762
As the one overseeing the harem, how can I explain this to His Majesty?

00:09:15.987 --> 00:09:18.362
Lord Jing is handling the investigation.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.730
You know his capabilities, Your Majesty.

00:09:22.791 --> 00:09:26.167
My adopted son has always been reliable in his duties.

00:09:36.414 --> 00:09:37.922
You wretched slave.

00:09:38.046 --> 00:09:40.029
Forging identities of the palace maids is a capital offense.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:43.242
How dare you make wild accusations and frame Lord Jing!

00:09:43.323 --> 00:09:45.843
(So this is about forged identities and smuggling maids into the palace.)

00:09:45.924 --> 00:09:48.373
(Am I the palace maid who bought a fake identity to enter the palace?)

00:09:48.454 --> 00:09:50.673
Even now, you still won't confess!

00:09:52.841 --> 00:09:55.016
(This old woman is trying to frame me!)

00:09:55.098 --> 00:09:56.211
You...

00:09:56.778 --> 00:09:59.402
How dare you slap my face! I'll hit you!

00:09:59.488 --> 00:10:01.875
You insolent girl! How dare you fight back!

00:10:03.536 --> 00:10:05.442
- I'll hit you! - Stop.

00:10:10.128 --> 00:10:12.762
Nanny Wu, your bracelet seems rather extraordinary.

00:10:13.925 --> 00:10:16.242
(Some brains on this character after all.)

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:19.610
This bracelet belongs to Nanny Song...

00:10:19.697 --> 00:10:21.033
Lord Jing.

00:10:22.878 --> 00:10:24.758
The Department of Punishment seized the Laundry Bureau

00:10:24.872 --> 00:10:26.886
and summoned me and Nanny Wu here for interrogation.

00:10:26.967 --> 00:10:29.423
This has already delayed our work for several days.

00:10:30.303 --> 00:10:31.962
(Familiar plot.)

00:10:32.048 --> 00:10:33.887
(These two must be accomplices.)

00:10:34.013 --> 00:10:35.126
So...

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.600
You're blaming me then?

00:10:38.168 --> 00:10:39.522
I wouldn't dare.

00:10:45.128 --> 00:10:47.543
Nanny Song, your clothes are so plain.

00:10:48.248 --> 00:10:50.642
Why did you forget to change your shoes?

00:10:50.807 --> 00:10:52.882
As a nanny receiving a monthly salary,

00:10:52.969 --> 00:10:55.744
how can you afford brocade-trimmed footwear?

00:10:56.288 --> 00:10:57.882
Seeing the Department Punishments arrive,

00:10:57.989 --> 00:10:59.447
you changed your own clothes

00:10:59.543 --> 00:11:01.504
but had Nanny Wu wear the expensive bracelet

00:11:01.609 --> 00:11:03.522
to draw my suspicion to her.

00:11:03.701 --> 00:11:05.655
My lord!

00:11:05.841 --> 00:11:07.666
These were found in Nanny Song's room.

00:11:11.779 --> 00:11:13.299
The seal of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.320
The seals of the Yamen of various Banners.

00:11:15.458 --> 00:11:17.098
You forged the household registration documents

00:11:17.249 --> 00:11:18.985
and sold fake identities to the palace maids.

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:21.047
What audacity!

00:11:22.847 --> 00:11:24.482
(I'm out of danger for now.)

00:11:24.588 --> 00:11:26.482
(Let me just survive episode one first.)

00:11:29.243 --> 00:11:31.203
- Stand up! - Nanny, calm down.

00:11:31.288 --> 00:11:32.423
Nanny, please calm down.

00:11:32.528 --> 00:11:34.082
(What now? Another plot twist?)

00:11:34.163 --> 00:11:35.460
(Am I about to die already?)

00:11:35.552 --> 00:11:36.642
Nanny, calm down.

00:11:36.723 --> 00:11:38.482
How dare you betray me.

00:11:38.808 --> 00:11:40.682
Then I'll make you die with me!

00:11:47.727 --> 00:11:49.042
(This is...)

00:11:49.225 --> 00:11:50.602
(She has one too?)

00:11:53.847 --> 00:11:56.522
Have you forgotten that

00:11:56.883 --> 00:12:00.436
you entered the palace because...

00:12:09.512 --> 00:12:10.787
What...

00:12:11.055 --> 00:12:12.922
What is going on?

00:12:13.128 --> 00:12:15.122
(This is the script's line-count indicator.)

00:12:15.295 --> 00:12:18.282
(Once your lines run out, your character will die)

00:12:18.535 --> 00:12:21.296
(and disappear from the world of My Fair Princess forever.)

00:12:21.448 --> 00:12:23.152
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

00:12:24.408 --> 00:12:26.423
What did she mean by those words?

00:12:26.666 --> 00:12:29.201
What do you mean? How should I know?

00:12:31.221 --> 00:12:32.498
Confess now.

00:12:32.857 --> 00:12:35.464
What is your purpose for risking your life to enter the palace?

00:12:37.346 --> 00:12:39.287
- Guards! - Yes, my lord!

00:12:39.368 --> 00:12:41.682
- Interrogate her. - Yes, my lord!

00:12:42.391 --> 00:12:44.752
(What kind of deadly mess have I gotten myself into?)

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.922
The Empress has arrived!

00:12:47.048 --> 00:12:52.240
The greatest villain in the "My Fair Princess" universe, the Empress.
