=Those Days=

00:01:12.431 --> 00:01:14.800
(Adapted from iceread.com novel
"You Xi" by Qingyang Wanxi)

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.980
=Episode 24=

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:18.940
Shen Minghui,

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.340
are you pretending you don't see me?

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.660
Hello, Ni.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.460
Shen Minghui, I'm warning you.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.060
If you give Mr. Hu any more trouble,

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.140
I'll tell your sister.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.280
And she's pregnant, remember?

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:31.180
Ni,

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:32.900
whose side are you on?

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.420
Who is Mr. Hu to you?

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.340
He's my life coach.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.460
My entire life plan is his to design.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.140
Mr. Hu, is that okay?

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.100
I'm just worried
that I might not do a good job.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.940
There's no rush.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.540
You can draw once you're ready.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.440
Make every one of your strokes radiate.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.360
You guys can have
a baby together all you like.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:59.850
Just don't give him
the same name as mine.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.260
Here, Mr. Hu.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.100
Eat up.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.060
You too.

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:10.860
The pork ribs are delicious.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.860
Mr. Pan?

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.380
Mr. Pan!

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:18.380
Mr. Hu?

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:19.620
What is it?

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.950
I have something to discuss with you.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.660
Go ahead.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.300
Shen Minghui, a student in my class,
only distributed the answers

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.380
because he thought it was fun.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.460
And, he was sincere in
acknowledging his mistake.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:30.420
You see...

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.620
Can we rescind the disciplinary action

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.420
and give him a chance?

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:38.740
You think he's a kid?

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:41.740
Mr. Hu,

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.860
do you know how long Shen Minghui

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.260
has been studying in our school?

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.100
He's in his fifth year here.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.100
Listen, when it comes
to selling pork chops,

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.900
he's better at doing accounts than you.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.860
Tell him to study hard.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.900
Otherwise, it won't be as simple
as a disciplinary action.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:07.700
Shen Minghui.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:09.700
Mr. Hu,

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.460
please relay a message to Mr. Pan.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.100
Tell him to focus on his work.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.540
Tell him not to flaunt his superiority
or take bribes.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:17.660
Otherwise,

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.820
it won't be as simple
as quitting his job.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.140
He'll be sent to prison.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:23.900
You brat!

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.900
(Regarding the disciplinary action
that will be taken on Shen Minghui,)

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.660
(of Class 2 Senior 3, he shall be
given a major demerit.)

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.820
Lu Bing.

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:54.260
Come on.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:55.740
I'll send you home.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.300
(Xin City Grand Court)

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.900
Mingzhu.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.620
Recently,

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.860
I think I've been getting
more and more thick-skinned.

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.620
You see, there's one thing.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.650
I've inquired about it
from everyone around us.

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.180
I truly have no choice.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:12.780
What is it?

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.320
It's about your brother-in-law.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:16.460
Zhang Hao, my husband,

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.850
participated in a competitive selection
in his workplace lately.

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.380
He almost reached the finals.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.020
I was thinking

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.820
that since your father-in-law
is very resourceful,

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.420
I was wondering if you can ask him
to help my husband out.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.980
Sure. I'll head back and ask him later.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.060
But I cannot guarantee
that he'll help you out.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.660
That's fine.
Just asking him is good enough.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:38.500
Just asking him is enough.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.980
Please don't put yourself on the spot!

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.380
This is for your father-in-law.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.140
It's no need.

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.140
I couldn't ask you for a favor
here empty-handed.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.060
Take it.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.900
Thank you.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:54.380
Thank you so much.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.840
You're getting another
disciplinary action, huh?

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.340
You'll infuriate me to death.

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:25.380
I'll die from anger

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.020
before I die from overexertion.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.340
Eat up. It's piping hot.

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.220
Is Dad working overtime today as well?

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.620
It's been a few days since he came back.

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.060
I'm sure he's exhausted.

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:46.420
He's super busy, huh?

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.740
It's difficult to make a living,
you know?

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.220
He has to keep his eyes
on the goods he distributed.

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.140
If not, it'll cause
a lot of issues later on.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.020
I'm done eating.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.260
You guys can enjoy yourselves.

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.020
Who are you looking for?

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.340
Hello. I'm looking for Mr. Feng.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:06.820
I'm his daughter-in-law.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.620
Mr. Feng's office is on the third floor.

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:11.980
Come, I'll bring you there.

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:13.540
It's fine. I've been there before.

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:15.980
Aren't you guys rushing out goods today?

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:17.420
Nope.

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:19.060
Alright. Thank you.

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:19.580
Okay.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:20.620
Take care.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:24.740
Feng.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.500
You've got quite a bit of money
in your account.

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:31.980
You see, we're in a tough spot now.

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:35.320
You have to come up with a way

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:38.460
to patch this hole up
as soon as possible.

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:43.140
Mingzhu?

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:44.700
Dad.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.180
Sorry about that. I didn't know
that you guys were in a discussion.

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:47.740
Do you need anything?

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:48.860
You guys can go ahead.

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:49.540
I can come back next time.

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:50.620
It's fine.

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:51.480
Let me introduce her.

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:52.140
Come.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:54.220
This is my daughter-in-law.

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:55.580
This is Mr. Wang.

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:56.820
Hello, Mr. Wang.

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:58.140
So, you're Mingzhu.

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:02.460
Your father-in-law praised you a lot.

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.620
He said you were capable and sensible.

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:07.420
He has nothing but praise for you.

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.240
I'm not as good
as my father-in-law had described me.

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:11.100
What's good is good.

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.460
Nothing can stop you from shining.

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:16.140
Feng, it seems you guys
have a family matter to discuss.

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:18.060
That's very important.

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.060
We can discuss our matters next time.

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:20.740
Okay. Sorry about that.

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:21.920
- We'll talk about it next time.
- I'll head there first.

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:23.380
Okay. Please go ahead.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.360
- You guys can go ahead.
- Sorry about that.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:28.020
Come.

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:29.460
Have a seat.

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:30.620
Okay.

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:39.060
This is quite the sudden affair.

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:42.980
I came to look for you at the company
because I didn't want Mom to find out.

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:44.180
Yeah, don't let her know.

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:45.660
If not,

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:47.220
she'll nag us to no end.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.780
Regarding the company you mentioned,

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:53.240
actually, it's still within my reach.

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:54.900
If I can do it,

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:55.980
I'll surely do it for you.

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:57.820
We're a family, you know?

00:08:57.980 --> 00:08:58.860
You didn't have to.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:02.140
What about this?

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:04.260
You should send these to your father.

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:06.460
Your father delivers food
to you all day long.

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:07.530
It must've been tough on him too.

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:08.820
Dad, that's a different thing.

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:11.460
I have to do something in return
when I'm asking you for a favor.

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:14.100
But Dad, please don't be stressed out.

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:16.380
It's fine even if it doesn't work out.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.300
I'll explain it to my sister later.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:19.500
They will understand.

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:22.300
I can do it.

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:25.660
Mingzhu,

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:27.500
you're truly a sensible child.

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:33.300
(Golden Abundance)
This is truly extravagant.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:35.460
The price is indeed steep.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.060
Let's look at the list.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.260
A bride attendant and a groom attendant?

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:41.700
Why do we even need attendants?

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:43.420
They're personal attendants.

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:46.120
They handle the groom's
and bride's attire,

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.680
hair accessories, and so on personally.

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:48.700
They're also in charge

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:50.620
of emotional management
for the couple and their parents.

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:52.540
Emotional values are important,
you know?

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:53.660
Here, have some water.

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:54.720
- Thank you, Mingzhu.
- Thank you, Mingzhu.

00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:58.580
You guys can take a look at this.

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:00.500
This Through Thick and Thin Set

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:01.820
has everything you need.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:03.700
It doesn't have anything unnecessary.

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:04.700
You can treat your friends and family

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:06.660
to something better
with the money you've saved.

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:07.540
It's more practical.

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:08.620
Mingzhu is right.

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:10.770
The food that goes into our bellies
is what truly counts.

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:11.660
You're such a glutton.

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:16.340
(Love Stronger Than Gold)
Mingzhu, isn't this set cheaper?

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:17.980
As for this set,

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:19.460
I don't really recommend it.

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:21.540
Actually, it doesn't offer
any wedding packages.

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:22.700
They just hang a big red curtain

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:23.700
with the character "bliss" on it

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:24.900
to curate a festive mood.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:26.380
If so, it should be called

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:27.740
Love Weaker Than Gold.

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:30.380
Understood. It's just a meal, right?

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:31.460
It's just a banquet.

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:33.750
It's just a comparison tool
for the bottom-tier sets, huh?

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:35.080
We usually recommend

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.260
the Through Thick and Thin Set
to our own family members.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.100
It represents
a steady marriage and life.

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:42.540
Thank you, Mingzhu.

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:43.140
Mingzhu!

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:44.460
Sorry that I'm late.

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:45.300
Let me introduce her.

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:46.140
This is Ni.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.260
That's Zhidong and Bichen.

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:48.300
We met before.

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:50.940
Hello.

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:52.340
Nice to meet you.

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:53.100
Likewise.

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:54.850
It's only nice
when everyone is doing well.

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:55.700
Where are we?

00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:57.380
This one.

00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.960
What do you guys think about
the Through Thick and Thin Set?

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:01.380
It's great.

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:03.140
I just confessed to Hu Gang.

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:04.780
What did he say?

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:05.980
He was elated.

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:07.620
He was deeply engrossed.

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:10.580
Let me introduce the set to you.

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:12.420
The Through Thick and Thin Set

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:14.340
is our company's signature package.

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:16.380
It's affordable,
and comes in generous portions.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.300
It does have a lot of varieties.

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:20.220
Miss Ni,

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:23.100
I suppose your company is quite large.

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:25.380
Indeed.

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:26.900
We provide complete services,

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:28.170
and the division of our labor
is well-balanced.

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:31.580
From planning, to financial planning,
to executing, and to overseeing,

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:32.700
I do all of that alone.

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:34.420
That's amazing.

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:36.620
I have a part-timer as well,
which is Miss Shen Mingzhu.

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:39.260
I have no choice.
Workforce is expensive nowadays.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:40.220
I can't afford to hire people.

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:42.260
Usually, we establish
a corporate partnership with others

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:43.540
after receiving an order.

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:45.940
Are you a contractor?

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:49.340
You can think of it that way.

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:50.900
But in our industry,

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:52.380
it's called...

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:53.580
An operation.

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:54.340
That's right.

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:56.140
And, since we're friends,

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:56.860
I'll let you in on a secret.

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:58.680
You guys can save money
on this part as well.

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.420
It's currently
the peak season for weddings.

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:02.020
Hiring a wedding host
will be very costly.

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:03.900
Therefore,
it's highly advised for you guys

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:05.500
to bring your own
wedding host friend to the wedding.

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:08.050
It'll be easier to communicate
what you want with them as well.

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:10.060
We had a job before this.

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:11.780
They hired their ex-coursemate

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:12.820
to host their wedding.

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:14.020
The wedding

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:15.500
was just like a nostalgia party.

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:16.460
It was so touching.

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:18.820
Among the people we know,

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:20.740
I suppose my sister
is the most eloquent one.

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:22.260
Why don't we ask your sister, then?

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:25.380
She's pregnant. How can she go on stage?

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.580
I don't know a lot of people either.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:30.620
We don't have many friends, do we?

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:33.020
I'm reminded of one person.

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:33.780
Who?

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:34.860
Dr. Li.

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.930
He was the one who hosted their school's
100th year anniversary celebration.

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:39.860
He could both host and perform surgery.

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:41.300
Perform surgery?

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:43.020
A doctor?

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.910
He is an obstetrician and gynecologist
at the People's Hospital.

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:47.220
Do you remember last time?

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:49.380
He didn't get to host
Uncle's birthday banquet.

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:50.780
I think he was pretty disappointed.

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:52.860
Great. We can ask him to come, then.

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:53.700
Listen,

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.620
it'll cost 5,000 yuan to hire
a top-tier emcee.

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:56.780
But you can hire him for free.

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:58.540
But this is my wedding.

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:01.500
Yeah. Wouldn't this be strange?

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:04.060
Are you guys dumb?

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:06.500
He's an obstetrician-gynecologist.

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:08.380
You guys will have a child soon.

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:10.700
And, he's just the guy you need.

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:12.340
You guys need to butter him up.

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:14.900
Let's invite Dr. Li, then.

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:17.140
Are we able to?

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:19.020
What about this?

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:21.180
Let's buy Dr. Li a meal first.

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:23.300
And, we'll invite Zhixia as well.

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:24.700
Someone's here.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:26.500
I threw up a lot.

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:27.380
I think it's related to my age...

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:27.980
Dr. Li.

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:29.420
Dr. Li is here.

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:29.780
Miss?

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:30.860
Here, have a seat.

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:32.460
Is soda water okay?

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:33.340
Yeah.

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:37.420
I rushed here after work.

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:38.700
Mingzhu said you guys
had something to discuss.

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:39.380
What is it?

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:40.660
We do have something to discuss.

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:41.740
It's important.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:43.260
It's her wedding.

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:47.420
This is our future sister-in-law,

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:48.020
Bichen.

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:48.900
Hello, Dr. Li.

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:49.860
Hello.

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:52.100
We met before.

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:54.340
What's wrong? Was she unable
to receive my consultation?

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:56.050
Not at all. It's easy
to receive your consultation.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.500
Look at her.
She doesn't even let me brag.

00:13:58.500 --> 00:13:59.860
You may go ahead.

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:01.180
It's like this.

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:03.180
Bichen and my brother

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:04.500
will get married soon.

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:07.220
Therefore, we wish to invite you

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:08.500
to hold down their fort.

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:09.700
Hold down their fort?

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:12.100
That is to host their wedding.

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:12.860
Host their wedding?

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.900
Aren't you the poster child
for the art stream?

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:16.460
I was merely bragging.

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:17.620
Didn't you host your school's

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:18.540
100th year anniversary celebration?

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:19.820
There were over 10 hosts there.

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:20.940
I stood at the very edge.

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:21.580
I can't do it.

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:23.940
Dr. Li, please don't be modest.

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:27.060
We've already seen your achievements
on the People's Hospital's website.

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:28.180
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:30.460
You've been hosting
their annual meeting every year.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:33.380
Dr. Li, I truly think Nanzhou has plenty of
talented individuals,

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:35.100
just like you.

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:35.740
Dr. Li.

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:39.820
It's not an exaggeration to call you
the top dog at People's Hospital, right?

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:41.220
Miss, that's over-exaggerating it.

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:44.420
You guys are buying me a meal

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:46.060
and buttering me up together.

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:48.380
It's obvious
that I can't just refuse your request.

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:49.860
If so, I suppose that's a yes, then.

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:52.220
Thank you, Dr. Li.

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:53.940
- Stop.
- Thank you.

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:56.020
Dr. Li, you're truly multi-talented.

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:57.540
You're both virtuous and talented.

00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:00.100
I'll say this first.

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.170
It's just like a briefing I do
before any surgery.

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:04.100
After all, I'm not a professional.

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:06.380
You may encounter
the following situations.

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:08.820
Firstly, I might forget the script
when I get too nervous.

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:09.900
Therefore, at that moment,

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:11.980
I need the mood-makers to help me out.

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:12.580
I'll do it.

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:15.620
Great. Secondly, I might go on for too long
when I get excited.

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:16.380
Please forgive me for that.

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:17.500
That's fine. I'll be around.

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:18.860
Okay. Thirdly,

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:20.580
if I accept any urgent calls

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:21.940
from the ER,

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:23.620
I'll stop the hosting immediately.

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:24.740
You guys have to prepare a backup plan.

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:25.460
Dr. Li,

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:27.260
we're clear with

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:28.820
every one of your situations.

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:32.020
Should we sign a pre-hosting agreement?

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:32.860
It's fine. No need for that.

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:34.060
That'll be unnecessary.

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:35.140
We can chat while we eat.

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:35.660
Okay.

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:36.700
Dr. Li.

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:38.460
Here. Warm your belly with some soup.

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:38.940
Okay. Thank you.

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:40.780
- You've been busy the entire day.
- Okay.

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:42.340
My bowl is already full.

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:44.500
So, why did you guys

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:45.700
want me to be the host?

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:47.980
It's because Mingzhu
strongly recommended you.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.340
Although we're friends,

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:52.660
I do have high respect for you.

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:53.940
Do you still remember?

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:55.140
When I had a cornual pregnancy,

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:56.660
I was truly afraid back then.

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:58.100
But you kept consoling me.

00:15:58.500 --> 00:15:59.700
Zhixia's mother did the same.

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:02.180
You were the one who saved me
when I was bleeding profusely.

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:02.900
I was just doing my duty.

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:04.940
To us ordinary folks,

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:07.500
doctors like you all are our guardians.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:09.340
I no longer have the chance.

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:10.580
If I did have the chance,

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:12.250
I would've liked for you
to host my wedding as well.

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:15.980
The love journey
of Bichen and my brother

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:17.420
was pretty difficult as well.

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:19.100
Now, everything has settled down.

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:21.700
Therefore, Dr. Li,
we hope that you can host their wedding.

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:23.130
And our baby's 100th-day celebration.

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:24.180
And their baby's
first birthday celebration.

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:26.020
Why don't you host
the baby's wedding as well?

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:27.100
I suppose I would be venerable

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:28.340
and highly respected back then.

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:29.980
By then, it'll be hard
to receive your consultation.

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:31.720
Wait, do I still need
to work at that time?

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:32.740
Come.

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:34.660
Let's drink tea instead of liquor.

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:35.180
Alright.

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:38.140
To the well-respected
and venerable Dr. Li!

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:38.660
Alright!

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:40.460
May you do well in your career!

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:41.960
Alright. I'll also do my best

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:43.860
to give the newlywed couple
the perfect wedding.

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:45.100
Thank you.

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:49.900
I think this package is pretty good.

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:51.220
(Bridal Package)
It has a complimentary luxury suite too.

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.460
It's still too expensive.

00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:57.740
Miss Feng,

00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:00.220
can we get a discount?

00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:03.500
This package is already
the most thoughtful bridal package

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:05.220
offered by our hotel.

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.380
We also provide a lot of
complimentary packages.

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:08.540
It's worth the experience.

00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:10.700
Give us a discount.

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:12.480
We're hosting a banquet
for 200 people here.

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:15.580
If so, I'll request the hotel

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:17.100
to give you guys a bottle of

00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:19.060
complimentary French champagne
worth 888 yuan.

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:19.660
How about it?

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:20.980
What do you think?

00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:23.180
The champagne isn't worth it.

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:26.300
Why don't you give us

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:27.900
a 888-yuan discount directly?

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:30.020
Mister, I'm sorry.

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:31.420
That won't do.

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:32.940
Why not?

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:34.730
Just try to apply for it
with your superiors.

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:35.700
Try asking them.

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:38.020
My superiors have already
gotten off work.

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:39.620
You guys are in the service industry.

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:41.140
To think that you guys
have fixed working hours.

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.550
Even a machine needs to recharge
their batteries, you know?

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:45.100
What attitude is that?

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:47.460
Is this how your hotel does business?

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:50.140
You guys are belittling us just because

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:52.250
we're inquiring about
the cheapest bridal package, huh?

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:54.980
Dear, let's find another place.

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:56.500
We won't do business with them.

00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:57.540
Let's go.

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:00.140
Take the coffee.

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:04.460
Meiqi.

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:05.860
Wait.

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.100
How is it? Did you clinch the deal?

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:10.820
No, I didn't.

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:12.320
They thought it was too expensive.

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:15.660
You have to explain it to the clients.

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:16.980
Our services are expensive for a reason.

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:18.460
I've already explained
everything I needed to.

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:20.040
They still thought it was too expensive.

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:21.940
Meiqi,

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:24.910
everyone knows
that you come from a well-off family.

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:27.220
It's like you don't care
about your commission at all

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:28.660
But I hope you'll understand this.

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:32.420
You can only do a good job
if you care about the job.

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:36.300
I heard that Nanxi Hotel

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:38.100
has taken away
a lot of our business lately.

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:40.260
I heard that the retro bridal banquet

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:43.300
created by two of their female employees
was all the craze.

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:44.660
Meiqi,

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:47.740
you're an elite graduate
who came back from overseas.

00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:49.860
You should put more effort into it.

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:52.340
If you don't hit this season's KPI,

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:54.740
we'll get us in trouble.

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:00.820
Your shrimp is ready.

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:01.420
Please enjoy your meal.

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:02.460
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:04.500
Dr. Li,

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:07.060
once we're done with Bichen's wedding,

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:08.980
I'll do my best
to find you a girlfriend.

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:09.620
No thanks.

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:10.980
Were you single all this time?

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:12.350
I once had a girlfriend.

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:14.460
Dr. Li is a golden bachelor.

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:15.780
I'm famous for being single.

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:16.660
Don't worry.

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:18.780
That'll change once I help him out.

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:19.900
Miss, no need for that.

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:21.580
I think I'm leading a carefree life

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:22.900
as a single man.

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:23.740
Once I marry someone,

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:25.300
I'll gain a lot of new relatives.

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:27.060
Life is already troublesome enough.

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:28.940
If I do so, it'll only make
my life more troublesome.

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:30.300
Everyone here is
a relative of one another.

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:31.580
I'll ask you for a favor,
and you'll ask me for a favor.

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:32.580
Isn't that fun?

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:34.700
Don't take it for real.

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:36.340
Zhixia was just joking with you.

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:38.220
You can live however you want to live.

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:38.820
Alright.

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:40.580
Here, have some shrimp.

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:46.980
What's the matter?

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.380
This is the first time
someone has peeled my shrimp from me

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:53.820
since I was a child.

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:23.060
Meiqi.

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:24.180
Mom?

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:25.500
What's the matter?

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:27.900
I was looking at you from above.

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:29.220
You've been sitting here
for a while now.

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:30.380
Why didn't you come upstairs?

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:32.780
And,

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:35.340
why didn't you drive to work today?

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.100
I was quite tired.
I didn't feel like driving.

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:44.540
Are you upset with something?

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:48.180
That's not it. You see...

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:52.500
The sales performance of our hotel's
current season isn't looking good.

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:54.420
My boss gave me some pressure.

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:57.420
But I thought I was
already working hard enough.

00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:59.250
I even worked overtime
to serve additional customers.

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:00.140
Precisely.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:01.460
You came back very late.

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:04.740
And, I couldn't hit my KPI

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:06.940
because the people of Nanzhou
don't like to spend money.

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:09.380
The couple I served today thought
our packages were expensive too.

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:10.350
Bichen thought the same.

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:14.160
It's impossible to communicate
when our perceptions are different.

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:17.220
Silly girl,

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:18.940
were you upset over this?

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:21.180
I told you long ago.

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:23.380
You could quit
if you're unhappy with your job.

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:25.340
Our family doesn't
need your wage anyway.

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:26.580
Mom.

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:28.220
Meiqi?

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:29.540
What are you guys doing here?

00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:30.100
Mingzhu,

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:31.740
why did you come back this late?

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:33.500
A friend of mine was pregnant too.

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:35.780
I took her out to have a meal
with Dr. Li today.

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:36.700
Dr. Li?

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:42.540
Mingzhu,

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:44.620
this is a reminder.

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:47.940
You're pregnant with the grandchild of
the Feng family, you know?

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:50.220
Mom.

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:51.540
Mom,

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:53.640
you're kicking a huge fuss over nothing.

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:54.620
She just went out to socialize.

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:56.650
It has nothing to do
with whose child she's pregnant with.

00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:58.140
What are you saying?

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:00.860
We sent you to England
for your studies, you know?

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:02.820
Were such twisted values
all you've learned over there?

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:04.420
Mom, that's not it.

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:06.780
Values aren't decided by
your preferences alone.

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:09.020
Yes, I did go to England
to see the world.

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:10.100
I did broaden my horizons.

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:10.940
But in the end?

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:13.040
I still had no choice
but to stay cooped up in Nanzhou.

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:14.300
I had to work under pressure
even during overtime shifts.

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:16.200
And, I might be making less money
than Hu Gang.

00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:18.140
Are you saying
that we're dragging you down?

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:21.220
I didn't say that.

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:22.340
If so, what were you implying, then?

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:23.900
What's wrong with coming back?
Is it bad to come back?

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:25.300
I think it's great.

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:27.300
You have everything you need at home.

00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:29.220
And, we know Hu Gang inside out.

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:30.620
He's a good potential partner for you.

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:31.380
He's good for you in every way.

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:32.860
Who said so? He's bad for me in every way!

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:33.540
Meiqi,

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:34.860
stop it.

00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:37.140
Mom has a point.

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:38.700
Are you serious?

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:39.660
I was speaking up for you.

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:41.060
Can you have some spine for once?

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:43.020
Don't you understand what Mom
was trying to imply?

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:44.260
She even said I had twisted values.

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:45.380
Who said her values weren't twisted?

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:46.780
What did I say?

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:48.660
What did you mean by that?

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:51.180
Do you know what era we're living in?

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:52.260
Women should be independent now.

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:53.780
Don't delude yourself into thinking
that you can gain prestige through me.

00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:55.100
What are you saying?

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:56.060
Feng Meiqi!

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:56.860
Stop right there!

00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:57.420
Mom.

00:22:58.340 --> 00:22:59.620
That's how Meiqi is.

00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:00.740
A strong independent woman.

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:01.860
Strong independent woman?

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:03.580
She's just spoiled by her father.

00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:05.940
And you,

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:08.900
you're pregnant now.

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:11.380
You shouldn't
wear yourself out like that.

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:12.620
But I feel fine.

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:15.500
Since when did I tell the teacher
to send Tangtang to the hospital?

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:15.980
What about you?

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:17.420
Have you ever sent her
to the hospital before?

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:21.020
Meiqi, you're back.

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:22.460
Dad.

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:25.500
I think Shen Mingzhu went overboard.

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:27.340
What did she do again?

00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:29.500
She had dinner with Dr. Li just now.

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:31.740
Mom said the same thing
after hearing about it.

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:33.500
She told her
to mind her conduct and so on.

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:35.020
I spoke up for her
out of kind intention.

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:36.450
But she didn't appreciate it at all.

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:38.460
Your mother mentioned it again?

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:40.900
My goodness.

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:44.060
Alright now.

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:46.940
Mingzhu is a sensible girl.

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:49.540
Perhaps she did so
to not hurt your mother's emotions.

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:50.860
Even so, she can't just
disregard her principles

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:52.100
because of that.

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:54.780
Silly girl,

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:56.980
this isn't the court.

00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:58.500
Principles aren't essential here.

00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:01.500
At home, we emphasize warmth.

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:02.900
We emphasize our bond.

00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:06.300
When you encounter something
like this in the future,

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:08.260
just bow down and accept it.

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:10.260
Just turn a blind eye to it

00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:11.420
and let it pass.

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:15.580
You should learn from Mingzhu.

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:18.060
I cannot.

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:19.460
And I will never learn this.

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:29.100
(Nanzhou First People's Hospital)

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:33.180
Waist circumference, 78.

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:34.780
The baby's growth is encouraging.

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:39.860
He kicks me in the belly every day.

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:41.140
He's quite strong.

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:43.220
Alright. We just need to wait for
the blood test report.

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:44.580
Just hand this to your doctor.

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:45.660
Alright. Thank you.

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:49.500
Mom.

00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:50.820
Is everything done?

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:51.660
Everything's fine.

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:53.210
This is the blood test report.

00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:55.620
I'll hand it over to the doctor later.

00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:58.460
It's Dr. Li, huh?

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:00.780
(Gynecological Clinic)

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:02.740
What? That's pretty good.

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:04.180
Walk slowly.

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:05.380
I'm fine.

00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:06.620
Your father thought

00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:08.740
that you guys would be running out
of chili oil by now.

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:09.700
This is for your father-in-law.

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:10.700
What? That's so much.

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:12.340
When will I be able to finish this?

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:14.180
Just keep it in the fridge.
You can enjoy it slowly.

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:15.220
It won't spoil.

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:17.100
Don't leave it lying.

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:21.340
It might spill. Let it stand.

00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:21.940
Okay, I'll let it stand.

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:23.780
No. 45, Shen Mingzhu,

00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:25.420
please head to Consultation Room 8.

00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:26.140
It's my turn.

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:29.020
Wait here.

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:30.380
Dr. Li.

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:31.710
Hello, Mrs. Shen.

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:33.300
Mom, just sit down.

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:37.340
Were you busy today?

00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:38.980
Yeah. I barely have time to take a sip.

00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:40.060
Let me see.

00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:40.460
Okay.

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:47.080
Everything looks good.

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:49.020
Get ready to be a mother.

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:50.620
Okay.

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:52.140
I need some vitamins.

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:52.740
Okay.

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:13.300
Li Jingzhe.

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:14.980
You'll pay with your life today!

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:16.340
Calm down!

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:17.220
- Someone else is here.
- Calm down?

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:17.940
Enough.

00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:19.300
You want me to calm down? Do you know
how many times I've been here?

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:20.380
Everyone will perish here

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:21.500
unless you compensate me!

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:22.020
I know that.

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:23.580
Can you let the other patient
out of the room first?

00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:25.490
- There's a patient here. Let her out.
- Listen up!

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:26.300
You want to let her out?

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:27.060
No one is allowed to leave!

00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:29.060
Do you know why we're here
to look for you again?

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:29.940
Mingzhu!

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:30.940
You just didn't manage
to scam me of my money.

00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:31.780
What scam?

00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:33.420
- Open the door!
- Don't hurt anyone!

00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:34.380
No one is allowed to leave!

00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:35.300
Who said she could leave?

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:36.660
No one is allowed to leave!

00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:38.300
There's another patient in here!

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:39.460
I don't care if someone else is in here!

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:40.620
Let's make things clear today!

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:41.660
Enough. What about this?

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:42.860
There's another patient in here.

00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:44.540
Do you know why we're here
to look for you?

00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:45.660
You just didn't manage
to scam me of my money.

00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:46.780
What scam?

00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:47.700
Don't hurt anyone!

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:49.340
Nurse!

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:50.020
Over here!

00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:50.620
Hurry!

00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:52.020
- Call for help!
- Security!

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:52.900
Call for security!

00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:54.060
Call the cops!

00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:55.260
Someone's causing a ruckus here!

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:55.980
How long will you hide?

00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:57.660
Our child died

00:26:58.180 --> 00:26:59.340
because of you!

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:00.660
- You failed to scam us!
- Your hospital...

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:01.540
You just failed to scam us, right?

00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:02.380
What scam?

00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:04.980
Listen up! Your hospital
has to bear the responsibility!

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:06.580
Don't hurt anyone!

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:10.580
You guys have to
bear the responsibility!

00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:11.900
I told you already!
It wasn't a case of medical malpractice!

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:13.220
Everything was stated clearly
on the medical report!

00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:15.020
What medical report?
We don't trust that!

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:18.380
We don't trust the medical report!

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:20.140
Did you know that?

00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:21.460
Dr. Li, duck!

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:29.740
Open the door! If not,
I'll break the window!

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:30.840
Get out of the way! I...

00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:32.140
Hurry!

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:33.300
That's enough!

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:34.560
Stop right there! Don't run!

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:36.500
Mrs. Shen!

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:37.740
How dare you bully my daughter?

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:38.460
Mrs. Shen, you mustn't!

00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:39.780
Let me beat him to death!

00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:40.840
Don't take it away!

00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:41.660
You mustn't!

00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:43.060
- Mrs. Shen! Stop!
- Come back!

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:43.780
Mom!

00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:45.980
You'll be locked up too
if you go overboard!

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:47.340
Are you okay?

00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:48.140
I'm fine.

00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:52.980
Is that blood? Are you bleeding?

00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:54.660
It's not blood.

00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:55.860
It's chili oil.

00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:57.380
Mom, it's just chili oil.

00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:00.140
That was terrifying...

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:01.420
My girl!

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:02.540
Mom, I'm fine.

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:04.180
You scared me!

00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:05.180
Everything's fine.

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:09.660
Dr. Li, is there a surveillance camera
in your room?

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:11.020
No, there isn't.

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:12.620
I have one.

00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:15.360
I recorded the entire incident.

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:18.460
I'll make some chilled black fungus.

00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:20.260
That's enough.

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:23.980
I'll make four cold and four hot dishes.

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:27.540
After that, I'll head to Shen's place

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:29.180
and get two signature dishes of his.

00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:31.420
After that, I'll come back
and prepare two quick dishes.

00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:32.220
That's all.

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:37.260
This is our son-in-law's first visit.

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:39.540
We must prepare everything.

00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:40.340
But,

00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:42.700
we shouldn't be too passionate as well.
Understood?

00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:44.620
Hu Gang knows Ni Debao.

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:48.020
How would they know each other?

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:50.500
Hu Gang is Minghui's class teacher.

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:52.200
When the school
wanted to see the parents,

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:53.440
Minghui asked my father to go.

00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:01.100
No wonder Yue Xiu'e told her off.

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:02.020
Great job.

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:04.340
Ni Debao must be out of her mind.

00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:06.540
He went out of his way
to pretend to be someone else's father.

00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:08.060
He deserved to be told off.

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:09.740
I managed to get

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:11.740
Hu Gang's WeChat contact
all thanks to Ni Debao.

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:14.300
Mom.

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:16.500
Ni Debao's portrait

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:18.060
is still hanging on our wall.

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:20.460
Do you think Mr. Hu can
continue our relationship

00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:21.380
when he comes here

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:22.980
and sees the portrait on the wall?

00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:25.100
Do you remember the six units?

00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:30.100
Yeah.

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:33.380
And, I think my father
has to participate in this too.

00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:35.720
After all, it's a good thing
for both parents to be alive.

00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:36.620
Come.

00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:37.900
As the head of the family,

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:40.020
let's offer Mr. Hu a toast.

00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:41.420
- Thank you, mister.
- To Mr. Hu. Here.

00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:42.260
Thank you, mister.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.180
Here. Don't stand on ceremony.

00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:48.940
Alright.

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:50.820
It's been so long
since I had this beef dish.

00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:53.300
Mr. Hu.

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:54.740
Here, have some sliced beef.

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:55.540
Okay.

00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:56.300
It's delicious.

00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:57.020
Thank you, madam.

00:29:57.180 --> 00:29:58.060
Mr. Hu.

00:29:58.260 --> 00:29:59.500
Try this pork chop.

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:01.580
I heard that you guys
couldn't get it in school

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:02.700
even if you queued for it.

00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:03.620
That's right.

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:05.140
Thank you, mister.

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:09.980
Mr. Hu, I heard that both of your parents
were in the education industry.

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:12.950
He comes from a family of educators.
They have students everywhere.

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:15.340
Both of my parents are
High school teachers.

00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:17.020
My mother teaches languages

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:18.540
while my father teaches Math.

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:21.300
They're well-versed in both
science and art stream.

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:23.950
Dad, don't you think
he's a great match for our family?

00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:25.020
Yeah.

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:25.860
Just look at him.

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:30.060
Like parents, like son indeed.

00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:31.180
You flatter me.

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:32.820
You see, my parents are...

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:35.340
Sorry about that.

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:36.100
Go ahead.

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:40.220
Hey, mind your words.

00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:42.300
Not everything is Mahjong, you know?

00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:43.500
But what I said was true.

00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:45.750
Shut up. How can you still speak
when your mouth is full?

00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:47.900
Sorry about that, mister and madam.

00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:48.860
I've already put it on silent mode.

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:50.020
That's fine. Work is more important.

00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:50.900
Work is important.

00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:54.620
As I was saying,

00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:57.460
they're teaching at
Beiqiao High School.

00:30:57.700 --> 00:30:58.780
And, my father

00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:00.780
is teaching
the senior year classes as well.

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:03.330
So, your entire family is born
to educate people for the NCEE.

00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:04.100
That's right.

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:06.100
Mister, you might not know,

00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:08.740
but I have to be on my guard around them

00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:10.340
whenever I go home now.

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:12.260
Over the past two years,
our Nanzhou High School

00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:13.620
has maintained a graduation rate

00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:15.660
comparable to that
of Beiqiao High School.

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:17.020
We're competing with each other.

00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:19.300
Whenever I go home,

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:21.540
my parents will inquire about
the average score

00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:23.140
for our school's mock exam.

00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:25.700
If so, Comrade Hu,

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:26.580
did you tell them?

00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:28.300
Of course not.

00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:29.300
Over your dead body.

00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:30.460
Am I right?

00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:33.980
Here, Mr. Hu.

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:34.780
Thank you, mister.

00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:35.940
Please help yourself.

00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:37.460
Mr. Hu is a cultured person,

00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:38.660
just like me.

00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:52.020
Mr. Hu,

00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:54.340
I don't know if Ni has introduced us

00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:55.980
to you before.

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:01.140
My wife

00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:03.980
works at the Civil Affairs Bureau.

00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:06.380
She's hardworking and earnest.

00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:09.780
And, she's a great cook.

00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:12.380
She was also gorgeous

00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:13.460
when she was young.

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:16.660
People call her
Blooming Flower of the Heritage City.

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:18.660
I suppose I got myself the wrong spouse.

00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:22.860
As to why she got married to me,

00:32:23.150 --> 00:32:24.500
I suppose it's obvious enough.

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:27.060
I learned how to
read pulses since young.

00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:28.980
The clinic opposite our house is mine.

00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:33.020
When you mention the name Debao
in Heritage City,

00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:34.300
everyone knows about it.

00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:35.340
Enough already.

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:36.220
Stop bragging.

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:36.900
Here.

00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:38.260
I'm not bragging here.

00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:41.860
Your family has students
all over the world

00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:44.120
while our family treats patients
from all over the world.

00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:45.100
That's enough.

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:46.580
Mr. Hu, here.

00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:47.380
Let's have a drink.

00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:49.340
Let's welcome Mr. Hu.

00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:50.580
Thank you, mister and madam.

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:52.380
Please visit us often in the future.

00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:57.580
Mr. Hu,

00:32:57.860 --> 00:32:58.540
look.

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:02.580
That's the refraction of light.

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:05.700
Look where my finger is pointing.

00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:11.340
(Ni's Clinic)
One-stop burial services?

00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:13.340
My father owns that.

00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:18.660
I suppose it's one-stop indeed.

00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:21.740
Did you see the portrait as well?

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:28.100
Actually, my parents
were divorced long ago.

00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:30.660
They've been arguing from the start.

00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:32.820
Therefore, my father remarried.

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:34.540
He lives opposite my house.

00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:36.980
I have a younger sister called Xiaoni.

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:39.660
You have a younger sister as well?

00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:41.380
She's adorable.

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:42.740
You'll meet her eventually.

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:46.260
But my mother refused
to accept this outcome.

00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:47.780
Therefore, she hung
a black and white portrait

00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:48.860
of my father on the wall.

00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:51.380
You see,

00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:54.140
this is the true journey
of my "wonderful" life.

00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:56.980
Do you still dare
to explore it further with me?

00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:04.300
Initially,

00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:06.380
I didn't.

00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:08.820
However,

00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:11.060
after today's meal,

00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:15.020
I don't think that's a huge deal.

00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:19.020
You brat.

00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:27.220
If so, your uncle's acting
was pretty convincing.

00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:30.340
He's very prideful.
Don't expose him, okay?

00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:36.620
The bride's father will
hold his daughter's hand

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:38.540
and walk toward the groom slowly.

00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:40.260
Groom, slow down.

00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:41.420
I know you're impatient,

00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:42.750
but you aren't going to work here.

00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:46.300
Walk toward each other slowly.

00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:50.740
Maintain your smile.

00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:54.860
The bride's father will

00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:57.580
hand his daughter's hand to the groom.

00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:00.260
Xu Zhidong.

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:02.780
You'd better be nice to Bichen.

00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:04.120
If not, I won't let you off.

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:07.340
Extend your arm.

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:09.700
Do you actually think
that you're her father?

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:10.460
I am!

00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:12.020
Alright.

00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:14.540
You two may now exchange your vows.

00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:16.060
Our vows?

00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:17.260
What should I say?

00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:18.540
What should we say?

00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:20.980
Getting married is so tiring.

00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:22.060
Even my back is sweaty.

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:23.340
How was our performance?

00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:25.060
- Come.
- He was terrible.

00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:25.620
Bride.

00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:27.020
Come, I'll touch up on your makeup.

00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:29.780
When the lighting hits you,
your lipstick won't be visible.

00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:31.020
We need to apply more lipstick to you.

00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:32.540
And, we need to fix your brows too.

00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:33.820
You're so professional.

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:35.700
Bichen, are you tired?

00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:36.700
Is the baby reacting?

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:38.020
Not for now.

00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:39.180
I just feel sleepy all the time.

00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:40.700
That's normal. I feel sleepy too.

00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:43.740
What does the groom need to do, then?

00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:45.060
Nothing. You just need to rest.

00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:47.380
Manager,

00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:49.340
take a look.

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:53.140
We've finished all the decoration

00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:55.140
as per this blueprint.

00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:56.500
Have some water.

00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:57.980
Thank you.

00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:00.140
You may leave first if you're busy.

00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:01.620
I don't think I'll be done that quickly.

00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:02.500
I'm free anyway.

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:04.540
Don't you need to
go on a date with Mr. Hu?

00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:06.980
He's unromantic.
I couldn't care less about him.

00:36:07.795 --> 00:36:09.675
If so, you should educate him.

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:10.900
Why should I?

00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:12.340
He can learn by himself.

00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:22.980
Turn around. Let me see.

00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:28.220
I think a light and elegant makeup style

00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:29.620
suits Bichen better.

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:32.660
The first set she'll wear
is their wedding attire.

00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:33.820
Light makeup isn't appropriate.

00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:35.780
Look at all the fancy decorations.

00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:37.860
We have to emphasize her radiance.

00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:41.500
Nanzhou is a small place indeed.

00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:44.140
The makeup of newlywed couples
are too thick.

00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:45.050
It's not classy at all.

00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:48.260
Do you guys usually go out
for further training?

00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:50.260
For example, to France, Korea, or so on?

00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:51.850
We usually go to Tieling
for further training.

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:54.460
Actually, I think it's fine.

00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:56.100
My parents like bright red makeup.

00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:03.540
This is such a festive color.

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:05.420
It's my first time trying this.

00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:06.220
Yeah, right?

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:07.350
It does look good on you.

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:13.860
Manager, I think there's something wrong
with the PA system.

00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:15.100
Let me see.

00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:16.540
Go and switch it off first.

00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:17.380
- Yeah, switch it off first.
- Okay.

00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:19.580
I guess it's a contact issue.

00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:20.620
Let me check.

00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:24.300
Is it due to the poor contact?

00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:25.500
Let me see.

00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:27.140
This shouldn't be.

00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:27.860
I told you already.

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:28.740
Is it an issue with the circuit?

00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:29.860
You shouldn't be frugal
when it comes to your wedding.

00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:30.980
I can't resolve this issue.

00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:32.350
We have to find
the maintenance department.

00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:35.140
It's lunch hour for the technicians now.

00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:36.060
That's fine.

00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:37.950
We don't need music, then.
I'll take it as a compromise.

00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:39.180
How can you compromise?

00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:41.060
It's your wedding. It should be perfect.

00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:42.090
We shouldn't compromise.

00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:44.180
No problem. It's not a huge issue.

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:46.560
I'll hire someone to fix it for you.

00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:47.700
Will you call for Hu Gang?

00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:49.940
No need for that, Meiqi.

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:51.780
Our technician will come back
at 1:30 P.M.

00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:53.530
It's fine. Mingzhu, you have no idea.

00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:54.940
Hu Gang was waiting for
Meiqi to call him.

00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:56.300
This way, he'll have an out.

00:37:56.660 --> 00:37:58.380
I'm sure he'll come later.

00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:04.140
(Meiqi)

00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:09.940
(Meiqi)

00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:13.380
Hello?

00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:14.380
Hello, Mr. Hu.

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:15.700
What took you so long?

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:17.540
Listen.

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:20.460
My best friend is going through her
wedding rehearsal at Nanxi Hotel now.

00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:22.330
But there's something wrong
with the PA system.

00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:23.780
Come here and fix it.

00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:27.020
What seems to be the issue?

00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:30.140
Is it just static noise?
Or is it a screech?

00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:31.900
How would I know?

00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:32.580
Meiqi,

00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:34.020
I'll explain it to Mr. Hu.

00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:35.160
I'll explain it to him.

00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:37.860
Hello, Mr. Hu?

00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:39.140
I'm Mingzhu.

00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:41.100
Sorry for the trouble.

00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:42.060
It's like this.

00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:44.860
The PA equipment we rented for
Ni Wedding Planning

00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:46.860
is quite dated.

00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:50.620
Ni Wedding Planning?

00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:51.860
Yeah.

00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:54.060
Since you're in the
wedding-planning industry,

00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:56.160
the equipment really has to be
upgraded and updated.

00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:57.410
What if something goes wrong

00:38:57.410 --> 00:38:58.210
- during the wedding?
- Okay.

00:38:58.220 --> 00:38:59.820
The newlywed will regret it
for the rest of their lives.

00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:01.740
If something goes wrong,
we can just fix it.

00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:03.020
You're already looking for help
as we speak.

00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:04.100
What if I can't find any help?

00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:05.100
How could that be?

00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:06.100
You already called him personally.

00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:07.380
I'm sure he would come.

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:09.500
Meiqi,

00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:12.300
Mr. Hu is tutoring the students now.

00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:13.660
He won't be able to come for now.

00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:26.780
Hu Gang.

00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:28.940
Are you sure you're not free?

00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:30.220
Are you sure about that?

00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:36.660
You'd better think twice.

00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:40.860
Senior year teachers are always busy.

00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:42.380
The NCEE is a huge deal, you know?

00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:44.660
Yeah.
I'm sure Mr. Hu is anxious about it too.

00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:46.060
It's impossible to be filial
and loyal at the same time.

00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:47.340
What nonsense is that?

00:39:47.350 --> 00:39:49.380
I'm not his mother.
Why should he be filial to me?

00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:54.220
I have a report to hand in
this afternoon.

00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:55.160
I'll make a move first.

00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:56.420
You should go ahead.

00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:57.220
You guys can continue.

00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:57.740
Goodbye.

00:39:58.020 --> 00:39:59.380
Goodbye.

00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:01.740
Get rid of your lousy equipment
as soon as possible.

00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:02.700
Sure.

00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:05.040
You should expand your poor connections
as soon as possible too.

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:07.020
What are you laughing at?

00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:08.700
You want the issue to blow up?

00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:09.700
What are you laughing at?

00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:12.100
Your sister-in-law is so mean.

00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:13.300
Only you guys can tolerate her.

00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:15.580
Meiqi led a pampered life since young.

00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:16.620
She's pretty willful.

00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:17.700
But she's quite nice.

00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:20.320
Yeah. She came to my rehearsal
when she heard that I needed help.

00:40:20.330 --> 00:40:21.540
I would rather she didn't come.

00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:22.340
When she's here,

00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:24.260
we have to serve her like a mistress.

00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:25.500
That's because
you feel guilty toward her.

00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:25.980
I...

00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:28.420
But we have to remind her

00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:29.660
that she's just a bridesmaid.

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:31.980
What if she gets infuriated
during the wedding?

00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:32.980
Yeah.

00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:35.340
What should we do if she causes trouble

00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:36.100
during our wedding?

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:37.180
There's nothing to worry about.

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:38.300
I'm here, aren't I?

00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:39.860
I can do what Meiqi can do.

00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:41.700
I can even do what she cannot.

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:43.220
Stop fanning the flames.

00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:44.380
I'm not.

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:45.980
I'm just making a statement here.

00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:50.660
Hu Gang.

00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:52.540
All clear at Nanxi Hotel.

00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:53.680
Come as soon as possible.

00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:56.220
Who?

00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:57.540
Hu Gang?

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:01.060
You two...

00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:02.980
That's right. It's us now.

00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:06.540
Meiqi,

00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:07.980
I sent you the marketing plan

00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:09.980
from last Thanksgiving.

00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:12.380
Modify it and make one
for this year's Thanksgiving.

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:14.060
You have to be detailed.

00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:15.700
Do it immediately. I need it urgently.

00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:17.860
Got it, Samantha.

00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:33.820
It seems Mr. Hu doesn't have the guts
to refuse me after all.

00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:38.500
Mr. Hu,

00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:39.380
I think it's fixed.

00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:40.140
Is there sound now?

00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:41.950
Hear it and
see if there's any static noise.

00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:43.140
Nope.

00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:43.940
Nope, huh?

00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:47.660
All done.

00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:49.980
Mr. Hu,

00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:51.180
thank you for coming today.

00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:52.060
You're such a professional.

00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:53.220
Even the technicians

00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:54.380
might not be able to fix this.

00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:56.940
This is an issue with
the transmission cable.

00:41:56.940 --> 00:41:59.420
It's because the console
is too far away from the sound system.

00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:00.740
It'll be fine once you change it

00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:01.550
to a balanced input.

00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:02.980
Thank you, Mr. Hu.

00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:05.540
Not only is Mr. Hu intelligent,

00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:07.140
but he's also very handy.

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:08.860
Here. A preserved plum as your reward.

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:10.660
It's your reward.

00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:11.660
Isn't it sweet?

00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:13.860
It is.

00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:14.420
Isn't it?

00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:18.180
Did Mr. Hu have a relationship
with Meiqi before this?

00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:20.380
That's already in the past.

00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:22.620
How did we end up with a love triangle

00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:24.180
on our wedding rehearsal?

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:25.100
How should I know?

00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:30.460
Hu Gang,

00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:31.660
our home Wi-Fi is down.

00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:33.540
Our Al home system has collapsed.

00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:35.100
Please come and fix it.

00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:39.140
That shouldn't be.

00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:41.660
I installed their Wi-Fi for them.

00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:42.660
It shouldn't be possible.
