WEBVTT

00:01:14.385 --> 00:01:16.066
Our top priority is to find the golden lock

00:01:17.036 --> 00:01:18.957
Only in this way can Lin Er smooth out the plot.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.487
to go back

00:01:26.594 --> 00:01:27.352
no problem

00:01:27.695 --> 00:01:29.256
The more we all have, the more strength we have

00:01:29.466 --> 00:01:30.507
Let's find it now

00:01:30.915 --> 00:01:32.115
But the crowd is huge

00:01:32.428 --> 00:01:33.524
Where to find it?

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:39.405
Lin'er

00:01:40.987 --> 00:01:43.026
You should know the most about golden locks

00:01:43.199 --> 00:01:43.852
Um

00:01:43.917 --> 00:01:45.075
So in your opinion

00:01:45.616 --> 00:01:47.055
Where should we go first?

00:01:52.558 --> 00:01:54.802
Golden lock and crape myrtle

00:01:54.827 --> 00:01:56.226
They are inseparable sisters

00:01:56.735 --> 00:01:57.934
Logically speaking

00:01:58.514 --> 00:01:59.674
Where is Ziwei?

00:01:59.893 --> 00:02:01.212
Where will she be with the golden lock?

00:02:02.807 --> 00:02:04.766
Traveling all the way to Beijing to find my father

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:06.111
Take a big risk

00:02:06.754 --> 00:02:07.949
is it possible

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:09.927
I didn't take her to Beijing

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.200
He left her in his hometown in Jinan

00:02:13.728 --> 00:02:14.329
Um

00:02:14.354 --> 00:02:15.908
Ziwei, do you remember?

00:02:16.108 --> 00:02:18.146
When you first arrived at the courtyard,

00:02:18.182 --> 00:02:19.023
one person

00:02:19.048 --> 00:02:20.615
Still feeling sick

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.661
no one around

00:02:22.127 --> 00:02:23.527
If they are really good sisters

00:02:23.552 --> 00:02:25.112
I'm sure I won't leave it alone.

00:02:25.387 --> 00:02:25.788
Um

00:02:25.813 --> 00:02:26.172
Too

00:02:26.197 --> 00:02:26.655
Um

00:02:26.824 --> 00:02:27.758
Then it seems we must

00:02:27.783 --> 00:02:29.152
I went to Jinan City to see it.

00:02:29.723 --> 00:02:30.723
See if there are any clues

00:02:31.526 --> 00:02:32.233
Go! Go! Go

00:02:33.418 --> 00:02:35.697
After we left the palace

00:02:35.742 --> 00:02:37.555
It's dangerous to stay here too

00:02:37.734 --> 00:02:38.980
It's better to go to other places

00:02:39.005 --> 00:02:40.083
In this case

00:02:40.108 --> 00:02:42.490
I can find the golden lock girl again

00:02:42.515 --> 00:02:43.752
We can hang out together again

00:02:44.688 --> 00:02:45.746
You just know how to play

00:02:46.212 --> 00:02:47.690
Help Lin'er find clues first

00:02:47.715 --> 00:02:49.036
It's important to let her go home

00:02:50.065 --> 00:02:51.849
You can go and have some fun later

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:54.196
good

00:02:55.808 --> 00:02:56.968
thank you

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:58.520
I tell all your stories

00:02:58.545 --> 00:02:59.784
It's a mess

00:03:00.102 --> 00:03:01.330
You still help me like this

00:03:18.964 --> 00:03:19.743
Jingyuan

00:03:19.832 --> 00:03:20.733
I'm fine

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:23.418
I just want you to come back

00:03:23.443 --> 00:03:25.004
A place that truly belongs to you

00:03:28.191 --> 00:03:29.177
Back to Beijing

00:03:31.358 --> 00:03:32.358
Return to Chaoyang District

00:04:06.992 --> 00:04:08.186
Emperor Ama

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.140
Emperor Ama’s auspiciousness

00:04:10.374 --> 00:04:11.254
You have finished approving the memorial

00:04:11.279 --> 00:04:11.799
Um

00:04:11.824 --> 00:04:12.545
How about it

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.149
Is your waist sore or your back hurts?

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:14.796
emperor

00:04:14.821 --> 00:04:15.268
Why

00:04:15.293 --> 00:04:16.652
I made chrysanthemum tea for you

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.130
Best for clearing the liver and improving eyesight

00:04:32.248 --> 00:04:33.490
Little Swallow is the best

00:04:33.653 --> 00:04:34.324
you say

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:36.912
Little Swallow is the best

00:04:36.966 --> 00:04:37.605
you say

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:38.855
You say it

00:04:39.242 --> 00:04:40.465
Little Swallow is the best

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.318
Say it

00:04:42.842 --> 00:04:44.615
Little Swallow is the best

00:04:46.583 --> 00:04:47.727
Emperor Ama

00:04:48.298 --> 00:04:49.262
Emperor Ama’s auspiciousness

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:50.452
Sit down, sit down

00:04:51.785 --> 00:04:52.863
Got a new gadget

00:04:52.888 --> 00:04:53.412
Um

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.330
You have finished approving the memorial

00:04:55.545 --> 00:04:55.985
Um

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.890
Is the back sore?

00:04:56.915 --> 00:04:57.677
Does backache hurt?

00:04:57.975 --> 00:04:58.949
Are your eyes tired?

00:04:59.184 --> 00:05:01.083
I use my swallow fist

00:05:01.108 --> 00:05:01.908
Give you a beating

00:05:02.058 --> 00:05:02.714
good

00:05:04.474 --> 00:05:05.492
How is the strength?

00:05:06.956 --> 00:05:08.516
just right

00:05:09.598 --> 00:05:10.130
emperor

00:05:10.155 --> 00:05:10.516
Um

00:05:10.541 --> 00:05:11.740
I made chrysanthemum tea for you

00:05:11.765 --> 00:05:12.125
oh

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.549
Best for clearing the liver and improving eyesight

00:05:13.808 --> 00:05:14.430
You try it

00:05:20.211 --> 00:05:21.055
Um

00:05:21.692 --> 00:05:23.190
Miaki Kiyomi

00:05:23.481 --> 00:05:24.974
All in tea

00:05:25.258 --> 00:05:25.749
Um

00:05:25.774 --> 00:05:27.132
The emperor is busy with everything

00:05:27.157 --> 00:05:28.790
Be sure to remember to take care of your dragon body

00:05:28.815 --> 00:05:30.208
Don't overwork yourself

00:05:30.233 --> 00:05:31.083
oops

00:05:31.108 --> 00:05:32.280
You two

00:05:33.924 --> 00:05:36.124
One is my Jieyuhua

00:05:37.336 --> 00:05:39.493
One is pistachio

00:05:39.518 --> 00:05:40.718
pistachio

00:05:40.743 --> 00:05:43.462
As long as I come to Shufangzhai

00:05:43.487 --> 00:05:46.455
There are no worries anymore

00:05:47.781 --> 00:05:48.820
Come and beat me over there

00:05:52.542 --> 00:05:53.542
what's this name

00:05:53.763 --> 00:05:54.732
little liar

00:05:55.022 --> 00:05:56.101
little liar

00:05:56.143 --> 00:05:56.705
Um

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:57.848
Isn't that you?

00:05:57.873 --> 00:05:59.554
I'm not a little liar

00:06:14.952 --> 00:06:16.312
Hana Hana

00:06:16.963 --> 00:06:18.323
pistachio

00:06:19.277 --> 00:06:20.637
What they brought to me

00:06:21.776 --> 00:06:23.790
Is it really the crime of deceiving the emperor?

00:06:25.239 --> 00:06:26.880
Of course it is the crime of deceiving the emperor

00:06:28.765 --> 00:06:29.596
Queen

00:06:30.368 --> 00:06:31.458
What did you just say

00:06:32.972 --> 00:06:33.972
The emperor is kind

00:06:34.393 --> 00:06:35.846
Only then will he be deceived by the traitor

00:06:36.716 --> 00:06:38.836
Those two girls are full of lies

00:06:39.443 --> 00:06:40.443
Bad motives

00:06:40.757 --> 00:06:42.152
Just greedy for glory

00:06:42.434 --> 00:06:44.455
Have you ever had the slightest respect or love for the Emperor?

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.371
Okay, okay

00:06:46.371 --> 00:06:47.371
matter

00:06:47.483 --> 00:06:48.802
I want to go and try it myself

00:06:49.676 --> 00:06:50.955
I'm afraid it's too late

00:06:51.987 --> 00:06:52.987
two days ago

00:06:53.637 --> 00:06:56.156
They had already kidnapped Jing Yuan and escaped from the palace.

00:06:56.766 --> 00:06:57.489
What

00:06:58.616 --> 00:07:00.374
Why hasn't anyone started talking about this matter?

00:07:00.399 --> 00:07:02.320
I don’t want the emperor to be hit again

00:07:02.796 --> 00:07:04.637
People have been dispatched throughout the city to hunt him down

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:07.771
The concubine dared to remind the emperor

00:07:08.244 --> 00:07:09.724
Your favorite fifth elder brother

00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:11.148
The promising Falcon

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.246
He actually kidnapped my concubine’s adopted son

00:07:13.359 --> 00:07:14.637
With an unidentified princess

00:07:14.662 --> 00:07:15.662
Escaped from the palace

00:07:15.934 --> 00:07:17.532
Such rebellious behavior

00:07:17.557 --> 00:07:18.183
emperor

00:07:20.858 --> 00:07:21.858
implore the emperor

00:07:21.991 --> 00:07:24.430
Don't be fooled by their sweet words anymore

00:07:24.699 --> 00:07:25.699
How unreasonable

00:07:27.438 --> 00:07:28.637
This is an act of rebellion

00:07:28.662 --> 00:07:29.627
Rebellion against Tiangang

00:07:33.267 --> 00:07:34.190
In vain

00:07:34.855 --> 00:07:36.587
Still thinking about old feelings

00:07:37.785 --> 00:07:38.540
good

00:07:40.039 --> 00:07:42.012
Since they want to put the law to the test

00:07:42.037 --> 00:07:42.621
That me

00:07:43.301 --> 00:07:44.741
Just let them have a taste

00:07:45.389 --> 00:07:47.289
What it feels like to be wanted

00:08:01.892 --> 00:08:03.333
If they are found

00:08:03.868 --> 00:08:05.902
If I carry out lynching, it will be exposed.

00:08:07.886 --> 00:08:09.424
Don't stop doing one thing and two things

00:08:10.743 --> 00:08:12.440
More experts are sent to search the city

00:08:12.523 --> 00:08:13.415
Once discovered

00:08:14.013 --> 00:08:15.333
Just in the name of resisting arrest

00:08:15.462 --> 00:08:16.368
correct employment law

00:08:16.954 --> 00:08:17.793
empress

00:08:18.058 --> 00:08:19.345
Lord Jing, he

00:08:22.064 --> 00:08:24.049
He knows everyone under me

00:08:25.482 --> 00:08:27.143
If he is still stubborn

00:08:29.324 --> 00:08:31.899
Just think that I have raised him for nothing

00:08:38.103 --> 00:08:39.143
Have you seen this person?

00:08:39.939 --> 00:08:40.668
Come down and walk

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:42.993
Let me see

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:44.783
etc.

00:08:45.111 --> 00:08:45.936
What's going on over there?

00:08:45.961 --> 00:08:47.087
Let's go

00:08:48.648 --> 00:08:49.533
Come here first

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:52.940
What is this?

00:08:55.802 --> 00:08:56.496
Go over there

00:09:05.575 --> 00:09:08.055
Isn't it me who's in the portrait?

00:09:08.883 --> 00:09:10.124
And me

00:09:14.343 --> 00:09:15.741
Now even the fifth elder brother and Erkang

00:09:15.766 --> 00:09:16.607
All are wanted

00:09:16.632 --> 00:09:18.511
Huang Ama really doesn’t leave us a way to survive.

00:09:18.746 --> 00:09:19.746
It is not advisable to stay here for a long time

00:09:20.046 --> 00:09:21.206
We have to find a way out of town

00:09:21.936 --> 00:09:22.296
Um

00:09:22.321 --> 00:09:22.940
Why

00:09:22.965 --> 00:09:23.549
it's them

00:09:23.574 --> 00:09:24.087
Too bad

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.239
Go, go, go

00:09:25.264 --> 00:09:25.815
Walk

00:09:25.995 --> 00:09:26.715
stop

00:09:27.179 --> 00:09:27.977
Don't run

00:09:29.514 --> 00:09:30.274
Don't run

00:09:44.074 --> 00:09:44.777
Erkang

00:09:45.705 --> 00:09:46.318
crape myrtle

00:09:47.324 --> 00:09:48.287
Erkang

00:09:48.861 --> 00:09:49.342
crape myrtle

00:09:49.383 --> 00:09:50.383
Erkang

00:09:52.961 --> 00:09:53.633
crape myrtle

00:09:57.358 --> 00:09:58.071
This way

00:09:58.096 --> 00:09:58.749
stop

00:09:59.493 --> 00:10:00.162
stop

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:11.757
Search and come here

00:10:14.195 --> 00:10:14.899
Let's go

00:10:17.803 --> 00:10:18.437
Gone

00:10:27.138 --> 00:10:27.946
Walk

00:10:30.223 --> 00:10:30.715
crape myrtle

00:10:30.857 --> 00:10:31.474
Jingyuan

00:10:32.037 --> 00:10:32.999
Lin'er

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:36.172
I found wanted posters along the way

00:10:36.197 --> 00:10:37.487
There is no Jingyuan in the portrait

00:10:37.512 --> 00:10:38.330
Not as good as this

00:10:38.355 --> 00:10:39.202
Jing Yuan and I

00:10:39.648 --> 00:10:41.465
We went together to Jinan to look for golden locks

00:10:41.747 --> 00:10:43.408
You go back to the courtyard first to avoid the limelight.

00:10:43.833 --> 00:10:45.033
This reduces the risk

00:10:45.058 --> 00:10:46.118
Jinan

00:10:46.365 --> 00:10:46.838
Can

00:10:46.863 --> 00:10:47.790
But Jinan is so big

00:10:47.815 --> 00:10:49.087
How did you find the golden lock?

00:10:50.301 --> 00:10:51.290
That's not a big problem

00:10:51.365 --> 00:10:53.605
The Criminal Investigation Department has a lot of experience in investigating cases and searching for people.

00:10:53.696 --> 00:10:54.243
OK

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:55.769
I think this plan is feasible

00:10:56.056 --> 00:10:57.617
Our top priority now is to save lives

00:10:57.842 --> 00:10:59.058
Little Swallow and Willow Green and Willow Red

00:10:59.083 --> 00:10:59.803
They are all old Jianghu

00:10:59.993 --> 00:11:01.349
They can help us hide

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:02.287
crape myrtle

00:11:02.695 --> 00:11:04.387
Since Lin'er said we are the protagonist group

00:11:04.413 --> 00:11:05.590
So only we are safe

00:11:05.615 --> 00:11:06.935
Only then can she have no worries

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.274
Go all out to find the golden lock

00:11:08.553 --> 00:11:09.330
Um

00:11:11.624 --> 00:11:12.271
good

00:11:12.296 --> 00:11:12.975
Lin'er

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:13.760
Then you and Jing Yuan

00:11:13.785 --> 00:11:15.863
We must go to Jinan safely and find the Golden Lock

00:11:16.075 --> 00:11:17.137
I'll wait for you to come back

00:11:17.302 --> 00:11:17.949
Take care of yourself

00:11:21.201 --> 00:11:21.721
Take care of yourself

00:11:21.797 --> 00:11:22.308
good

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:23.712
every year

00:11:24.421 --> 00:11:25.421
Without further ado

00:11:25.839 --> 00:11:26.400
good

00:11:26.669 --> 00:11:27.149
Walk

00:11:27.708 --> 00:11:28.427
Walk

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:31.164
stop

00:11:32.359 --> 00:11:32.890
come over

00:11:33.548 --> 00:11:34.837
Although we are not wanted

00:11:35.134 --> 00:11:36.777
But there is no way out of the city

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:51.808
stop

00:11:54.247 --> 00:11:54.980
parking

00:11:58.896 --> 00:12:00.176
The people in the car came down to check

00:12:05.938 --> 00:12:07.619
Officer, this is my daughter

00:12:23.224 --> 00:12:23.982
Let's go

00:12:24.007 --> 00:12:24.647
The city gate is about to close

00:12:24.672 --> 00:12:25.883
Yes yes yes yes

00:12:25.931 --> 00:12:26.687
release

00:12:45.623 --> 00:12:46.743
Everyone should have a rest early.

00:12:46.951 --> 00:12:48.502
I have to leave early tomorrow

00:12:50.446 --> 00:12:51.587
Already out of town

00:12:51.728 --> 00:12:52.769
You two, come down

00:13:01.738 --> 00:13:03.162
Who are you?

00:13:03.187 --> 00:13:03.786
not me

00:13:03.822 --> 00:13:04.318
father

00:13:04.343 --> 00:13:05.901
they are my friends

00:13:06.697 --> 00:13:07.655
Uncle us

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.679
I am a maid from a wealthy family

00:13:10.509 --> 00:13:13.869
We are in love with our young master

00:13:14.821 --> 00:13:16.581
But my mistress wouldn’t let me

00:13:17.024 --> 00:13:18.185
So Master

00:13:19.181 --> 00:13:22.074
Then take me away from the capital

00:13:22.838 --> 00:13:24.318
Return to hometown in Jinan

00:13:25.153 --> 00:13:27.293
Why don’t you have a Jinan accent?

00:13:28.012 --> 00:13:28.537
oh

00:13:28.562 --> 00:13:29.640
when she was five

00:13:29.665 --> 00:13:31.025
So he was sold to our house by Yapo.

00:13:31.642 --> 00:13:32.283
Um

00:13:33.009 --> 00:13:33.865
What

00:13:34.554 --> 00:13:35.353
father

00:13:35.378 --> 00:13:37.099
We happened to pass by Jinan

00:13:37.124 --> 00:13:38.790
Just help them.

00:13:38.989 --> 00:13:39.840
What help?

00:13:42.258 --> 00:13:42.983
benefactor

00:13:44.416 --> 00:13:45.483
Please make it easier for you

00:13:45.782 --> 00:13:46.461
help us

00:13:46.486 --> 00:13:47.137
Um

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:49.746
That’s all

00:13:50.126 --> 00:13:51.927
Would rather demolish ten temples

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:53.789
Never ruin a family relationship

00:13:54.233 --> 00:13:55.805
Let's hit the road together tomorrow

00:13:56.008 --> 00:13:56.727
thank you

00:13:56.863 --> 00:13:57.540
thank you

00:13:57.565 --> 00:13:58.402
go to bed early

00:14:02.662 --> 00:14:03.383
thank you

00:14:03.408 --> 00:14:04.408
saved us

00:14:04.569 --> 00:14:05.299
Little benefactor

00:14:05.372 --> 00:14:06.372
May I have your name

00:14:06.529 --> 00:14:07.805
My name is Xiaohongzao

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:09.469
Do you like eating red dates?

00:14:09.494 --> 00:14:10.734
So is it called Little Red Date?

00:14:10.972 --> 00:14:11.740
Um

00:14:12.628 --> 00:14:14.440
Give me all your osmanthus candies

00:14:14.465 --> 00:14:15.917
I’ll give you my red dates to eat

00:14:15.942 --> 00:14:17.302
Thank you very much

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:26.860
Are you optimistic?

00:14:30.006 --> 00:14:31.006
That's how it works

00:14:31.403 --> 00:14:32.037
You try

00:14:35.694 --> 00:14:36.694
I'm chasing you

00:14:41.164 --> 00:14:43.408
We'll reach Jinan in three days' walk.

00:14:45.462 --> 00:14:47.109
Thank you so much for your care along the way.

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:49.118
You're welcome

00:14:49.143 --> 00:14:51.452
You guys took care of little red dates for me all the way

00:14:51.955 --> 00:14:53.314
Her mother left early

00:14:53.339 --> 00:14:56.374
I took her everywhere to beg for food.

00:14:56.823 --> 00:14:58.823
She can't even make any friends

00:14:58.848 --> 00:14:59.633
Look

00:15:00.015 --> 00:15:02.212
She hasn't been this happy for a long time

00:15:03.485 --> 00:15:04.368
small red dates

00:15:06.528 --> 00:15:07.155
father

00:15:07.651 --> 00:15:09.199
Let sister take a rest

00:15:09.323 --> 00:15:11.527
I'll take you to the street to buy delicious food

00:15:12.378 --> 00:15:12.971
elder sister

00:15:12.996 --> 00:15:14.315
I'll bring you something delicious when I come back

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:14.930
good

00:15:15.325 --> 00:15:16.230
Slow down

00:15:16.493 --> 00:15:17.471
Walk

00:15:21.949 --> 00:15:22.965
Don't get too involved

00:15:24.574 --> 00:15:25.243
you forgot

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.068
We are all characters in your storybook

00:15:27.816 --> 00:15:29.336
You really treat Xiaohongzao as your friend

00:15:30.621 --> 00:15:31.861
Little Yanzi said

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:34.130
As long as this feeling is real

00:15:34.639 --> 00:15:36.490
Then this world is real

00:15:37.179 --> 00:15:38.896
Xiao Hongzao is my friend

00:15:48.908 --> 00:15:49.671
Is it sweet?

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:50.368
Um

00:15:50.528 --> 00:15:51.040
sweet

00:15:51.507 --> 00:15:52.412
Jingyuan

00:15:53.438 --> 00:15:55.490
I believe this is the real world

00:16:02.473 --> 00:16:03.262
so sweet
