DEAR X

00:00:53.845 --> 00:00:55.889
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND EVENTS
IN THIS WORK ARE FICTITIOUS

00:00:55.972 --> 00:00:57.515
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
WITH GUARDIANS PRESENT

00:02:08.878 --> 00:02:10.130
Two, three. Clear!

00:02:19.055 --> 00:02:21.724
CARDIAC PACEMAKER

00:02:48.751 --> 00:02:50.253
- One, two, three. Clear!
- At that fork

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:53.631
where one life stands
between life and death

00:02:55.758 --> 00:02:57.886
what kind of prayer
did desperate Ah-jin

00:02:59.554 --> 00:03:01.055
offer up?

00:03:03.558 --> 00:03:05.018
At death's door

00:03:06.394 --> 00:03:08.021
was that one's life

00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:10.607
or one's end?

00:03:23.286 --> 00:03:24.287
Was that death

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.499
God's answer to Ah-jin's prayer

00:03:30.293 --> 00:03:31.294
or His punishment?

00:03:46.434 --> 00:03:47.435
WITH DEEPEST CONDOLENCES

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.161
No!

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.588
Grandma!

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:29.620
EPISODE 8: BEFORE JUDGMENT

00:05:32.415 --> 00:05:34.959
SAMYUN SEOUL HOSPITAL MEMORIAL HALL

00:05:35.043 --> 00:05:37.462
NOTICE REGARDING MEDIA COVERAGE

00:06:31.182 --> 00:06:33.559
REST IN PEACE

00:06:37.772 --> 00:06:38.898
Get some rest.

00:06:38.981 --> 00:06:40.483
You'll collapse at this rate.

00:06:40.566 --> 00:06:42.318
I'll take him outside for a moment.

00:06:45.571 --> 00:06:47.365
HONG KYUNG-SUK

00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:56.874
- You two know each other?
- Yes.

00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.709
He helped me out a lot.

00:06:58.793 --> 00:07:01.587
And I worked part-time
at his café for a year.

00:07:05.675 --> 00:07:09.804
BASEBALL PLAYER CHOI ARRESTED
FOR MURDERING A PART-TIMER'S FATHER

00:07:09.887 --> 00:07:12.140
PARTIALLY ADMITTED GUILT
AND SAID "IT WAS IMPULSIVE"

00:07:24.694 --> 00:07:26.821
I was going to go home

00:07:28.156 --> 00:07:29.490
after In-gang left.

00:07:31.242 --> 00:07:32.910
But I went to her place instead.

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:37.081
He had asked me

00:07:38.833 --> 00:07:43.796
and I remembered she hasn't been
sleeping well at night lately.

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:48.551
I wanted to keep her company.

00:07:48.634 --> 00:07:51.804
I thought of you
as a gift from my daughter.

00:07:53.723 --> 00:07:57.310
I scolded In-gang for doubting you
and pushing you away.

00:07:58.811 --> 00:08:00.521
I reprimanded him for that.

00:08:01.439 --> 00:08:04.775
You looked so pitiful
when I first saw you

00:08:04.859 --> 00:08:07.111
so I believed
you could never do such a thing.

00:08:07.862 --> 00:08:08.863
The one who deceived me...

00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:10.490
No.

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:12.950
The one who deceived my whole family!

00:08:14.118 --> 00:08:15.912
I foolishly trusted you

00:08:16.662 --> 00:08:19.624
and I drove my own grandson...

00:08:21.667 --> 00:08:23.628
into a bottomless pit.

00:08:29.967 --> 00:08:30.968
What...

00:08:31.886 --> 00:08:33.346
What should I do?

00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:37.558
What am I supposed to do now, Ah-jin?

00:08:39.852 --> 00:08:42.980
Can you explain what happened

00:08:43.064 --> 00:08:45.566
before and after the fall?

00:08:50.446 --> 00:08:51.656
A cat.

00:08:54.033 --> 00:08:55.993
She went out to show me

00:08:57.495 --> 00:09:00.498
the kitten that had come by.

00:09:01.999 --> 00:09:03.000
A cat?

00:09:05.378 --> 00:09:06.587
She used to feed

00:09:07.922 --> 00:09:10.925
the stray cats in the neighborhood.

00:09:11.175 --> 00:09:15.263
In-mo is allergic,
so she couldn't let them inside.

00:09:18.015 --> 00:09:21.060
She had only put food out for them.

00:09:22.353 --> 00:09:26.357
Sometimes, the cats would bring
their kittens

00:09:26.983 --> 00:09:28.234
and show up at her door

00:09:29.485 --> 00:09:31.362
at night.

00:09:32.071 --> 00:09:33.072
Please continue.

00:09:34.532 --> 00:09:36.617
After putting food out for them...

00:09:38.953 --> 00:09:40.288
she was standing up...

00:09:42.498 --> 00:09:46.335
when she suddenly swayed
as if she got dizzy.

00:09:56.929 --> 00:09:58.472
Then, she lost consciousness.

00:10:05.438 --> 00:10:06.439
I see.

00:10:07.356 --> 00:10:09.150
I know this is hard

00:10:10.568 --> 00:10:12.236
but I have a few more questions.

00:10:31.714 --> 00:10:32.798
I'll take care of it.

00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:35.843
I'll wipe every security camera
and dash cam clean

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:38.679
so get her away from here.

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:41.182
It's more natural
to say that I was here.

00:10:43.184 --> 00:10:44.894
And there aren't
any security cameras here.

00:10:46.562 --> 00:10:47.813
Don't do anything stupid.

00:11:02.578 --> 00:11:05.331
A grandma fell down the stairs.

00:11:07.625 --> 00:11:08.751
Please hurry.

00:11:19.804 --> 00:11:20.805
Wait!

00:11:24.058 --> 00:11:26.519
I'd like to know
exactly what kind of relationship

00:11:26.936 --> 00:11:28.229
you have with Baek Ah-jin.

00:11:28.604 --> 00:11:29.772
I looked you up.

00:11:30.147 --> 00:11:32.024
The Nojeong-dong Rooftop Murder Case.

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:35.528
What does that have to do
with Dharma Sister Yeonhwa's passing?

00:11:35.611 --> 00:11:37.363
I read that you testified
you were caught in a trap

00:11:37.446 --> 00:11:39.949
set by the victim's daughter,
who worked part-time at your café.

00:11:40.032 --> 00:11:42.034
What exactly are you trying to ask?

00:11:42.952 --> 00:11:45.621
Is it whether there's a link

00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:47.790
between Baek Ah-jin
and her father's murder?

00:11:47.873 --> 00:11:49.166
Can you answer that?

00:11:49.917 --> 00:11:51.210
You want an answer?

00:11:55.881 --> 00:11:57.967
Between the murder
of Mr. Baek Seon-gyu...

00:12:00.094 --> 00:12:01.804
and Ms. Baek Ah-jin...

00:12:05.975 --> 00:12:06.976
there is no connection.

00:12:07.852 --> 00:12:08.853
Sorry?

00:12:08.936 --> 00:12:10.479
No connection whatsoever.

00:12:11.313 --> 00:12:14.024
Back then, I testified like that
out of a cowardly wish

00:12:14.108 --> 00:12:16.861
to slip through the law
because I was afraid

00:12:16.944 --> 00:12:18.362
of becoming a criminal.

00:12:19.405 --> 00:12:20.906
Which I regret now.

00:12:22.199 --> 00:12:26.078
I served five years
and paid for my crime behind bars

00:12:26.871 --> 00:12:28.372
but my debt to the deceased

00:12:29.623 --> 00:12:31.584
is something I must carry for life.

00:12:34.211 --> 00:12:35.296
Baek Ah-jin is

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:38.966
simply a bereaved daughter
who lost her family.

00:12:39.049 --> 00:12:40.259
She's someone

00:12:41.093 --> 00:12:42.887
I must keep apologizing to
until the day I die.

00:12:43.512 --> 00:12:45.723
Since she became so famous

00:12:46.515 --> 00:12:49.935
there will inevitably be
all kinds of rumors.

00:12:50.019 --> 00:12:51.937
But they're baseless.

00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:53.606
I'm relieved to hear that.

00:12:54.398 --> 00:12:55.858
Thank you for coming.

00:13:05.618 --> 00:13:07.369
Why did you tell him that?

00:13:14.835 --> 00:13:16.212
It was a chance to get revenge.

00:13:19.757 --> 00:13:21.050
Why defend me?

00:13:27.807 --> 00:13:29.350
During my first year in prison...

00:13:31.894 --> 00:13:33.604
I wondered what I'd do to you

00:13:35.105 --> 00:13:36.565
once I got out...

00:13:38.734 --> 00:13:39.985
and how to pay you back.

00:13:42.321 --> 00:13:43.447
During the second year

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:46.367
I kept thinking...

00:13:48.828 --> 00:13:50.037
"Why me, of all people?"

00:13:52.748 --> 00:13:54.625
After the third winter...

00:13:57.253 --> 00:13:59.755
I started thinking
about what could have driven you...

00:14:02.383 --> 00:14:04.051
to do something so horrific.

00:14:06.178 --> 00:14:07.513
And the year after that...

00:14:10.516 --> 00:14:12.518
I began taking pity on you.

00:14:15.479 --> 00:14:18.649
If you had had
even one proper adult in your life

00:14:20.192 --> 00:14:21.861
as a child

00:14:22.444 --> 00:14:26.740
I thought your path
might have been different.

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:29.910
So, in the last year

00:14:32.079 --> 00:14:33.414
I decided to pray for you.

00:14:35.624 --> 00:14:37.042
And I started wondering

00:14:37.918 --> 00:14:41.797
if I could become
that one adult for you.

00:14:45.342 --> 00:14:46.969
Once I thought about it that way

00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:50.556
I stopped resenting you.

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:54.643
So, don't carry any guilt.

00:14:56.604 --> 00:14:57.646
What happened then

00:14:59.106 --> 00:15:00.649
was simply my fate.

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:04.361
That sounds just like you.

00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:07.156
I'm going to root for you.

00:15:07.698 --> 00:15:08.824
That's my way.

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:15.831
So, live your life
remembering there's someone out there

00:15:16.498 --> 00:15:19.335
who genuinely pities you

00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:22.880
and sincerely cheers for you.

00:15:25.507 --> 00:15:26.800
Try living like that.

00:15:30.679 --> 00:15:32.598
That's the best revenge I can offer.

00:15:38.771 --> 00:15:41.106
But Mr. Choi.

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:48.322
There's no such thing
as "best revenge."

00:15:50.115 --> 00:15:51.617
What just happened was

00:15:52.576 --> 00:15:54.578
that you missed
your one and only chance

00:15:55.621 --> 00:15:57.623
to take revenge on me.

00:16:03.045 --> 00:16:04.046
Thank you.

00:16:14.098 --> 00:16:15.641
HEO IN-GANG WAS KNOWN
TO BE DEEPLY AFFECTIONATE

00:16:15.724 --> 00:16:17.101
TOWARD HIS GRANDMOTHER...

00:16:17.184 --> 00:16:18.894
Baek Ah-jin and Heo In-gang?

00:16:19.353 --> 00:16:21.480
How long are you going to milk them?

00:16:21.563 --> 00:16:22.898
It works for the public.

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.775
They're like a bone broth.

00:16:24.858 --> 00:16:27.277
You boil and boil,
and it still gives.

00:16:27.361 --> 00:16:30.239
It's about time
they broke up, though.

00:16:30.781 --> 00:16:33.075
I was going to lock in the breakup
as an exclusive

00:16:33.158 --> 00:16:34.660
and be done with it.

00:16:34.743 --> 00:16:36.829
Why split up a couple
that's doing fine?

00:16:36.912 --> 00:16:38.622
Isn't it obvious?

00:16:39.039 --> 00:16:41.542
Ah-jin is a rising sun,
and In-gang is a setting sun.

00:16:42.084 --> 00:16:45.754
She's gotten everything
she could out of him.

00:16:45.838 --> 00:16:48.424
Why would she keep dating him?

00:16:48.507 --> 00:16:50.300
Who knows?

00:16:50.384 --> 00:16:51.552
It could be true love.

00:16:54.847 --> 00:16:57.933
"True love"? You don't know anything.

00:17:26.211 --> 00:17:27.671
What do you want?

00:17:27.755 --> 00:17:29.006
Oh, nothing.

00:17:29.089 --> 00:17:32.801
I'm just calling to see
if there's anything new.

00:17:32.885 --> 00:17:36.597
Nothing pulls clicks
like you and In-gang.

00:17:37.056 --> 00:17:39.391
We're in mourning. Show some respect.

00:17:39.475 --> 00:17:41.143
I have something to verify--

00:17:41.226 --> 00:17:42.227
Hello?

00:17:42.644 --> 00:17:43.645
Hello...

00:17:46.023 --> 00:17:47.483
Right.

00:17:48.358 --> 00:17:50.277
For a time like this...

00:17:52.071 --> 00:17:53.072
RÉSUMÉ

00:17:53.155 --> 00:17:54.364
PHOTO

00:17:55.324 --> 00:17:57.159
Hello, Ms. Sim Sung-hee?

00:17:57.576 --> 00:17:59.286
I told you I never did that.

00:17:59.369 --> 00:18:01.914
It looks like Ah-jin's side
has already made a move.

00:18:01.997 --> 00:18:03.665
Was it Longstar's CEO, Seo Mi-ri?

00:18:04.124 --> 00:18:05.667
I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:18:06.877 --> 00:18:09.171
If you're going to keep talking
nonsense, I'm hanging up.

00:18:17.054 --> 00:18:18.680
I did what you told me to.

00:18:19.348 --> 00:18:20.599
Guess you're scared, after all.

00:18:24.269 --> 00:18:25.270
Figures.

00:18:25.646 --> 00:18:28.398
Your dad's past
as an adulterous lawyer

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:31.151
and your own past,
stealing your classmates' stuff

00:18:31.235 --> 00:18:33.028
beaten by the homeroom teacher
and kids

00:18:33.112 --> 00:18:34.655
and forced to transfer.

00:18:35.906 --> 00:18:38.200
It'll look bad on you
if those spread in your workplace.

00:18:41.036 --> 00:18:43.539
You saw the comments
on your post last time, right?

00:18:44.832 --> 00:18:46.667
Plenty of people still remember you.

00:18:47.459 --> 00:18:50.003
So, unless you want
your past dragged out in the open

00:18:50.087 --> 00:18:51.588
shut your mouth and lie low.

00:18:55.134 --> 00:18:56.135
If not

00:18:57.427 --> 00:18:59.972
I'll follow you around
with your past everywhere you go.

00:19:11.483 --> 00:19:12.484
Fuck.

00:19:12.568 --> 00:19:15.863
SAMYUN SEOUL HOSPITAL MEMORIAL HALL

00:19:18.907 --> 00:19:19.908
Director.

00:19:22.077 --> 00:19:23.078
Hello.

00:19:25.247 --> 00:19:26.665
Are you heading out now?

00:19:27.082 --> 00:19:28.667
Oh, Ms. Baek Ah-jin.

00:19:29.793 --> 00:19:31.503
I'm glad you know my name.

00:19:31.587 --> 00:19:33.338
I was nervous you might not.

00:19:33.589 --> 00:19:36.091
Of course, I do.
I enjoyed your works.

00:19:36.633 --> 00:19:37.634
Thank you.

00:19:38.552 --> 00:19:40.804
I've watched all of yours as well.

00:19:41.054 --> 00:19:42.681
I'm a big fan.

00:19:42.764 --> 00:19:44.892
And In-gang talks about you so much.

00:19:44.975 --> 00:19:48.353
He does?
I should buy him a meal sometime.

00:19:48.437 --> 00:19:49.438
No need.

00:19:49.938 --> 00:19:51.815
Since you came today

00:19:51.899 --> 00:19:57.654
once he settles down,
let me treat you to a meal with him.

00:19:59.072 --> 00:20:00.282
What do you say?

00:20:00.532 --> 00:20:02.409
I'd love that. Anytime.

00:20:03.118 --> 00:20:04.953
For today, please stay by him

00:20:05.537 --> 00:20:06.955
and comfort him.

00:20:07.789 --> 00:20:08.790
I will.

00:20:10.667 --> 00:20:12.753
- Get home safe.
- Thanks.

00:20:16.423 --> 00:20:17.507
Ms. Baek.

00:20:19.343 --> 00:20:21.053
If you don't mind

00:20:21.136 --> 00:20:23.639
how about you drop
by my studio sometime?

00:20:27.726 --> 00:20:30.604
He must have seen Ah-jin
at In-gang's grandma's funeral.

00:20:30.854 --> 00:20:32.606
He said she was the image
he'd been looking for

00:20:32.689 --> 00:20:36.985
and wants her to play
a key role in his new work.

00:20:37.486 --> 00:20:39.279
Director Seol Yeong-uk is...

00:20:39.363 --> 00:20:41.156
It'll be invited
to the Cannes Film Festival

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.784
and that naturally opens
a route into the global market.

00:20:43.867 --> 00:20:46.161
There's no better opportunity
for an actor.

00:20:46.245 --> 00:20:48.413
It's what every actor dreams of.

00:20:51.583 --> 00:20:55.045
In-gang's grandma left Ah-jin
a big gift as she passed.

00:21:13.981 --> 00:21:15.399
You're curious, aren't you?

00:21:16.275 --> 00:21:19.403
Whether I was the one
who did it to her that night.

00:21:27.119 --> 00:21:28.495
What do you think?

00:21:30.038 --> 00:21:32.040
Do you think I could go that far?

00:21:37.004 --> 00:21:38.171
I don't get you.

00:21:42.509 --> 00:21:44.094
It must have been hard

00:21:44.344 --> 00:21:46.888
thinking about what to do with a girl
who even committed a murder.

00:21:48.223 --> 00:21:49.224
Say it.

00:21:51.727 --> 00:21:53.145
It wasn't you, right?

00:21:53.228 --> 00:21:55.689
And what happens if it were me?

00:22:01.361 --> 00:22:02.446
You're right.

00:22:04.114 --> 00:22:05.782
She started getting on my nerves.

00:22:06.783 --> 00:22:08.660
She was no use to me anymore

00:22:09.369 --> 00:22:11.079
and constantly got in my way.

00:22:12.998 --> 00:22:15.792
She had also found out
that I approached her on purpose.

00:22:19.796 --> 00:22:23.425
So, what do you think I did to her?

00:22:25.052 --> 00:22:26.053
Is that true?

00:22:26.511 --> 00:22:27.804
Did you really do it?

00:22:29.264 --> 00:22:30.974
Whatever you're thinking
is the truth.

00:22:31.058 --> 00:22:32.059
Baek Ah-jin.

00:22:38.565 --> 00:22:40.108
This is so exhausting.

00:23:33.578 --> 00:23:35.414
Excuse me.

00:23:35.831 --> 00:23:38.583
You're the grandson of the lady
who lived in Unit 401, right?

00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:44.005
My grandma was crying?

00:23:44.589 --> 00:23:48.093
Yes, she was practically wailing,
so I was shocked.

00:23:48.176 --> 00:23:49.636
She normally doesn't do that.

00:23:50.137 --> 00:23:52.097
By the time she calmed down

00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:54.933
a pretty, young woman
walked into her place.

00:23:55.225 --> 00:23:58.311
I brought her some red bean porridge

00:23:58.562 --> 00:24:00.689
and saw something strange
at the door.

00:24:01.982 --> 00:24:03.066
What was it?

00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:06.570
Your grandma was pounding
the young woman's chest

00:24:06.987 --> 00:24:11.199
saying things like, "I trusted you
who deceived my whole family."

00:24:11.283 --> 00:24:13.368
It was something like that.

00:24:15.912 --> 00:24:19.374
Also, the woman in Unit 409 said

00:24:19.458 --> 00:24:21.334
someone kept stealing her packages

00:24:21.418 --> 00:24:24.296
so she secretly set up
a camera in the hallway.

00:24:25.255 --> 00:24:27.799
But it's illegal

00:24:27.883 --> 00:24:30.177
so she probably didn't tell
the police.

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:32.596
But if your grandma fell
down the stairs

00:24:32.679 --> 00:24:34.389
between the fourth and third floors

00:24:34.473 --> 00:24:36.516
it might have been filmed.

00:24:38.977 --> 00:24:42.022
Could I speak with her?

00:24:42.731 --> 00:24:45.775
My husband saved
a copy of the footage just in case

00:24:45.859 --> 00:24:47.527
but a detective came and got it.

00:24:48.069 --> 00:24:49.696
I see.

00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:51.573
Thank you.

00:25:10.133 --> 00:25:11.760
Don't ever make me do
stuff like this again.

00:25:12.427 --> 00:25:15.096
You, of all people,
should believe in Ah-jin, damn it.

00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:18.767
- Did you see it?
- No.

00:25:19.392 --> 00:25:20.435
I don't need to.

00:25:20.894 --> 00:25:22.437
I believe her. She's innocent.

00:25:32.364 --> 00:25:33.782
And don't worry about Sung-hee.

00:25:34.366 --> 00:25:36.826
I gave her a good scare, so she won't
dare open her mouth again.

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:38.453
She won't be spreading stories
about Ah-jin.

00:25:39.287 --> 00:25:40.288
Good.

00:26:08.483 --> 00:26:10.819
In-gang, are you still in bed?

00:26:10.902 --> 00:26:12.153
Yes, why?

00:26:12.612 --> 00:26:14.531
Come on. You too?

00:26:15.532 --> 00:26:17.784
I heard you backed out of the film
you were supposed to do.

00:26:18.618 --> 00:26:20.912
We've got to hang in there
now more than ever.

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.039
Don't keep starving yourself.

00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:25.250
Remember to eat.

00:26:26.459 --> 00:26:28.295
Ah-jin brought me some porridge.

00:26:29.462 --> 00:26:30.589
I'll have it later.

00:26:49.274 --> 00:26:51.818
I saw you were asleep, so I left.

00:26:51.901 --> 00:26:53.778
Don't skip meals, okay?

00:26:54.487 --> 00:26:55.530
I love you.

00:26:59.868 --> 00:27:01.202
HEO IN-GANG SPOTTED
SHOPPING FOR RINGS IN HONG KONG

00:27:02.078 --> 00:27:05.165
There are headlines saying
you're about to get married now.

00:27:05.248 --> 00:27:07.042
This is a problem, Ms. Baek.

00:27:07.292 --> 00:27:09.002
You do know

00:27:09.085 --> 00:27:11.338
what kind of character
you're playing, right?

00:27:11.421 --> 00:27:14.424
If audiences can't stay
immersed in my film

00:27:14.507 --> 00:27:17.802
because of your real-life romance
or marriage rumors

00:27:17.886 --> 00:27:20.096
I've got no reason to cast you, do I?

00:27:21.556 --> 00:27:22.557
I'm sorry.

00:27:23.266 --> 00:27:25.894
I wasn't expecting
this kind of speculation, either.

00:27:29.898 --> 00:27:33.485
I actually like
seeing you and In-gang together.

00:27:33.568 --> 00:27:37.739
I got to work with you thanks to him,
and I appreciate that.

00:27:37.822 --> 00:27:40.575
But let's keep personal
and professional matters separate.

00:27:40.659 --> 00:27:42.619
You're not dumb enough
to confuse them

00:27:43.453 --> 00:27:44.454
right?

00:27:45.622 --> 00:27:46.623
No, Director.

00:27:48.208 --> 00:27:50.043
Director, you're already here!

00:27:50.126 --> 00:27:51.586
I came as early as I could.

00:27:52.587 --> 00:27:54.339
Long time no see, Ms. Seo.

00:27:54.631 --> 00:27:55.632
Hi.

00:27:57.592 --> 00:28:00.345
I don't see Mr. Yoon, though.
Is he running late?

00:28:01.179 --> 00:28:04.349
He said
we should meet on a better day.

00:28:05.058 --> 00:28:07.560
He said today wasn't
the night for drinking.

00:28:08.687 --> 00:28:12.607
Anyway, I'll get going.
Let's talk again soon.

00:28:13.358 --> 00:28:14.484
Of course.

00:28:14.859 --> 00:28:16.069
We'll see you soon.

00:28:16.569 --> 00:28:17.779
Take care!

00:28:24.828 --> 00:28:27.038
It must have been tough
cleaning up the mess.

00:28:28.123 --> 00:28:30.834
I only posted a statement asking
to refrain from wild speculations.

00:28:31.459 --> 00:28:32.502
What about In-gang?

00:28:33.586 --> 00:28:35.922
When has he ever cared
about articles?

00:28:36.381 --> 00:28:38.925
His fans are already freaking out
that he can't get married yet.

00:28:39.592 --> 00:28:41.469
But he's talking about retiring
once his contract's over.

00:28:41.553 --> 00:28:42.971
It's driving me insane.

00:28:46.015 --> 00:28:47.934
He really said that?

00:28:49.728 --> 00:28:51.146
He didn't tell you?

00:28:51.646 --> 00:28:53.606
I had my phone turned off.

00:28:54.566 --> 00:28:56.818
It was getting too chaotic
due to all the calls coming in.

00:29:00.822 --> 00:29:03.533
You didn't know
about the ring, either, did you?

00:29:05.118 --> 00:29:06.119
No.

00:29:07.996 --> 00:29:10.039
Are you going to marry him?

00:29:15.295 --> 00:29:17.297
No, I'm going to end it.

00:29:18.506 --> 00:29:19.883
You'll back me up, right?

00:29:22.343 --> 00:29:23.344
Ah-jin.

00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:25.638
While preparing for your birthday

00:29:26.806 --> 00:29:28.808
I realized

00:29:28.892 --> 00:29:31.227
it was the first time in my life
I had ever felt so deeply grateful

00:29:31.895 --> 00:29:33.021
that someone was born.

00:29:34.189 --> 00:29:39.277
I suddenly understood how huge
my feelings for you had become.

00:29:40.695 --> 00:29:41.946
This must be love.

00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:45.700
Let's share our lives together.

00:29:47.243 --> 00:29:49.996
Let's fill and exchange our love

00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:52.040
within the same everyday life.

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:54.793
I want to marry you.

00:29:56.377 --> 00:29:57.504
You're home, right?

00:30:09.891 --> 00:30:12.185
I'll be at your place in ten minutes.

00:30:12.727 --> 00:30:13.728
We need to talk.

00:30:17.482 --> 00:30:19.400
Will you stay by my side?

00:30:39.295 --> 00:30:40.505
What are you hesitating about?

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.173
Is it something exciting?

00:30:43.508 --> 00:30:44.592
Something scary.

00:30:44.843 --> 00:30:46.761
I'm not sure if I can handle it.

00:30:46.845 --> 00:30:47.887
Scary?

00:30:48.263 --> 00:30:49.264
Like what?

00:30:50.056 --> 00:30:51.266
It's just scary.

00:30:53.768 --> 00:30:55.353
Then throw it away.

00:30:55.436 --> 00:30:56.646
I wish I could.

00:31:02.902 --> 00:31:05.113
Why isn't he home yet?

00:31:10.743 --> 00:31:11.870
Man.

00:31:13.496 --> 00:31:14.497
What are you doing?

00:31:15.665 --> 00:31:17.208
Wait, who are you?

00:31:17.917 --> 00:31:18.918
"Who are you?"

00:31:19.002 --> 00:31:20.003
Are you serious?

00:31:20.545 --> 00:31:22.964
Don't you even remember the guy
you hugged last time?

00:31:24.883 --> 00:31:26.175
Go make some ramyeon.

00:31:26.801 --> 00:31:27.802
I'm sorry?

00:31:29.888 --> 00:31:31.681
It's for Jun-seo's stomach.

00:31:32.473 --> 00:31:34.767
He needs something spicy to sober up.

00:31:38.104 --> 00:31:39.647
Jackass.

00:31:59.167 --> 00:32:00.168
Gosh.

00:32:24.943 --> 00:32:27.403
I was worried
something had happened to you.

00:32:29.238 --> 00:32:30.865
It relieves me to see your face.

00:32:34.577 --> 00:32:37.789
In-gang,
are you thinking of retiring?

00:32:40.416 --> 00:32:41.668
Did Mi-ri tell you?

00:32:43.252 --> 00:32:45.630
Why didn't you tell me first?

00:32:46.547 --> 00:32:48.174
I didn't mean to hide it.

00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:51.302
It wasn't easy to make up my mind.

00:32:51.678 --> 00:32:54.555
I was going to tell you
once I was sure.

00:33:03.064 --> 00:33:07.276
Are you planning to marry me
after you retire?

00:33:12.156 --> 00:33:13.908
I thought we were on the same page.

00:33:15.952 --> 00:33:17.078
Was I wrong?

00:33:18.913 --> 00:33:21.624
Then you shouldn't have let it
become news.

00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:23.292
What?

00:33:26.754 --> 00:33:28.715
I feel awful.

00:33:30.466 --> 00:33:31.592
Do you have any idea

00:33:31.676 --> 00:33:33.553
how humiliated I was
in front of the director today?

00:33:35.054 --> 00:33:36.472
Why should I have to take

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:38.683
that kind of criticism
because of you?

00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:42.061
Ah-jin.

00:33:47.191 --> 00:33:48.568
Let me ask you one favor.

00:33:50.236 --> 00:33:53.656
You're a good guy who always
does me a favor when I ask

00:33:53.906 --> 00:33:56.200
so I hope you do it again this time.

00:34:00.496 --> 00:34:02.373
Let's break up.

00:34:11.466 --> 00:34:12.717
Hang on.

00:34:13.384 --> 00:34:15.303
What kind of nonsense is this?

00:34:15.386 --> 00:34:17.221
This is too sudden.

00:34:18.473 --> 00:34:19.932
I know you're angry, but...

00:34:21.768 --> 00:34:23.644
Are you even the same Ah-jin I know?

00:34:23.728 --> 00:34:27.231
And are you the In-gang I know?

00:34:28.524 --> 00:34:30.401
You're not in your right mind.

00:34:31.152 --> 00:34:32.820
You can't even control your emotions

00:34:32.904 --> 00:34:34.989
babbling about retiring
and fairy-tale dreams.

00:34:35.073 --> 00:34:36.783
Get a grip.

00:34:37.617 --> 00:34:41.537
Do you know how many fans you've lost
in the year we've been together?

00:34:41.788 --> 00:34:43.998
And now you want me to marry you?

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:48.961
Don't make me laugh.
And what about me?

00:34:50.296 --> 00:34:52.507
You want to put
a "married woman" label on me

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:55.843
while I lose my movie roles,
so I can watch as my career dies?

00:34:57.845 --> 00:35:01.516
How can a person change
so completely overnight?

00:35:02.767 --> 00:35:03.768
Why?

00:35:06.521 --> 00:35:08.314
You don't like the new me?

00:35:09.732 --> 00:35:12.777
Then would you rather have me
smile sweetly

00:35:14.153 --> 00:35:15.696
while I break up with you?

00:35:17.532 --> 00:35:19.242
Would that make it easier for you?

00:35:24.497 --> 00:35:25.957
We've been together a year.

00:35:27.875 --> 00:35:31.087
I thought I knew you,
and I was certain about us.

00:35:32.588 --> 00:35:34.715
That's why I pictured
a future together.

00:35:35.842 --> 00:35:37.301
Was that so wrong?

00:35:38.094 --> 00:35:40.096
You know how much pain
I'm in right now.

00:35:41.472 --> 00:35:42.640
Can't you even try to understand--

00:35:42.723 --> 00:35:45.059
Why should I understand you?

00:35:46.394 --> 00:35:48.312
It wasn't ten years,
not even five years.

00:35:48.396 --> 00:35:51.232
Who cares
about a one-year relationship?

00:35:51.858 --> 00:35:54.402
You thought I knew you? Well, I...

00:35:56.863 --> 00:35:59.365
I've never heard
such an arrogant thing in my life.

00:36:04.287 --> 00:36:05.955
I can't believe this.

00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:09.667
I wish this were a dream.

00:36:11.252 --> 00:36:13.129
Given your tragic life

00:36:13.212 --> 00:36:14.922
I'm probably not
even nightmare-worthy.

00:36:17.216 --> 00:36:20.136
Don't make a scene over something
as ordinary as a breakup.

00:36:27.143 --> 00:36:28.352
Ah-jin, what's wrong?

00:36:28.436 --> 00:36:29.478
Come on.

00:36:31.564 --> 00:36:33.399
- Don't do this.
- In-gang.

00:36:36.736 --> 00:36:37.862
What I'm about to say

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:40.239
will hurt.

00:36:47.705 --> 00:36:49.332
I'm already hurting.

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:54.503
You were pretending ignorance.

00:37:10.269 --> 00:37:11.395
But listen anyway.

00:37:12.772 --> 00:37:13.940
Don't try to avoid it.

00:37:19.946 --> 00:37:21.155
Your grandma's notebook.

00:37:23.616 --> 00:37:24.909
I stole it.

00:37:28.329 --> 00:37:31.707
I wanted to win her favor
so I could date you.

00:37:33.793 --> 00:37:37.046
She found it at my place a while ago

00:37:38.256 --> 00:37:39.465
and she found out...

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:42.677
what kind of person I am.

00:37:44.929 --> 00:37:46.055
And from that shock

00:37:47.306 --> 00:37:48.307
she...

00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:54.730
You understand what I mean, right?

00:38:01.988 --> 00:38:02.989
In-gang.

00:38:05.283 --> 00:38:06.284
How you fell

00:38:08.244 --> 00:38:10.204
in love with me...

00:38:12.623 --> 00:38:14.292
and what happened to your grandma--

00:38:14.375 --> 00:38:15.668
What the hell did you do?

00:38:18.129 --> 00:38:19.130
All I did was...

00:38:21.882 --> 00:38:23.843
tell her the truth.

00:38:26.304 --> 00:38:28.973
I asked what you did to my grandma!

00:38:35.646 --> 00:38:37.398
I simply told her honestly.

00:38:38.858 --> 00:38:41.527
For once in my life.

00:39:00.504 --> 00:39:01.672
Say that again.

00:39:06.093 --> 00:39:07.595
If you don't let go of me now

00:39:08.512 --> 00:39:11.098
you'll be in hell
every time you think of her.

00:39:12.308 --> 00:39:14.852
You're not the type of person
who can handle that.

00:39:18.356 --> 00:39:19.440
So, admit it.

00:39:20.733 --> 00:39:22.902
Our ending was already decided.

00:39:27.073 --> 00:39:28.949
I'll release the breakup article

00:39:29.033 --> 00:39:32.411
through a reporter I know
at the right time.

00:39:33.287 --> 00:39:38.292
The reason will be
"grew apart due to busy schedules."

00:39:39.794 --> 00:39:41.128
About Ms. Seo...

00:39:43.672 --> 00:39:45.633
I'll tell her myself,
so get some rest for now.

00:39:47.426 --> 00:39:49.553
You look like you haven't slept
since your grandma passed.

00:39:52.807 --> 00:39:53.808
Get a good sleep.

00:40:40.521 --> 00:40:42.064
It's me, Mr. Lim.

00:40:42.148 --> 00:40:44.024
What is it, at this hour?

00:40:44.108 --> 00:40:46.527
I think it's time to end
our little arrangement.

00:40:47.236 --> 00:40:48.237
What?

00:40:48.487 --> 00:40:50.614
Don't tell me
you're going to marry In-gang.

00:40:50.698 --> 00:40:52.074
No, it's the opposite.

00:40:52.158 --> 00:40:53.159
The opposite?

00:40:53.242 --> 00:40:55.494
Get a breakup article ready for us.

00:40:55.578 --> 00:40:57.288
Breakup? Hold on.

00:40:57.371 --> 00:41:00.416
Just write we drifted apart
due to our busy schedules.

00:41:00.499 --> 00:41:03.210
- You're seriously going through--
- As quickly as possible, please.

00:41:06.046 --> 00:41:08.924
CEO SEO MI-RI

00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:22.313
Hey, Boss.

00:41:22.396 --> 00:41:23.397
Where are you?

00:41:38.829 --> 00:41:41.040
Boss, don't pull over.
Just keep driving.

00:41:41.123 --> 00:41:42.416
You've got a tail behind you.

00:42:18.869 --> 00:42:20.079
Who are you?

00:42:20.371 --> 00:42:22.248
Are you a stalker?

00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:23.541
Or gangsters?

00:42:24.083 --> 00:42:25.960
You've got nothing better
to do with your lives?

00:42:27.586 --> 00:42:28.587
Get out.

00:42:49.316 --> 00:42:50.317
Get him.

00:42:51.026 --> 00:42:52.736
- No!
- Punk.

00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:13.882
Let's stop all this.

00:43:14.133 --> 00:43:16.010
Forget about Ah-jin now.

00:43:29.398 --> 00:43:31.567
She's not the right girl for you.

00:43:31.650 --> 00:43:33.110
We won't renew her contract, either.

00:43:33.902 --> 00:43:35.070
I know.

00:43:37.197 --> 00:43:40.075
All lovers break up in the end.

00:43:43.245 --> 00:43:45.205
This kind of breakup happens
to everybody.

00:43:47.708 --> 00:43:48.959
Just today.

00:43:50.669 --> 00:43:52.880
I'll let it hurt just for today.

00:43:58.636 --> 00:43:59.845
Just for today?

00:44:07.645 --> 00:44:09.980
Fine. Let's drink, then.

00:44:13.859 --> 00:44:15.611
Let's get totally wasted tonight.

00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:21.367
It brings back old memories.

00:44:27.414 --> 00:44:28.457
Thanks, Mi-ri.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.001
For what?

00:44:35.881 --> 00:44:36.882
Thank you.

00:44:40.177 --> 00:44:41.178
Silly.

00:44:41.762 --> 00:44:43.180
Pour me some more. Is this a joke?

00:45:09.248 --> 00:45:10.249
AH-JIN

00:45:22.636 --> 00:45:23.846
Hey, Ah-jin.

00:45:24.346 --> 00:45:26.849
Jae-oh, who was in that car
that was following me?

00:45:29.309 --> 00:45:30.310
Paparazzi.

00:45:31.562 --> 00:45:33.439
I talked to them and sent them away

00:45:34.189 --> 00:45:35.190
so don't worry.

00:45:37.526 --> 00:45:40.070
You didn't call me out
for something urgent, right?

00:45:40.904 --> 00:45:44.283
No, I'm a little tired today.
I'll talk to you later.

00:45:46.493 --> 00:45:47.870
I'll call you.

00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:26.325
What?

00:46:26.408 --> 00:46:28.035
HEO IN-GANG AND BAEK AH-JIN
BREAK UP AFTER 1 YEAR

00:46:28.118 --> 00:46:29.411
GREW DISTANT DUE TO BUSY SCHEDULES

00:46:29.495 --> 00:46:30.996
THE FAMOUS COUPLE
HEO IN-GANG AND BAEK AH-JIN

00:46:31.079 --> 00:46:32.623
ENDED THEIR RELATIONSHIP
AFTER A TURBULENT YEAR

00:46:40.589 --> 00:46:42.257
Ms. Seo, these documents are for you.

00:46:43.175 --> 00:46:45.010
Yes, fix the parts I marked.

00:46:46.261 --> 00:46:47.346
Where's In-gang?

00:46:47.596 --> 00:46:48.847
His manager called and said

00:46:48.931 --> 00:46:50.849
he just went to bed
after taking sleeping pills.

00:46:52.476 --> 00:46:54.311
He won't be up
until late afternoon, then.

00:46:54.895 --> 00:46:56.104
That brat probably skipped food

00:46:56.188 --> 00:46:57.731
and poured alcohol
into an empty stomach.

00:47:00.025 --> 00:47:02.194
Is there
a good hangover-soup place nearby?

00:47:02.945 --> 00:47:04.446
Are you taking it to him?

00:47:04.530 --> 00:47:06.573
I'll swing by his place
on my way home.

00:47:07.366 --> 00:47:10.953
I need to make him eat something
and pull himself together.

00:47:43.569 --> 00:47:45.487
I'm out of town right now

00:47:45.571 --> 00:47:47.239
but In-gang isn't picking up
the phone.

00:47:47.698 --> 00:47:50.075
He's just passed out
from drinking too much.

00:47:50.158 --> 00:47:51.660
I'm heading over
with hangover soup now.

00:47:51.743 --> 00:47:54.329
I'll feed him
and tell him to call you.

00:47:54.413 --> 00:47:55.414
Yes.

00:47:55.497 --> 00:47:57.165
Don't worry, In-mo.
Focus on your work.

00:47:57.249 --> 00:47:58.375
Okay.

00:48:21.481 --> 00:48:24.067
In-gang, wake up!
Time to fix that hangover.

00:48:25.277 --> 00:48:29.156
I brought you
some amazing hangover soup.

00:48:36.079 --> 00:48:38.373
He's still asleep, huh?

00:48:40.626 --> 00:48:41.835
In-gang!

00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:47.591
Where is he?

00:50:24.896 --> 00:50:25.897
In-gang.

00:50:27.983 --> 00:50:29.317
In-gang, no.

00:50:31.445 --> 00:50:33.572
No!

00:50:34.990 --> 00:50:37.409
No!

00:51:15.113 --> 00:51:16.114
Hey.

00:51:16.948 --> 00:51:18.241
Look at me.

00:51:19.284 --> 00:51:20.285
Ridiculous, right?

00:51:25.373 --> 00:51:26.374
What happened?

00:51:26.958 --> 00:51:28.376
You've never been this hurt.

00:51:28.877 --> 00:51:30.003
What have you been doing?

00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:35.217
I just got unlucky.

00:51:37.219 --> 00:51:38.220
How's Boss?

00:51:39.554 --> 00:51:40.555
What?

00:51:40.972 --> 00:51:42.015
Is she all right?

00:51:42.516 --> 00:51:43.642
Why are you asking that?

00:51:46.228 --> 00:51:47.938
As long as nothing happened to her.

00:51:59.533 --> 00:52:01.243
Who the hell were those guys, anyway?

00:52:01.326 --> 00:52:02.869
Heo In-gang is dead.

00:52:04.121 --> 00:52:05.497
Seriously? Was it suicide?

00:52:05.997 --> 00:52:08.250
But he recently broke up
with Baek Ah-jin.

00:52:08.333 --> 00:52:11.253
Wait, does that mean
he killed himself because of her?

00:52:11.336 --> 00:52:12.712
That can't be.

00:52:12.796 --> 00:52:14.089
Apparently, he had depression.

00:52:49.416 --> 00:52:51.251
What did you say to me before?

00:52:51.501 --> 00:52:53.295
What did you say to me last time?

00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:57.591
You said you were just going to have
a normal relationship and break up.

00:52:57.674 --> 00:53:00.093
You said yourself
that he wouldn't get hurt.

00:53:00.886 --> 00:53:02.137
You're hilarious.

00:53:02.762 --> 00:53:03.763
Why are you angry?

00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:07.184
Who are you to yell at me?

00:53:09.019 --> 00:53:11.229
He couldn't accept the breakup.
That's on him.

00:53:11.313 --> 00:53:12.981
I did everything I could.

00:53:13.607 --> 00:53:15.025
How is that my fault?

00:53:15.692 --> 00:53:18.820
It was bad luck on his part
that he ended up like that.

00:53:20.530 --> 00:53:21.948
That's not my fault.

00:53:27.204 --> 00:53:28.580
He's dead.

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:32.584
An entire family was shattered
in an instant.

00:53:35.212 --> 00:53:36.630
And that's all you have to say?

00:53:37.714 --> 00:53:40.300
You make it sound like I killed him.

00:53:40.383 --> 00:53:41.426
Didn't you?

00:53:43.595 --> 00:53:46.389
Did you think I'd feel guilty?

00:53:46.473 --> 00:53:48.058
Don't expect that from me.

00:53:48.642 --> 00:53:50.518
You're the only one
who'll end up hurt and disappointed.

00:53:56.858 --> 00:53:57.901
Can't you just...

00:53:59.736 --> 00:54:01.446
live like a normal person?

00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:08.870
It was my mistake
for thinking you had

00:54:08.954 --> 00:54:10.789
even a shred of humanity in you.

00:54:12.374 --> 00:54:14.626
How exactly
am I supposed to be human?

00:54:15.502 --> 00:54:18.255
Do you think things would have
turned out differently

00:54:18.338 --> 00:54:20.257
if you had pulled me
out of that bathtub?

00:54:21.299 --> 00:54:23.009
But you didn't.

00:54:23.093 --> 00:54:25.428
Jae-oh would have stormed
into the bathroom

00:54:25.512 --> 00:54:28.223
and smashed that woman's head,
but you didn't.

00:54:28.765 --> 00:54:31.017
And you dare to judge me?

00:54:34.854 --> 00:54:38.149
Did you just stand there and watch
because you had humanity?

00:54:40.193 --> 00:54:41.945
This isn't my fault.

00:54:42.988 --> 00:54:44.823
You made me like this.

00:54:47.534 --> 00:54:50.537
If you feel bad for me,
say you're sorry.

00:54:51.621 --> 00:54:54.291
Say you're sorry
you turned me into this.

00:54:55.792 --> 00:54:57.377
When you condemn me

00:54:57.460 --> 00:54:59.170
you're actually condemning
your past self.

00:55:09.347 --> 00:55:11.224
You can blame me all you want

00:55:12.642 --> 00:55:14.269
but I'll never blame you.

00:55:24.070 --> 00:55:26.990
If you want to leave me, then do it.

00:55:31.411 --> 00:55:33.455
Run away from me

00:55:33.955 --> 00:55:35.582
just like you did in the past...

00:55:37.625 --> 00:55:39.961
and I still won't blame you.

00:55:46.092 --> 00:55:49.012
Because you're the first person
I chose to keep by my side.

00:56:29.719 --> 00:56:32.806
I was afraid my grandma
wouldn't be able to get her surgery.

00:56:33.765 --> 00:56:35.392
Thank you, Manager.

00:56:36.059 --> 00:56:37.519
I'll never forget this.

00:56:37.602 --> 00:56:39.229
I'm not a manager anymore.

00:56:39.312 --> 00:56:41.856
You can call me CEO now.

00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:43.066
And just so you know

00:56:43.149 --> 00:56:45.276
I never forget
a favor I gave, either.

00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:46.569
Thank you, truly.

00:56:49.114 --> 00:56:50.115
Hello.

00:56:55.745 --> 00:56:57.497
You said you never forget
a favor you've done.

00:56:57.747 --> 00:56:59.416
I wish you massive success, Ms. Seo.

00:57:01.042 --> 00:57:02.335
Thank you.

00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:06.131
REPRESENTATIVE: SEO MI-RI
NAME: HEO IN-GANG

00:57:09.801 --> 00:57:11.719
I never forget
the favors I receive, either.

00:57:12.137 --> 00:57:13.680
I sure know
how to pick the right people.

00:57:21.980 --> 00:57:25.191
I just want to thank you.

00:57:40.582 --> 00:57:43.168
HEO IN-GANG

00:58:54.489 --> 00:58:56.241
Everyone ends up abandoned

00:58:56.908 --> 00:58:58.159
and broken in life.

00:58:59.452 --> 00:59:01.329
You were just too weak.

00:59:12.674 --> 00:59:14.842
I couldn't just fall apart with you.

00:59:25.061 --> 00:59:26.437
Please understand me.

00:59:59.012 --> 01:00:00.847
- Kick her out!
- Kick her out!

01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:02.515
Kick Baek Ah-jin out!

01:00:02.599 --> 01:00:04.350
- Kick her out!
- Kick her out!

01:00:04.434 --> 01:00:05.852
This is unfair!

01:00:05.935 --> 01:00:07.729
- Unfair!
- Unfair!

01:00:07.812 --> 01:00:09.606
Take responsibility, Longstar!

01:00:09.689 --> 01:00:11.524
- Take responsibility!
- Take responsibility!

01:00:11.608 --> 01:00:13.234
This is unfair!

01:00:13.318 --> 01:00:15.236
- Unfair!
- Unfair!

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:17.113
Baek Ah-jin is a criminal!

01:00:17.196 --> 01:00:19.073
- Criminal!
- Criminal!

01:00:19.157 --> 01:00:20.867
Kick Baek Ah-jin out!

01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:22.869
- Kick her out!
- Kick her out!

01:00:22.952 --> 01:00:24.579
Bring In-gang back!

01:00:24.662 --> 01:00:26.331
- Bring him back!
- Bring him back!

01:00:26.414 --> 01:00:28.499
Take responsibility, Longstar!

01:00:28.583 --> 01:00:30.585
- Take responsibility!
- Take responsibility!

01:00:30.668 --> 01:00:32.378
Bring In-gang back!

01:00:32.462 --> 01:00:34.380
- Bring him back!
- Bring him back!

01:00:34.464 --> 01:00:35.465
Baek Ah-jin!

01:00:36.716 --> 01:00:39.010
- Bring him back.
- Bring In-gang back.

01:00:39.761 --> 01:00:41.679
- Devil!
- You're the worst!

01:00:42.388 --> 01:00:43.931
Who are you? Move!

01:00:44.515 --> 01:00:46.851
I was her classmate.

01:00:46.934 --> 01:00:48.728
She doesn't deserve all this insult!

01:00:48.811 --> 01:00:50.855
- Where do you think you're going?
- Go away!

01:00:50.938 --> 01:00:53.441
- Come back here!
- Baek Ah-jin!

01:00:53.524 --> 01:00:56.152
- You're a devil!
- Bring him back to life!

01:00:57.111 --> 01:01:00.156
- Stop!
- Bring In-gang back!

01:01:00.448 --> 01:01:01.949
- Get away from her!
- Come here!

01:01:03.076 --> 01:01:04.786
Who the heck is she?

01:01:10.166 --> 01:01:13.252
Hey, I'm all filthy because of you,
so let me wash up first.

01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:15.963
Seriously.

01:01:16.798 --> 01:01:17.799
Hey.

01:01:23.054 --> 01:01:25.348
You have a nice place.

01:01:45.993 --> 01:01:47.662
So fancy.

01:01:48.663 --> 01:01:49.664
This is insane.

01:01:53.084 --> 01:01:55.044
You have lots of nice clothes.

01:01:57.964 --> 01:01:59.173
I missed you.

01:02:00.049 --> 01:02:01.926
Not bad for an orphan.

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:05.304
You're successful now.

01:02:05.388 --> 01:02:06.681
Impressive, friend.

01:02:12.562 --> 01:02:15.606
Bring me some booze.
You drink, right?

01:02:16.566 --> 01:02:17.567
Right?

01:02:22.613 --> 01:02:23.656
Get out of my house.

01:02:27.326 --> 01:02:29.370
You used to run loan-shark schemes
on kids back in school

01:02:29.454 --> 01:02:31.497
and now look at you.

01:02:34.709 --> 01:02:36.419
Let me try that scheme, too.

01:02:37.962 --> 01:02:39.172
How about 100,000 won a day?

01:02:44.635 --> 01:02:47.513
Don't pick fights you can't win,
and get out.

01:02:51.476 --> 01:02:52.477
Fine.

01:02:53.060 --> 01:02:54.061
For now...

01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:59.066
I'll take this and call it even.

01:03:06.783 --> 01:03:08.493
The public sentiment
is extremely negative.

01:03:08.576 --> 01:03:11.329
Longstar also hasn't made
a clear statement yet

01:03:11.412 --> 01:03:13.456
so speculative articles
are flooding in.

01:03:15.249 --> 01:03:19.086
The agency's actor is under attack,
and they're merely watching?

01:03:31.682 --> 01:03:33.976
I know you were digging
into Ah-jin's father's death

01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:36.312
and stopped
when you started working with her.

01:03:38.439 --> 01:03:40.441
I suggest you work with me now.

01:03:43.611 --> 01:03:45.905
We may not be able
to reopen the whole case

01:03:45.988 --> 01:03:47.824
but this will be enough
to drag her down

01:03:47.907 --> 01:03:49.617
since she lives off public image.

01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:52.119
Is this everything?

01:03:52.203 --> 01:03:53.412
Just a portion.

01:03:54.372 --> 01:03:57.458
I'll give you the rest
as soon as you agree.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.419
Think about it and get back to me.

01:04:01.671 --> 01:04:02.880
Ms. Seo.

01:04:04.382 --> 01:04:06.300
You do know timing is everything
with exposés, right?

01:04:06.384 --> 01:04:07.552
About that timing...

01:04:08.886 --> 01:04:11.138
The sooner, the better.

01:04:49.135 --> 01:04:50.261
What are you doing?

01:04:51.596 --> 01:04:52.597
I'm sorry.

01:04:54.307 --> 01:04:55.308
Ah-jin.

01:04:56.767 --> 01:04:58.477
Is this a new persona
you're trying out?

01:05:01.731 --> 01:05:03.232
Sorry about what, exactly?

01:05:04.567 --> 01:05:07.028
I truly want to apologize.

01:05:10.698 --> 01:05:12.158
For everything I've done...

01:05:14.744 --> 01:05:15.912
I'm sorry.

01:05:17.747 --> 01:05:18.748
Ah-jin.

01:05:20.625 --> 01:05:21.626
After all this time?

01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:35.097
I'm even on my knees.

01:05:38.142 --> 01:05:41.228
Won't you please accept my apology?

01:05:42.647 --> 01:05:43.648
Please?

01:05:57.411 --> 01:05:58.412
Why should I?

01:05:59.997 --> 01:06:02.541
Why should I accept your apology?

01:06:06.212 --> 01:06:07.213
Ms. Hwang.

01:06:07.838 --> 01:06:09.340
For kneeling once?

01:06:11.175 --> 01:06:13.135
Considering everything
you've done to me

01:06:13.219 --> 01:06:15.721
your knees should be
worn down to the bones.

01:06:20.559 --> 01:06:22.228
Deep down, you've been waiting

01:06:23.396 --> 01:06:24.647
for my apology.

01:06:30.444 --> 01:06:31.612
I don't need it.

01:06:34.782 --> 01:06:35.783
Is that right?

01:06:41.163 --> 01:06:42.748
Well, I apologized.

01:06:49.296 --> 01:06:51.173
Don't forget to tell Jun-seo

01:06:52.133 --> 01:06:54.552
that I came and apologized.

01:06:57.513 --> 01:06:59.306
Make sure he knows

01:07:00.391 --> 01:07:01.517
I got on my knees.

01:08:42.827 --> 01:08:43.828
Do you know...

01:08:48.082 --> 01:08:50.876
when I hated you the most?

01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:19.405
I asked what you did to my grandma!

01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:22.366
I admit

01:09:23.325 --> 01:09:26.328
that was my intention at first.

01:09:28.789 --> 01:09:30.040
But...

01:09:36.130 --> 01:09:37.548
I liked

01:09:38.841 --> 01:09:40.259
In-gang so much.

01:09:44.096 --> 01:09:45.306
So, I...

01:09:48.767 --> 01:09:52.354
wanted you to love me, too.

01:10:02.323 --> 01:10:04.408
I'll take care of it.

01:10:10.623 --> 01:10:12.416
I'll tell

01:10:14.293 --> 01:10:16.503
In-gang the truth...

01:10:20.174 --> 01:10:21.508
and end this.

01:10:29.850 --> 01:10:31.101
Look at me.

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:46.158
I still stand by it.

01:10:50.037 --> 01:10:51.038
The fact

01:10:52.623 --> 01:10:54.458
that you're also one of my children

01:10:55.918 --> 01:10:58.003
just like In-gang and In-mo.

01:11:00.047 --> 01:11:02.716
When your child does wrong,
you scold them

01:11:03.676 --> 01:11:05.261
and embrace them again.

01:11:07.805 --> 01:11:09.265
That's what a parent does.

01:11:25.030 --> 01:11:26.282
Ah-jin.

01:11:27.616 --> 01:11:28.826
Baek Ah-jin.

01:11:30.744 --> 01:11:31.745
Yes?

01:11:32.830 --> 01:11:34.290
You did wrong, didn't you?

01:11:40.421 --> 01:11:42.172
You won't do it again, right?

01:11:48.762 --> 01:11:50.180
That's good enough.

01:11:53.267 --> 01:11:54.268
Ah-jin.

01:11:56.186 --> 01:11:57.980
Here's what we should do.

01:11:59.648 --> 01:12:03.485
We'll keep this just between us

01:12:04.403 --> 01:12:05.612
and never tell anyone.

01:12:15.497 --> 01:12:18.500
My other babies must have arrived.

01:12:25.799 --> 01:12:27.468
Do you want to meet them?

01:12:36.602 --> 01:12:37.686
I hated you the most

01:12:40.064 --> 01:12:42.483
when you were kind to me
every once in a while.

01:12:53.035 --> 01:12:55.162
Because I would be tricked
by your kindness

01:12:57.206 --> 01:12:59.458
and start to fall for it.

01:13:06.173 --> 01:13:08.842
I was afraid of having
even a tiny bit of false hope.

01:13:14.598 --> 01:13:16.016
That's what scared me.

01:14:13.866 --> 01:14:15.909
Come on. Come.

01:17:01.825 --> 01:17:03.452
But now I know for sure.

01:17:26.433 --> 01:17:28.727
It's all my fault.

01:17:31.271 --> 01:17:32.606
Save her life.

01:17:37.444 --> 01:17:39.321
Please save her life.

01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:41.865
In hell, hope is...

01:17:46.703 --> 01:17:48.580
something you should never hold onto.

01:18:53.353 --> 01:18:55.480
They don't seem to know
who we are yet.

01:18:55.564 --> 01:18:57.441
It looks like he followed us
by coincidence.

01:18:57.524 --> 01:18:59.818
She's hospitalized at the moment.

01:19:00.485 --> 01:19:01.653
What would you have me do?

01:19:05.115 --> 01:19:06.241
Let's observe for now.

01:19:07.576 --> 01:19:11.121
Find out exactly
how they're connected.

01:19:11.204 --> 01:19:12.205
Yes, sir.

01:20:28.406 --> 01:20:32.744
DEAR X

01:22:52.258 --> 01:22:54.260
