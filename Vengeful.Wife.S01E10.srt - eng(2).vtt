00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.899
Why

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.179
is there no signal?

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:05.900
Honey,

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:10.019
it's a fine day today.

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:12.019
Do you want

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.219
to go out for a walk?

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.859
No.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.200
I can't see anyway,

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.540
so let's skip it.

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:31.700
Okay.

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:32.500
I see.

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:33.939
Dong,

00:01:34.379 --> 00:01:35.299
the fruits are ready.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.859
(Did he notice anything?)

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:06.500
Honey,

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.620
I just

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:08.860
sent Mu Feng to buy groceries.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.300
Tonight,

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.460
I'll cook personally

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.659
to entertain your best friend.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:15.639
No need.

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:16.400
Honey,

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.259
Na's too busy

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:20.240
to eat with us.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.960
Is that so?

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:25.939
(This manor's quite remote.)

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.860
(Just in case,)

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.352
(I must leave and call the cops.)

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:34.439
Xia,

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:34.860
Ye Dong,

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.539
I just received a call

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:37.419
and have emergencies.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.060
I'm leaving.

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:40.419
Xia just said

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:41.500
you're too busy

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.060
to stay for dinner.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.060
Seems

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.419
you know her best.

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:48.419
Xia,

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:49.740
just stay here.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.139
I'll visit you again.

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:53.939
Definitely.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:57.400
Ye Dong,

00:02:57.419 --> 00:02:58.240
look after her.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:59.680
Or else

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:00.939
I won't be polite.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.080
Honey,

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.379
when did you

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:15.699
make such an agreement

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:16.620
with your best friend?

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:18.360
I'm really curious.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.979
Can you tell me?

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:26.599
Want to know?

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:31.939
It's a secret.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:01.340
Qin Yufei,

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.539
go,

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:04.939
kill her.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.900
Me?

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.620
This...

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:08.580
No.

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:09.740
I can't do it.

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:11.900
This is your ticket to join us.

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:13.219
If she doesn't die,

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:14.620
how will you rise

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:15.740
to be the CFO?

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:17.699
I've never even killed a chicken,

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.600
let alone a person.

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:20.660
It's simple.

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:22.500
Hold the knife,

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.819
close your eyes,

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:24.819
and slash wildly.

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:25.939
That's it.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.819
Feng,

00:04:27.019 --> 00:04:28.060
you should do it.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.779
Qin Yufei,

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:30.540
Dong said

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.300
if you don't kill her today,

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:33.180
both of you

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:34.420
will die.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.699
Go.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.100
Hurry up.

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:12.160
(Na left almost an hour ago.)

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:14.519
(Why haven't the police come?)

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.639
(Anything went wrong?)

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:18.379
(This...)

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.899
Honey.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:28.959
Honey.

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:30.660
Honey.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.000
I called Dr. Zhang over

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:34.720
to check your eyes.

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:38.480
Okay.

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:39.360
Well,

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.220
thank you, Dr. Zhang.

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:53.319
Honey,

00:05:54.819 --> 00:05:55.920
why do you look

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:57.160
so nervous?

00:05:58.959 --> 00:06:00.100
Honey,

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:01.660
I've been hoping

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.100
to regain my vision.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:04.759
Of course, I'm nervous.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.980
It'll recover.

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:10.579
Hmm.

00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:14.500
Mrs. Ye.

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:44.939
Dr. Zhang,

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:46.339
how is it?

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:47.980
How is it, Dr. Zhang?

00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:48.860
Mr. Ye,

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.199
her vision

00:06:55.319 --> 00:06:56.220
hasn't restored.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.220
The pupillary reaction you saw

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:00.720
was a physiological response

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:01.879
to light.

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:03.500
Doesn't mean light

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:04.060
perception

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:05.379
or vision restoration.

00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:07.319
Mrs. Ye,

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.939
did you sense any light earlier?

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:11.519
Even the slightest glimmer?

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:15.100
Dr. Zhang,

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.860
is there no hope left at all?

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:19.079
In medicine,

00:07:19.259 --> 00:07:20.300
nothing is absolute.

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:21.699
We can hope for a miracle.

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:26.060
Mr. Ye,

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.459
I'll take my leave now.

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:29.312
I'll walk you out.

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:30.660
Thank you.

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.259
(I could deceive Ye Dong,)

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:47.779
(but not an ophthalmologist.)

00:07:48.779 --> 00:07:49.600
(Why did he)

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:51.019
(just lie?)

00:07:53.899 --> 00:07:54.540
Dr. Zhang,

00:07:55.379 --> 00:07:56.560
I keep feeling

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:58.500
she can see again.

00:07:59.019 --> 00:07:59.519
Mr. Ye,

00:07:59.819 --> 00:08:00.980
you're being suspicious.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.819
I've repeatedly verified

00:08:03.899 --> 00:08:04.939
with professional devices.

00:08:05.459 --> 00:08:07.079
The damage to her optic nerve

00:08:07.139 --> 00:08:08.220
is irreversible.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.300
No light perception,

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:10.720
let alone vision restoration.

00:08:11.139 --> 00:08:12.860
Didn't you explicitly demand

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:13.800
to ensure

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:15.420
she lost her sight permanently?

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:17.779
You know the consequences

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.459
of the method I used.

00:08:19.779 --> 00:08:20.740
It's irreversible.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:22.939
Stop being suspicious.

00:08:25.259 --> 00:08:26.660
I may be overly suspicious.

00:08:27.839 --> 00:08:28.579
Appreciate that.

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:29.939
Thank you.

00:08:29.939 --> 00:08:30.459
See you.

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:44.500
Ye Dong asked me
to check Lin Xia's eyes today.

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:45.919
I discovered

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:47.500
she's faking blindness

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:49.460
to deceive

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:50.259
Ye Dong.

00:08:52.419 --> 00:08:53.820
What did you tell him?

00:08:54.779 --> 00:08:56.259
I insisted that

00:08:56.539 --> 00:08:58.100
her vision hasn't recovered.

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:00.179
That rascal Ye Dong

00:09:00.779 --> 00:09:01.820
isn't decent at all.

00:09:02.299 --> 00:09:03.419
He demanded

00:09:03.419 --> 00:09:05.059
I completely blind her.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.519
I wanted to refuse,

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:08.440
but you insisted playing his game.

00:09:08.539 --> 00:09:09.720
Now it appears

00:09:10.059 --> 00:09:11.419
she has realized

00:09:11.419 --> 00:09:12.740
his true color,

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:14.059
or she won't lie to him.

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:15.700
Now the fun begins.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:21.440
Keep this matter

00:09:21.539 --> 00:09:22.320
quiet.

00:09:22.559 --> 00:09:23.200
Understood.

00:09:24.019 --> 00:09:24.779
I'm leaving.

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:46.379
(Lin Xia's in grave danger.)

00:09:47.139 --> 00:09:48.919
(Without alerting the police,)

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:50.379
(for now,)

00:09:51.059 --> 00:09:52.139
(I can do nothing.)

00:09:54.779 --> 00:09:55.379
Come in.

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:00.139
Mr. Cheng,

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:00.860
someone named

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:02.100
Kun Kaqiang is here to see you.

00:10:04.539 --> 00:10:05.259
Show him in.

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:06.019
Alright.

00:10:16.419 --> 00:10:17.100
Sir,

00:10:17.299 --> 00:10:18.019
why are you here?

00:10:18.899 --> 00:10:19.580
Take a seat.

00:10:25.279 --> 00:10:25.840
Mr. Cheng,

00:10:26.059 --> 00:10:26.740
your wife?

00:10:29.779 --> 00:10:30.379
My team leader

00:10:30.559 --> 00:10:31.320
asked me to verify

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.320
some details with her in person.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:34.580
Last time,

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:36.340
I wasn't sure if it was her.

00:10:44.179 --> 00:10:45.179
What unfortunate timing.

00:10:45.379 --> 00:10:46.360
As our equipment

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:47.419
is incomplete,

00:10:47.639 --> 00:10:48.460
I've sent her

00:10:48.539 --> 00:10:49.580
to another city's hospital

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:50.600
for convalescing.

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:51.419
Oh?

00:10:53.259 --> 00:10:54.799
Why didn't you go with her?

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:58.259
I couldn't.

00:10:58.259 --> 00:10:59.240
With so many surgeries

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:00.620
in our hospital,

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:01.539
I'm just swamped.

00:11:03.059 --> 00:11:03.379
Here.

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:04.139
Water.

00:11:04.139 --> 00:11:04.980
How about

00:11:05.659 --> 00:11:07.100
making a video call to her?

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:07.659
Is that okay?

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:08.919
Checking via video

00:11:08.919 --> 00:11:09.740
might work.

00:11:12.779 --> 00:11:13.460
Sure!

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:14.860
I'll call her.

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:27.500
Oh.

00:11:28.539 --> 00:11:29.580
She might be resting

00:11:29.779 --> 00:11:30.840
or receiving treatment.

00:11:31.019 --> 00:11:32.220
Let's try again later?

00:11:34.259 --> 00:11:35.100
Fine.

00:11:35.299 --> 00:11:35.740
Then

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:36.539
we'll wait.
