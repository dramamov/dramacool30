02:27.875 --> 02:30.875
- Good morning.
- I’d like to talk to Mama Koya...

02:36.750 --> 02:38.000
Mama Koya...

02:38.791 --> 02:41.041
A man wants to talk to you...

02:43.625 --> 02:46.375
I know... I was waiting for him.

03:00.958 --> 03:03.208
Ugh... This shit!

03:09.083 --> 03:12.875
Hi... it’s me... I can’t find the house!

03:14.041 --> 03:19.458
I don’t know... The weather, the
GPS stopped working... All fucked up...

03:20.916 --> 03:24.446
No, no; I’m already here! I
told you I would cover for you

03:24.488 --> 03:28.000
and I will... It’s just that I
can’t find the damn house!

03:31.333 --> 03:36.416
Yes, I’m on... 32nd and... Union Street.

03:37.375 --> 03:39.625
Yes, on 32nd.

03:41.333 --> 03:46.333
A house with a fence? They all have fences!

03:48.000 --> 03:50.708
Hold on... Let me wipe this...

03:51.125 --> 03:53.000
I can’t see anything!

03:55.541 --> 03:58.916
Oh, wait, wait! I think I found it!

03:59.958 --> 04:02.958
Yup, yup... I found it!

04:06.333 --> 04:08.458
Hasn’t she been in touch?

04:09.708 --> 04:12.250
Don’t we have another phone number?

04:13.958 --> 04:16.458
I thought she was living with her mother...

04:17.125 --> 04:21.208
So she’s bedridden... I see.

04:32.875 --> 04:35.583
It’s all dark... Nobody seems to be home.

04:36.916 --> 04:38.875
It doesn’t look good...

04:39.250 --> 04:40.708
The back door?

04:41.750 --> 04:43.083
Okay, I’m coming in.

04:44.916 --> 04:47.916
Are you sure everybody at
the agency knows I’m here?

04:48.791 --> 04:54.208
No, don’t worry... I
have 911 on speed dial...

04:55.166 --> 04:58.791
I’ll call you when I’m done, and
I’ll let you know how it went...

04:59.333 --> 05:02.708
All good... Okay... Thank you!

05:07.333 --> 05:11.083
I’m with the Cook County
Health Department...

05:13.625 --> 05:14.791
Irene...

05:17.166 --> 05:18.958
Anybody home?

05:40.791 --> 05:43.291
Oh, fuck my luck!

05:54.666 --> 05:56.666
911, what’s your emergency?

05:56.708 --> 05:58.000
Baby...

06:02.083 --> 06:03.750
Mrs. Sandoval?

06:04.291 --> 06:05.583
Baby...

06:15.750 --> 06:17.416
Mrs. Sandoval...

06:18.333 --> 06:19.625
Baby...

06:51.500 --> 06:53.583
My god!

06:53.625 --> 06:57.000
Mrs Sandoval! What
happened, why are you tied up?

06:58.000 --> 07:03.375
My baby... My child...
Where is my daughter Irene?

07:04.416 --> 07:06.250
She’s downstairs...

07:09.250 --> 07:11.375
It’s too tight!

07:11.708 --> 07:13.208
I can’t untie you!

07:13.791 --> 07:16.333
I’ll be back! I’ll find a pair of scissors!

07:43.875 --> 07:46.875
I’m sorry!! Lady!

07:48.750 --> 07:49.666
Lady!

07:50.416 --> 07:53.416
No!!

07:54.833 --> 07:56.750
No! Wait!

08:02.208 --> 08:05.208
No!!

08:15.250 --> 08:17.083
My god!

08:17.125 --> 08:19.041
Fuck!!

08:39.666 --> 08:42.333
It doesn’t matter that
it’s all clear, mom...

08:42.625 --> 08:46.541
Clear for the law doesn’t
mean it’s clear in my head...

08:48.166 --> 08:51.708
I need this vacation...
They owe it to me anyway.

08:53.416 --> 08:56.166
It’s a tour package that I
found in a travel agency...

08:56.416 --> 08:59.083
If I like it, we can go together next year!

09:00.541 --> 09:02.791
No, not this year, mom!

09:03.041 --> 09:05.291
I need to be by myself.

09:06.291 --> 09:10.375
Mom, don’t be upset! Please!

09:12.041 --> 09:16.166
I need to think! I need to... clear up...

09:17.041 --> 09:18.208
Hello?

09:18.666 --> 09:21.458
Mom? Hello?

11:22.541 --> 11:25.083
- Hi - Hi, how’re you
doing? How can I help you?

11:25.125 --> 11:28.124
- I’ve got a reservation.
- What’s your name?

11:28.166 --> 11:31.166
- M’am... - Thank you.

11:31.541 --> 11:34.250
- What’s the name? - Katia Montero.

11:34.416 --> 11:37.791
Be careful with the
door; it’s a little heavy...

11:39.375 --> 11:43.291
Here’s the living... the bathroom...

11:44.083 --> 11:47.083
And here’s your bedroom...

11:48.333 --> 11:51.333
- Here are your keys... - Thank you.

11:51.500 --> 11:53.750
Would you like me to open
the windows for you, Mrs...?

11:54.041 --> 11:55.083
“Miss...”

11:55.541 --> 11:58.875
- I’m sorry? - Not “Mrs.”... “Miss”.

11:59.708 --> 12:02.875
- Would you like me to open the windows?
- No; I can manage.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
- Thank you. - Okay...

12:09.416 --> 12:12.833
- Thank you very much, Mrs.!
- Not “Mrs.”... Miss!

12:12.916 --> 12:14.166
Miss!

12:22.625 --> 12:25.083
No gun shots, no sirens...

12:26.875 --> 12:29.583
Nobody misses Chicago...

12:45.083 --> 12:45.916
Pinky!

12:45.958 --> 12:47.791
- I’m so sorry; are you okay?
- Yes, I’m okay.

12:47.833 --> 12:49.166
What the hell is wrong with you?

12:49.583 --> 12:52.166
I’m sorry; she doesn’t
act like this usually!

12:52.500 --> 12:55.458
- We apologize! - Don’t worry! That’s okay!

12:55.500 --> 12:58.499
Cut it out, Pinky! Cut it out!

12:59.750 --> 13:01.541
Little shitty dog!

13:01.625 --> 13:05.083
I don’t know what was that about! I’ve
always had a good relationship with dogs...

13:05.333 --> 13:09.250
- It’s not the dogs, it’s the owners.
- How come?

13:09.708 --> 13:12.875
Rich people can’t travel
without their fucking pets!

13:13.083 --> 13:17.124
They drug them, put in a
basket and get them on a plane!

13:17.166 --> 13:19.458
When they wake up, they’re all fucked up!

13:19.583 --> 13:21.791
- You’re right! - I know...

13:22.083 --> 13:26.958
They get some kind of permit...
the name escapes me now...

13:30.166 --> 13:34.125
Yeah, that one! You speak very
good English! Where are you from?

13:34.375 --> 13:36.458
I’m from Medellin, but I live in Chicago.

13:37.041 --> 13:39.375
- Hi, I’m Katia! - Amalia Villarruel...

13:39.458 --> 13:40.744
Argentinian; right?

13:40.786 --> 13:44.708
No; Uruguayan. It’s pretty
much the same, but more humble.

13:46.666 --> 13:48.958
- Chicago, huh?
- Yes; have you ever been there?

13:49.458 --> 13:55.708
Ugh... I went there once... with my
ex-husband. You can keep it; I hated it!

13:55.791 --> 13:57.583
It’s not that bad...

13:57.625 --> 14:00.699
Are you serious? It’s
too cold! One day we had

14:00.741 --> 14:03.791
to wait for a cab and
I got frozen up my ass!

14:05.250 --> 14:07.958
I’m sorry! I got you choking
and spitting your drink!

14:09.791 --> 14:12.458
- Are you okay? - Yes, I’m fine.

14:12.625 --> 14:16.000
It’s that shitty Tequila! One of these
days you’re gonna kill a customer!

14:16.208 --> 14:17.791
The lady asked for a beer!

14:17.833 --> 14:19.541
“Lady”? I’m a Colombian girl!

14:19.583 --> 14:21.458
See? Now you are offending her!

14:21.500 --> 14:22.875
Colombian girl, huh?

14:23.625 --> 14:25.458
Who does he think he is??

14:25.625 --> 14:27.625
Please, tell me you are
not leaving any time soon!

14:27.708 --> 14:30.708
Relax; I’m not leaving at all! I live here!

14:31.208 --> 14:34.708
Oh, lucky me! No chance
of getting bored with you!

14:35.000 --> 14:38.833
No worries, Colombian girl!
We are just warming up here!

15:06.500 --> 15:07.875
Thank you!

15:08.750 --> 15:09.812
No, no more!

15:09.854 --> 15:13.166
Cheer up, Colombian girl!
Bring me a bottle, please.

15:13.625 --> 15:17.750
- I won’t be able to stand up!
- Stay seated! What’s the big deal?

15:18.833 --> 15:22.083
- You’re spoiling me rotten! - I hope so!

15:25.708 --> 15:29.083
That’s Renzo... Everybody
calls him “Don Gutiérrez”...

15:29.458 --> 15:33.000
He owns the hotel... He’s quite boring.

15:33.833 --> 15:36.208
He doesn’t drink, doesn’t
smoke, doesn’t dance...

15:36.458 --> 15:37.999
He doesn’t even get laid.

15:38.041 --> 15:40.083
Oh, how would you know that?

15:40.125 --> 15:42.750
We were married for almost ten years...

15:43.791 --> 15:46.791
- Life in a small town...
- Not much of a life...

15:48.083 --> 15:50.583
I wasn’t checking on your ex, anyway...

15:51.500 --> 15:54.458
Oh... You like fresh meat...

15:54.875 --> 15:57.375
That’s a very cute kid...

15:57.458 --> 16:00.833
Yeah, Marcos is cute, but he’s just a baby!

16:00.916 --> 16:03.916
If you’re looking for action,
I can recommend Mario...

16:04.291 --> 16:07.916
- Mario? Who’s Mario?
- The hotel masseur...

16:08.041 --> 16:11.041
- Masseur? - Aha...

16:11.625 --> 16:14.458
Does he do room service?

16:14.500 --> 16:17.500
FULL room service...

16:17.750 --> 16:20.750
I’ll keep that in mind.

16:50.916 --> 16:52.375
Babyyy...

17:02.500 --> 17:03.958
Babyyy...

17:21.250 --> 17:22.750
Damn it!

18:14.791 --> 18:17.791
I don’t think she could see clearly...

18:23.166 --> 18:26.166
Let me go get some men...

18:28.833 --> 18:31.791
- Let me check if we still have some traps.
- I’m coming right over!

18:38.208 --> 18:40.208
Ramona, let me help you!

18:40.625 --> 18:43.625
No, Miss Estela; don’t worry!

18:43.916 --> 18:46.916
- I’m fine! - Wow, this is too heavy!

18:47.000 --> 18:49.458
We have those carts! Have you
already asked Marcos to help you?

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
Marcos? He’s not here yet...

18:53.291 --> 18:55.583
Are you sure? He should be here by now.

18:55.708 --> 18:58.208
Yes, I’m sure. I haven’t seen him at all.

18:58.500 --> 19:01.250
Let me give him a
call... See if he picks up.

19:01.500 --> 19:03.791
Go ahead, call him. Ask
him if he’s coming or not.

19:48.166 --> 19:52.000
Good morning, Colombian
girl! Were you able to wake up?

19:52.208 --> 19:55.416
Barely... I had to bathe in coffee!

19:55.666 --> 19:56.805
Like a good Colombian!

19:56.847 --> 19:59.208
Why did you let me
drink so much last night?

19:59.291 --> 20:02.375
I’m not responsible; we just met!

20:02.458 --> 20:04.541
This headache is killing me!

20:05.875 --> 20:07.375
Oh, I’m sorry!

20:07.875 --> 20:09.166
I couldn’t help it...

20:09.416 --> 20:11.750
- Oh, this? - Yeah... d’you have cats?

20:11.833 --> 20:14.125
No... it wasn’t a cat...

20:14.833 --> 20:16.083
I’ll tell you some other time...

20:16.125 --> 20:18.416
Hmmm... mysterious woman!

20:18.458 --> 20:23.083
No, not at all... My life
is... basic and boring.

20:23.458 --> 20:25.333
It won’t be boring anymore!

20:25.666 --> 20:28.666
- True! - You’re here now!

20:28.750 --> 20:32.125
That’s cool! I need to get my bellboy!

20:32.291 --> 20:34.666
I think your bellboy
didn’t come to work today...

20:34.875 --> 20:37.000
Oh... fuck my luck!

20:37.541 --> 20:40.083
I guess I should call that Mario guy?

20:40.125 --> 20:42.125
Yeah, you won’t regret it!

20:42.833 --> 20:45.499
So much pimping; you
must be on a commission!

20:45.541 --> 20:47.791
You busted me!

20:48.083 --> 20:49.166
You’re nuts!

20:49.583 --> 20:51.333
Ouch, my head!

20:52.375 --> 20:55.666
Hey, how’re you guys doing?

20:56.083 --> 20:59.083
- Hi, Little Hugo! How’s everything?
- Tell him “fine”!

20:59.500 --> 21:01.166
This way, Don Gutiérrez! Follow me!

21:01.666 --> 21:03.375
Huh? Yes, I’m coming!

21:08.833 --> 21:10.583
This way...

21:17.541 --> 21:22.000
On the other side, we found
more animals just like this one...

21:29.458 --> 21:31.333
They say it’s a puma.

21:32.250 --> 21:33.916
- What did Yanay say? - Who?

21:34.125 --> 21:36.291
Yanay, the veterinarian
who was at the entrance...

21:36.916 --> 21:40.500
The same... A lion...

21:41.916 --> 21:43.874
...A lion that came
down from the mountains.

21:43.916 --> 21:46.916
We found something under those trees...

21:47.500 --> 21:49.000
Show us...

21:54.375 --> 21:55.708
- Where? - Back there...

22:19.625 --> 22:21.291
Don Gutiérrez...

22:21.750 --> 22:22.500
Shaya...

22:22.750 --> 22:25.750
Mama Koya wants to
see you before you leave.

22:27.708 --> 22:30.833
- I talked to Mama Koya this morning...
- What does she say?

22:31.416 --> 22:34.500
She says she saw an animal
jumping over the trees, last night.

22:35.083 --> 22:37.791
That it looked like the
Devil... or something like that.

22:38.125 --> 22:39.041
The Devil?

22:39.083 --> 22:41.083
It was a very dark night...

22:42.375 --> 22:44.291
But that’s what she says...

22:45.000 --> 22:47.375
Meh... Bullshit...

22:53.958 --> 22:55.166
Mama Koya...

23:02.250 --> 23:06.333
She says she saw the animal that
did all this... She says it’s a puma.

23:14.625 --> 23:16.666
It could be a jaguar...

23:24.416 --> 23:26.875
That it jumped over
the trees, like a demon...

23:27.291 --> 23:32.875
But... since it was so dark... she
probably couldn’t see very well.

23:34.041 --> 23:35.958
That’s what she says...

23:36.541 --> 23:37.625
A jaguar...

23:38.250 --> 23:40.875
Yes, a jaguar that came
down from the mountains.

23:41.958 --> 23:43.622
It’s possible... It could
have been a jaguar

23:43.664 --> 23:45.333
that came down from
the mountains for sure.

23:46.666 --> 23:48.791
- During this season? - Yes...

23:49.625 --> 23:51.375
It’s mating season.

23:59.750 --> 24:03.666
Motherfucker... Why do
you have to be so good?

24:04.750 --> 24:06.375
What can I say?

24:06.791 --> 24:10.208
Better say nothing... Conversation
is not your thing, anyway.

24:14.291 --> 24:15.500
Listen...

24:15.791 --> 24:17.583
Did Katia call you?

24:17.625 --> 24:21.083
- Who’s that? - Katia. She’s a friend...

24:21.166 --> 24:23.541
I recommended your services to her.

24:23.666 --> 24:27.125
- Nobody’s called me. - No? That’s weird...

24:27.291 --> 24:29.125
Do you wanna know what she said?

24:29.708 --> 24:31.666
She said I should charge a commission...

24:31.958 --> 24:34.125
We can give her a discount!

24:34.875 --> 24:37.125
You depress me... I’d better go.

24:37.375 --> 24:39.666
It must be your “morphines”...

24:39.916 --> 24:42.458
Endorphins, you idiot!

24:42.583 --> 24:46.250
God never gives a brain to
the ones with a good dick!

24:46.708 --> 24:47.958
I didn’t get that...

24:48.458 --> 24:49.708
Exactly!

25:13.291 --> 25:15.416
Calm down, Doña Magda...

25:16.041 --> 25:17.257
Everything will be alright.

25:17.299 --> 25:20.291
No, it’s not. He always calls
when he’s not coming home to sleep!

25:20.583 --> 25:25.833
Take it easy. I brought you
some tea to calm your nerves.

25:26.166 --> 25:29.500
I’m fine, but I know
something happened to Marcos!

25:29.625 --> 25:32.625
- Don’t say that, Doña Magda!
- We should set up some traps...

25:34.041 --> 25:36.166
- Let me check if we still have any...
- Don Gutiérrez!

25:36.291 --> 25:39.333
- Look who just arrived!
- Good morning, Doña Magda!

25:39.416 --> 25:41.875
What’s wrong? Marcos hasn’t shown up yet?

25:42.250 --> 25:45.333
- He didn’t come home last night!
- I’m telling her to calm down!

25:45.375 --> 25:49.374
- Calm down, please!
- Have you kept calling him?

25:49.416 --> 25:51.958
He’s not picking up, and it’s
going straight to his voicemail.

25:52.125 --> 25:57.625
- I think his cell phone must be off.
- He wouldn’t do that! He always picks up!

25:57.750 --> 26:01.499
Alright... Do you think we could
put together a search party?

26:01.541 --> 26:04.416
- Of course, Don Gutiérrez.
- We can hold off on those traps for now.

26:04.666 --> 26:07.958
- Let me call some folks.
- Okay, thank you!

26:08.541 --> 26:14.750
Thank you, sir! This morning, I went to
the police station, and they laughed at me!

26:14.833 --> 26:18.083
They say he must be
fooling around with some girl!

26:18.250 --> 26:22.000
That’s most likely the
case, so try to calm down!

26:22.458 --> 26:25.416
Have you offered the lady some tea?

26:25.750 --> 26:28.916
Here’s your tea. Go on,
drink it before it gets cold.

26:29.291 --> 26:32.375
Let me know when he shows
up so I can slap his wrist for you!

26:32.458 --> 26:35.041
Slap his wrist? I’ll whoop
his ass; that’s what I’ll do!!

26:35.875 --> 26:38.875
Whoa, see? That’s why he left...

26:43.000 --> 26:44.166
Gutiérrez!

26:44.250 --> 26:47.916
I already talked to the men. We’ll
get together by the lake in half an hour.

26:48.083 --> 26:50.458
- We’ll start searching from there.
- That’s fine...

26:50.541 --> 26:54.500
I’m picking up my son at the bus station.
If anything changes, just call me...

26:54.750 --> 26:58.958
If you haven’t found him by the time
I’m back, then I’ll join the group; ok?

26:59.083 --> 27:02.291
Let’s hope he hasn’t
come across that cat...

27:03.166 --> 27:04.583
I guess we’ll find out...

28:51.208 --> 28:53.291
I’m so glad you are back!

28:54.041 --> 28:55.708
Yeah, me too...

28:56.208 --> 28:59.083
Are you staying this time,
or are you just passing by?

29:01.166 --> 29:05.625
No... I’m not sure when I’m leaving
because I drop out of school...

29:07.791 --> 29:08.791
What?

29:09.500 --> 29:12.625
Yes... At least for now,
I’m not going back...

29:13.125 --> 29:14.916
But... But, Fabián...

29:16.708 --> 29:20.416
I mean... I’ll go back, but
it won’t be Engineering.

29:21.166 --> 29:24.458
- Okay, so... what will it be?
- I don’t know yet.

29:25.333 --> 29:26.749
I have to think about it...

29:26.791 --> 29:29.958
I always thought
Engineering was your thing...

29:30.375 --> 29:34.375
Me too, but I was wrong... WE were wrong.

29:36.166 --> 29:39.166
But, I don’t get it.
Honestly, I don’t understand!

29:39.208 --> 29:42.750
Dad, we won’t solve this
now! Give me some time, okay?

29:43.208 --> 29:45.000
Alright! It’s okay!

29:46.625 --> 29:49.791
No! Fuck it! It’s not
okay! Not okay at all!

29:50.000 --> 29:53.166
- God damn it! Fuck this shit!
- Yes, fuck this shit twice!

29:53.208 --> 29:57.041
Okay, fuck this shit three times
then! We won’t solve this now! Enough!

29:58.666 --> 30:00.875
Fuck this shit! Fuck it!

30:05.791 --> 30:08.583
Can you drop me in town?
I want to visit my mom...

30:09.708 --> 30:10.958
Can you??

30:12.583 --> 30:15.166
Alright... Alright.

30:31.125 --> 30:33.416
Son of a bitch...

30:39.583 --> 30:40.708
What happened, did you find him?

30:40.750 --> 30:43.916
- We found his clothes and his phone.
- Where?

30:44.125 --> 30:47.333
By the lake, near the hotel...

30:48.000 --> 30:50.166
The clothes have blood stains...

30:51.875 --> 30:55.125
Shit... Fuck... Fuck!

30:55.750 --> 30:57.666
What should we do?

30:58.541 --> 30:59.708
Keep looking.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.458
Should we call the police?

31:02.166 --> 31:03.333
We’re gonna have to...

31:03.791 --> 31:05.541
Who’s telling Doña Magda?

31:06.166 --> 31:10.125
No... There’s nothing to tell
her yet... I’m coming right over.

31:12.791 --> 31:16.166
That was Doña Magda’s only child...

31:17.291 --> 31:18.375
What?

31:18.791 --> 31:20.708
He was her only child.

31:27.208 --> 31:29.625
- So your name is... - Estela...

31:30.000 --> 31:32.750
- That was an old, old movie...
- Yeah, that’s funny...

31:39.375 --> 31:42.375
Pinky!

31:43.375 --> 31:46.375
Pinky! Sorry, Estela!

31:46.708 --> 31:48.333
Pinky!

31:49.083 --> 31:52.083
Pinky!

31:54.166 --> 31:56.208
Pinky!

32:02.291 --> 32:04.416
Mrs. Thompson!

32:05.791 --> 32:07.916
Mrs. Thompson, are you here?

32:10.000 --> 32:11.666
Mrs. Thompson...

32:17.791 --> 32:20.208
Mrs Thompson, is that you?

32:20.541 --> 32:22.958
Mrs Thompson, is that you?

32:23.666 --> 32:27.833
No, I’m not Mrs. Thompson.
And I doubt she’s coming...

32:28.208 --> 32:31.208
That’s weird; she hasn’t
canceled. Did you talk to her?

32:31.250 --> 32:34.999
I heard she was crying...
Something about her dog.

32:35.041 --> 32:37.208
Oh no, the little dog!

32:37.375 --> 32:40.958
It was a shitty dog.
Nobody’s gonna miss it.

32:41.333 --> 32:44.333
Mrs. Thompson will. It’s like her baby...

32:46.416 --> 32:48.708
- I’m Katia. - I’m Mario.

32:48.791 --> 32:51.458
I know. Amalia told me about you...

32:51.541 --> 32:54.041
- Good things I hope...
- Very good things...

32:54.208 --> 32:57.208
She told me you are very
good with your hands...

32:57.708 --> 32:59.375
Really? What else did she say?

33:00.500 --> 33:03.500
I have a little stiffness in my
neck... Is there anything you could do?

33:03.583 --> 33:04.416
Of course!

33:06.000 --> 33:07.875
No, I don’t want you to use any oils...

33:08.291 --> 33:11.124
I have to lubricate your skin.

33:11.166 --> 33:14.000
- Find another way to do that... - How?

33:14.291 --> 33:17.708
Just like animals do... Use your tongue...

33:20.958 --> 33:22.291
What are you waiting for?

33:25.166 --> 33:27.000
I didn’t mean you to kiss me...

33:27.875 --> 33:29.416
I want you to lick me...

35:15.958 --> 35:17.041
Let’s go!

35:17.083 --> 35:20.083
Hold on a second, give me a second!

35:25.666 --> 35:27.500
What’re you doing??

35:51.166 --> 35:54.125
I wanna go! I don’t wanna be here!

35:59.708 --> 36:02.708
C’mon, let’s go!

36:02.916 --> 36:05.875
Let’s go!

36:56.125 --> 36:57.250
Gutiérrez!

36:59.458 --> 37:00.083
Chief...

37:00.333 --> 37:01.708
Why didn’t you call us right away?

37:01.791 --> 37:03.916
We didn’t think it was necessary...

37:04.041 --> 37:06.291
You didn’t think it was necessary??

37:06.791 --> 37:11.708
We hadn’t found that yet. We thought
maybe he was fooling around somewhere!

37:12.208 --> 37:13.125
Excuse me!

37:17.416 --> 37:20.625
- Have you called his mother?
- No; not yet...

37:21.125 --> 37:22.250
What are you waiting for?

37:25.583 --> 37:28.583
It was Estela. There’s
trouble at the front desk!

37:28.875 --> 37:29.833
What kind of trouble?

37:30.250 --> 37:32.301
She says they found
blood! A lot of blood!

37:32.343 --> 37:33.041
What?

37:33.250 --> 37:35.958
Also... They can’t find Mario!

37:36.458 --> 37:39.999
- Another one “fooling around somewhere”?
- Let’s go!

37:40.041 --> 37:42.624
- Prieto, Prieto, over!
- Here’s Prieto, over!

37:42.666 --> 37:44.416
Rescue Team here...

37:44.625 --> 37:46.125
The men saw something...

37:46.208 --> 37:49.791
- Let’s go...
- Gutiérrez, let’s take the back road!

37:49.875 --> 37:54.916
...Some kind of animal! We don’t
know what it is! Please, come right away!

37:55.000 --> 37:56.125
On my way!

38:48.708 --> 38:51.708
Move, Alfredo! Hurry up, cabrón!

40:13.625 --> 40:15.041
It’s just the way you left it.

40:15.208 --> 40:16.666
Liar...

40:17.125 --> 40:18.916
The tires are worn out.

40:19.750 --> 40:23.000
I didn’t know you were so picky!

40:25.958 --> 40:27.666
Are you staying with your father?

40:28.708 --> 40:30.250
That was the plan...

40:30.708 --> 40:33.000
...but I’d rather stay here,
if that’s okay with you.

40:33.791 --> 40:36.791
Of course, son! You
know that’s what I want!

40:39.291 --> 40:42.833
I’m going to the hotel to get
my stuff... I left it in the Jeep.

40:44.125 --> 40:46.791
- Did you guys butt heads? - Yeah...

40:47.625 --> 40:49.583
As soon as I step off the bus.

40:50.458 --> 40:53.458
Son of a gun... You know your father...

40:53.708 --> 40:56.374
You should have seen his face when
I told him I dropped out of school...

40:56.416 --> 40:58.416
I can only imagine...

40:58.833 --> 41:01.791
What?? Fabián, what d’you
mean you dropped out of school??

41:01.833 --> 41:04.291
Fabián, come here! Fabián!

42:00.083 --> 42:01.375
Miss Montero!

42:02.916 --> 42:03.666
Yes?

42:04.833 --> 42:06.708
Someone phoned asking for you...

42:08.500 --> 42:09.500
For me?

42:10.125 --> 42:12.250
Yes... Long distance...

42:12.500 --> 42:14.375
The last name was Sandoval.

42:15.625 --> 42:16.875
Sandoval?

42:18.166 --> 42:21.166
Yes... I wrote down
the number. Here it is...

43:05.791 --> 43:06.583
Hello?

43:07.041 --> 43:08.666
Hi; who is this?

43:08.875 --> 43:09.775
Who are you trying to call?

43:10.333 --> 43:13.000
They gave me this
number. I’m Katia Montero.

43:15.000 --> 43:18.125
I’m glad you called! I’m
Irene Sandoval’s sister...

43:18.708 --> 43:21.708
You are the social worker who
visited her that night; aren’t you?

43:21.833 --> 43:24.708
Wait a minute... How did you find me?

43:25.833 --> 43:27.833
Your mother told me where to find you.

43:28.166 --> 43:31.041
My mother? Did you call my mother??

43:31.458 --> 43:34.458
Calm down! I’m just trying to help!

43:34.750 --> 43:37.750
Help? I don’t need any help!

43:38.666 --> 43:40.291
I think you do...

43:40.625 --> 43:42.125
I don’t know you!

43:42.833 --> 43:43.833
Wait!

43:44.833 --> 43:45.916
Don’t hang up!

43:46.375 --> 43:48.208
I have nothing to discuss with you!

43:50.625 --> 43:52.000
The changes...

43:52.791 --> 43:54.375
Have the changes begun yet?

43:56.666 --> 43:58.041
Changes?

43:59.333 --> 44:00.625
What changes are you talking about?

44:00.875 --> 44:03.166
You know what I’m talking about.

44:04.125 --> 44:05.375
Have they begun yet?

44:15.291 --> 44:17.750
Go ahead, here’s Chief Prieto, over!

44:18.958 --> 44:20.708
- What? - What is it?

44:21.083 --> 44:22.208
Where did you find it?

44:22.416 --> 44:24.333
- Who did they find? - Hold on!

44:26.666 --> 44:28.500
They found a leg.

44:37.791 --> 44:39.208
Get the coroner!

44:39.375 --> 44:42.708
We need to make sure that
leg belongs to the missing kid...

45:08.041 --> 45:09.833
They lied to me...

45:11.625 --> 45:13.291
Who lied to you?

45:13.583 --> 45:16.250
Amalia... She told me you didn’t drink.

45:17.208 --> 45:20.208
No, she didn’t lie. I’m
having a bad day; that’s all.

45:22.750 --> 45:26.000
- Anything to drink?
- Same as Don Gutiérrez.

45:29.916 --> 45:32.208
- I’m Katia. - Don Gutiérrez...

45:32.791 --> 45:34.375
Have they found them?

45:36.625 --> 45:39.291
Found? Found who?

45:39.916 --> 45:42.208
The bellboy and the masseur.

45:44.333 --> 45:47.646
No... We are looking for
Marcos, but nobody is looking

45:47.688 --> 45:51.166
for any masseur. I don’t know
who you are talking about.

45:52.166 --> 45:53.833
Mario...

45:54.625 --> 45:59.375
Mario... He comes and goes...
Nobody is looking for him.

46:00.333 --> 46:02.458
They lied to me again then.

46:02.708 --> 46:06.833
Nobody is lying to you. It’s just that
people talk too much... Excuse me...

46:10.333 --> 46:12.166
Colombian girl, I can see you!

46:12.541 --> 46:14.541
That’s because you’re watching me!

46:15.125 --> 46:18.125
I though you didn’t like older guys...

46:18.291 --> 46:20.833
- Anything to drink? - Whisky, please.

46:21.041 --> 46:22.833
We were just talking...

46:23.291 --> 46:24.875
Who’s that kid?

46:25.208 --> 46:26.458
That’s his son.

46:26.625 --> 46:27.625
Your son?

46:27.750 --> 46:30.750
No... Son of a some indian woman in town.

46:32.250 --> 46:35.250
So Don Gutiérrez does get laid then...

46:35.416 --> 46:37.250
Not with me he doesn’t!

46:37.791 --> 46:40.166
But Fabián is a very nice kid!

46:41.291 --> 46:42.750
He’s nice indeed...

46:42.875 --> 46:45.208
Colombian girl, you are such a cougar!

46:45.416 --> 46:48.000
Don’t judge me, Uruguayan girl!

46:48.750 --> 46:51.124
You got me into hunting cubs!

46:51.166 --> 46:52.625
Fabián is just a kid.

46:52.833 --> 46:54.375
Fabián is his name...

46:54.958 --> 47:00.625
There's a difference between
enjoying fresh fruits and eating seeds!

47:01.166 --> 47:05.083
It’s all your fault... You
got me into tender meat.

47:33.708 --> 47:36.291
I thought you wouldn’t come back...

47:36.791 --> 47:39.416
- I thought you would stay in Miami.
- Houston.

47:39.875 --> 47:41.083
What is it like?

47:41.375 --> 47:43.541
It’s big... Everything is big.

47:44.541 --> 47:45.958
So you didn’t like it?

47:46.541 --> 47:49.541
My life is here... I’m not sure.

47:50.500 --> 47:52.541
With your father at the hotel?

47:52.833 --> 47:55.416
With my mom... with the animals...

47:56.500 --> 47:58.166
And with me?

48:28.166 --> 48:29.958
Are they always this noisy?

48:30.166 --> 48:33.833
No... I don’t know; maybe he’s jealous...

48:35.750 --> 48:39.041
You know... your father was here today.
He came with Matías and other men.

48:39.666 --> 48:43.000
Yes... They’re looking for
Marcos... It’s not looking good.

48:43.625 --> 48:47.625
That’s not why they came...
They’re looking for a mountain lion.

48:48.458 --> 48:51.583
- I heard something about a puma.
- Mama Koya says it’s not a puma.

48:51.958 --> 48:54.750
- She says it’s a Nahual. - A Nahual?

48:55.208 --> 48:57.640
She tried to warn your father,
but Matías wouldn’t translate

48:57.682 --> 48:59.791
what she was saying. I
didn’t want to get involved.

49:00.875 --> 49:02.916
Why would Matías do that?

49:03.500 --> 49:06.687
Because he didn’t believe
Mama Koya... Because we

49:06.729 --> 49:09.958
are “indians”, and they
think we talk nonsense...

49:10.916 --> 49:12.916
I don’t get it. What’s a Nahual?

49:13.250 --> 49:16.649
I’m not sure... It’s like
an animal spirit that

49:16.691 --> 49:19.916
gets inside a person...
Something like that.

49:22.083 --> 49:24.878
Well... Matías was wrong
in not translating, but

49:24.920 --> 49:27.583
my father wouldn’t
have believed that either.

49:28.708 --> 49:30.500
What about you?

49:31.000 --> 49:32.500
I don’t know...

49:33.208 --> 49:35.375
Mama Koya is very scared.

49:35.833 --> 49:37.750
Mama Koya scared??

49:38.041 --> 49:39.875
Yes... Very much so.

52:50.083 --> 52:51.750
What’s wrong? Why are you running?

52:52.000 --> 52:52.916
It’s chasing me!

52:53.958 --> 52:55.666
- Who? - I’m not sure!

52:56.583 --> 52:59.583
- Did you get into a fight?
- No, mom; it wasn’t a person!

52:59.875 --> 53:01.041
It was some animal!

53:01.625 --> 53:04.502
Have you been drinking
Tequila with your father again?

53:04.544 --> 53:05.875
It was a mountain lion!

53:06.791 --> 53:09.791
Fabián, mountain lions
don’t chase bicycles!

53:09.875 --> 53:12.875
Well, maybe it was a biker cat
because it was hot on my heels!

53:13.375 --> 53:16.166
- That’s stupid! - Why stupid?

53:17.791 --> 53:19.583
Okay, if that’s how you want it...

53:22.958 --> 53:24.208
What are you doing?

53:25.041 --> 53:27.166
Can’t you see? My job!

53:28.208 --> 53:30.250
But those are tranquilizer darts!

53:33.125 --> 53:35.875
Fabián... I’m a veterinarian, not a hunter!

53:36.458 --> 53:37.750
No, mom, wait!

53:38.833 --> 53:40.041
Where are you going?

53:40.833 --> 53:42.416
Where do you think?

53:43.958 --> 53:46.791
Where are YOU going with that machete?

53:47.208 --> 53:49.916
What do you mean?? What if it attacks us?

53:51.000 --> 53:53.416
We don’t hurt animals, Fabián!

53:54.000 --> 53:55.000
Fucking this shit!

53:56.708 --> 53:58.541
What are you doing? This is dangerous!

53:59.250 --> 54:02.249
It’s not the first time we have a
lion coming down from the mountains.

54:02.291 --> 54:05.625
This isn’t a mountain lion!
Mama Koya says it’s a Nahual!

54:06.000 --> 54:08.333
Mama Koya has mushrooms for breakfast!

54:10.000 --> 54:11.083
Did you hear that??

54:16.583 --> 54:18.833
It’s on those trees...

54:19.750 --> 54:21.666
Shine the flashlight up there...

54:31.625 --> 54:35.125
- There’s nothing; I think...
- No... There’s something up there...

54:36.625 --> 54:38.458
Shine up there...

54:42.625 --> 54:44.166
Up there...

54:55.041 --> 54:56.875
- You hit it, you hit it!

55:36.375 --> 55:38.500
Can I get the machete now?

56:14.000 --> 56:16.500
- Good morning, Don Gutiérrez.
- Hi, Ramona...

56:16.666 --> 56:21.666
I wanted to show you this picture from
the night they found blood by the sauna...

56:23.125 --> 56:26.750
I haven’t seen this woman...
And you can’t see her face.

56:27.125 --> 56:29.250
I know, that’s the problem...

56:29.875 --> 56:33.076
With that poncho, I
doubt she’s a guest. It’s

56:33.118 --> 56:36.291
probably someone from
town or from the farm.

56:36.458 --> 56:38.833
- I thought the same thing.
- Have you asked Estela yet?

56:38.958 --> 56:41.500
- I was about to...
- She might have seen her when she came in.

56:41.750 --> 56:42.909
Estela, can I show you...

56:42.951 --> 56:45.041
Don Gutiérrez, the
sheriff is on the phone!

56:46.583 --> 56:47.458
What is it?

56:47.750 --> 56:49.500
They found Doña Magda’s kid!

56:50.875 --> 56:51.916
Where?

56:52.375 --> 56:54.333
By the lake, and he didn’t drown...

56:54.791 --> 56:55.874
- Are you sure?

56:55.916 --> 57:00.666
If I didn’t know any better... I
would think he was killed by a bear.

57:03.250 --> 57:04.541
What about Doña Magda?

57:05.083 --> 57:06.375
I had someone call her...

57:07.000 --> 57:10.000
I suppose we all knew this
wasn’t going to end well...

57:10.708 --> 57:14.041
- It’s not over yet...
- What do you mean, why not?

57:14.708 --> 57:16.458
This body has two legs!

57:17.083 --> 57:18.291
Are you positive?

57:18.916 --> 57:20.541
I’m looking at them...

57:21.625 --> 57:25.875
I think it’s time we start
searching for that massage guy...

57:31.000 --> 57:32.458
Gutiérrez...

57:33.291 --> 57:35.750
They found Marcos’ body; didn’t they?

57:37.000 --> 57:38.958
Dad! We have to talk!

57:42.708 --> 57:44.250
The three of us?

57:45.041 --> 57:46.833
Yes... The three of us.

58:59.416 --> 59:00.791
Hello?

59:00.833 --> 59:02.875
What happened to your mother...

59:03.416 --> 59:04.375
Who is this?

59:04.541 --> 59:07.125
What she gave me that night...

59:07.875 --> 59:09.291
Katia...

59:09.333 --> 59:13.625
I need to know if this shit can be cured!

59:14.083 --> 59:15.666
I don’t know...

59:16.500 --> 59:18.125
I don’t think so.

59:23.416 --> 59:25.708
At least not in Chicago...

59:26.416 --> 59:29.125
But where you are now...

59:30.083 --> 59:31.791
...there might be some hope.

59:32.333 --> 59:34.083
What do you mean?

59:34.708 --> 59:37.708
The indians... Ask them.

59:38.333 --> 59:40.125
They might be able to help.

59:40.458 --> 59:42.291
I don’t know what to ask!

59:42.583 --> 59:45.583
Ask them about the Nahual...

59:46.166 --> 59:48.500
I don’t know what a Nahual is!

59:48.750 --> 59:50.583
You are a Nahual...

59:53.833 --> 59:56.416
And you are running out of time.

59:57.416 --> 59:59.500
What do you mean I’m running out of time?

59:59.666 --> 01:00:03.541
The animal inside you
is taking full control...

01:00:04.750 --> 01:00:08.916
That’s what happened to my mother,
and you saw how she ended up.

01:00:09.958 --> 01:00:12.833
Your mother killed herself!

01:00:13.291 --> 01:00:17.125
My mother had been dead for a long time...

01:00:18.583 --> 01:00:20.958
What you saw was a Nahual.

01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:25.750
I decided to leave that house...

01:00:27.875 --> 01:00:30.208
My sister decided to stay...

01:00:31.166 --> 01:00:32.750
...and you saw how she ended.

01:00:34.583 --> 01:00:36.541
I don’t know what to do!

01:00:37.625 --> 01:00:40.625
I’m very sorry about all this...

01:00:41.666 --> 01:00:42.708
I really am...

01:00:44.041 --> 01:00:46.208
Ask the indians...

01:00:47.333 --> 01:00:49.875
Maybe they can help...

01:00:51.041 --> 01:00:54.041
I’ve done everything I can!

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.500
I’ve told you everything I know!

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.875
Good luck...

01:01:26.458 --> 01:01:28.291
Housekeeping!

01:01:36.083 --> 01:01:37.958
Housekeeping!

01:01:44.291 --> 01:01:46.166
Miss Montero!

01:01:48.208 --> 01:01:49.875
It’s me, Ramona!

01:01:52.083 --> 01:01:55.083
I can come back later, if you want!

01:05:28.833 --> 01:05:31.041
Mamá Koya...

01:05:35.041 --> 01:05:37.250
Mamá Koya...

01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:50.750
Mamá Koya mentioned a Nahual!

01:05:55.333 --> 01:05:57.250
Front desk...

01:05:58.416 --> 01:06:01.416
Your... your flight?

01:06:02.625 --> 01:06:04.333
Miss Montero?

01:06:06.458 --> 01:06:09.458
My apologies, I couldn’t
recognize your voice...

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.375
Yes...

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.333
Yes, I can call the airline.

01:06:18.833 --> 01:06:21.083
Most likely they will charge a penalty...

01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:23.666
Alright...

01:06:24.875 --> 01:06:26.958
Alright, I’ll let you know... Thank you.

01:06:50.208 --> 01:06:51.750
Mama Koya!

01:06:54.208 --> 01:06:55.458
What’s wrong?

01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:00.375
The Nahual is leaving...

01:07:00.833 --> 01:07:02.458
It’s leaving?

01:07:03.708 --> 01:07:06.083
It’s trying to escape.

01:07:06.708 --> 01:07:08.250
So that’s a good thing...

01:07:12.541 --> 01:07:13.447
Katia!

01:07:13.489 --> 01:07:16.333
I know; you don’t
need to tell me anything!

01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:18.458
You look like shit; what’s wrong?

01:07:18.583 --> 01:07:19.468
I need your help!

01:07:19.510 --> 01:07:22.291
You bet; let’s go to my roon
and I’ll give you some make up!

01:07:22.333 --> 01:07:28.125
No, no, listen... Is there an
indigenous reservation in town?

01:07:28.291 --> 01:07:31.458
Yes, they run a farm near the lake.

01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:33.416
- Can you take me there? - Sure; when?

01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:34.916
- Right now! - Right now?

01:07:34.958 --> 01:07:36.375
Yes, please!

01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:39.833
Okay, sure... Let me see
if I can get a golf cart...

01:07:40.583 --> 01:07:42.500
What’s the rush?

01:07:43.291 --> 01:07:47.375
My mom... she got sick and
I had to move up my flight...

01:07:47.708 --> 01:07:50.458
- I hope it’s nothing bad! - No, no!

01:07:50.916 --> 01:07:54.666
I mean, we don’t know yet. She needs a
medicine that we can’t find in Chicago...

01:07:55.125 --> 01:07:57.830
Look... Watch out buying
medicine from the indians!

01:07:57.872 --> 01:08:00.250
They’re natural but
they fuck up your liver!

01:08:00.625 --> 01:08:02.250
I have to try, anyway!

01:08:02.458 --> 01:08:05.541
Sure! Give me five minutes to
pick up my stuff and change...

01:08:06.125 --> 01:08:07.708
Thank you, I’ll wait downstairs!

01:08:07.791 --> 01:08:10.791
Katia, what they do have is a
great anti-wrinkle cream! Oh well...

01:08:15.583 --> 01:08:18.583
Why did I agree to come here today? Why??

01:08:19.458 --> 01:08:24.583
Estela... What does it feel to work
with primitive son of a bitch all day??

01:08:26.125 --> 01:08:27.583
With whom?

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.375
Never mind!

01:08:48.583 --> 01:08:51.123
We have to put together
a hunting party again.

01:08:51.165 --> 01:08:53.583
Estela, please ask
Matías to come see me...

01:08:54.333 --> 01:08:56.208
You didn’t listen at all!

01:08:56.291 --> 01:09:01.208
I heard everything you said, but we have no
time! We have a wild animal killing people!

01:09:01.250 --> 01:09:03.000
It’s not an animal!!

01:09:12.208 --> 01:09:13.208
Son of a bitch...

01:09:56.416 --> 01:09:59.416
- Ready?
- Yeah, they’re getting a car for us...

01:10:00.875 --> 01:10:05.375
Yanay! It’s been a long
time; what brings you here?

01:10:06.875 --> 01:10:08.583
Fabián is visiting us...

01:10:08.708 --> 01:10:12.041
Oh yes, I saw him the
other night. So handsome!

01:10:12.541 --> 01:10:16.625
Oh, lucky me! Are you Fabián’s mom?

01:10:18.041 --> 01:10:19.125
Yes...

01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:22.333
Have you met him?

01:10:23.041 --> 01:10:27.166
Not yet... But I would love
to meet him before I leave...

01:10:27.958 --> 01:10:32.875
She’s my friend, Katia. She’s from
Chicago, but she’s leaving already...

01:10:34.875 --> 01:10:38.208
That’s too bad... Maybe next time...

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.500
I’m still here.

01:10:41.875 --> 01:10:43.416
There’s the car!

01:10:51.375 --> 01:10:53.333
What happened to your leg?

01:10:55.083 --> 01:10:56.791
They tried to hunt me...

01:10:59.541 --> 01:11:01.958
- Does it have a full tank? - Yes, m’am...

01:11:02.083 --> 01:11:04.458
- Estela is looking for you... - I know...

01:11:04.708 --> 01:11:06.125
Thank you!

01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:11.458
We’d better hurry! Indians are like
hens... they go to bed before sunset!

01:11:16.083 --> 01:11:19.291
Estela... What do you
know about that woman?

01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:20.708
What woman?

01:11:21.416 --> 01:11:23.833
Katia... Amalia’s new friend...

01:11:24.166 --> 01:11:26.166
Oh... well, she’s from Chicago.

01:11:26.791 --> 01:11:27.833
When is she leaving?

01:11:28.333 --> 01:11:32.208
She was supposed to leave on Sunday,
but she asked me to move up her flight.

01:11:32.583 --> 01:11:34.000
I’m waiting on a confirmation...

01:11:34.208 --> 01:11:35.708
We can’t let her go...

01:11:36.458 --> 01:11:37.666
Excuse me?

01:11:38.250 --> 01:11:40.458
Haven’t you noticed
anything strange about her?

01:11:41.166 --> 01:11:46.625
I haven’t, but Ramona says her
room is a mess... And it stinks!

01:11:47.416 --> 01:11:49.375
I shouldn’t be talking
like this about a guest!

01:11:49.750 --> 01:11:51.916
Where’s Ramona? I need to talk to her.

01:11:52.291 --> 01:11:55.333
As a matter of fact, she’s
in Miss Montero’s room now...

01:11:55.541 --> 01:11:57.791
She’s been there for about an hour...

01:11:58.791 --> 01:12:01.333
One hour? Isn’t that too long?

01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:05.416
I guess... Not for a messy
and stinky room, though...

01:12:06.375 --> 01:12:09.375
- What’s the room number? - 406...

01:12:09.541 --> 01:12:11.041
- 406? - Yup.

01:12:11.583 --> 01:12:13.875
- Thank you! - Sure...

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.458
All the men are with
Chief Prieto by the lake...

01:12:17.583 --> 01:12:20.426
Prieto is looking for a
lion, and we are looking

01:12:20.468 --> 01:12:23.000
for a corpse... Those are separate things.

01:12:23.125 --> 01:12:24.791
It’s not a lion!

01:12:24.916 --> 01:12:27.916
Oh no? I know... It’s a Nahual... sure...

01:12:28.208 --> 01:12:31.458
A Nahual... That’s what
Mama Koya said the first day...

01:12:31.916 --> 01:12:35.166
Why didn’t you believe her? Why
didn’t you believe my mom either?

01:12:35.208 --> 01:12:37.361
Because they’re indians?
Because WE are indians??

01:12:37.403 --> 01:12:38.458
Let me get the jeep...

01:12:39.125 --> 01:12:43.875
Fabián, I love your mother; I
really do! But I can’t believe in magic!

01:12:44.458 --> 01:12:46.208
- Because she’s indigenous?
- No; that’s not why!

01:12:46.250 --> 01:12:51.083
Magic isn’t real; and I need this to
be real, so I can kill it! That’s why!

01:13:03.458 --> 01:13:05.333
Ramona?

01:13:11.375 --> 01:13:12.958
Ramona!

01:14:07.333 --> 01:14:08.666
Hi, everything okay?

01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:12.708
No... Mama Koya is
gathering all the farmers...

01:14:13.166 --> 01:14:15.416
They’re getting ready
to fight or something...

01:14:16.125 --> 01:14:18.333
What? What do you mean?

01:14:18.458 --> 01:14:21.458
She’s telling them the
Nahual is on its way here...

01:14:21.833 --> 01:14:23.250
She says it’s coming!

01:14:24.666 --> 01:14:26.541
I’m afraid something bad will happen...

01:14:27.166 --> 01:14:30.166
They all respect her and
believe anything she says...

01:14:30.916 --> 01:14:32.916
How about you? Do you believe her?

01:14:34.041 --> 01:14:35.291
I don’t know...

01:14:37.250 --> 01:14:40.041
I think I do... That’s why I’m scared.

01:14:40.916 --> 01:14:42.833
I don’t know what to do...

01:14:44.125 --> 01:14:47.541
Everything was ready for the little
indian bitch to move into the hotel...

01:14:47.833 --> 01:14:53.000
But I changed my mind and
decided not to sell, and I stayed!

01:14:53.833 --> 01:14:56.250
The hotel is mine too, isn’t it?

01:14:57.416 --> 01:14:59.541
You’re probably thinking I’m such a cunt...

01:14:59.750 --> 01:15:01.166
Not at all!

01:15:01.291 --> 01:15:05.458
Animals protect their territory, and
women need to stand their ground too.

01:15:06.208 --> 01:15:09.208
That’s why I like you, Colombian
girl! You’re just like me!

01:15:09.583 --> 01:15:11.208
That’s why we’re such good friends!

01:15:32.250 --> 01:15:33.166
Mom...

01:15:33.458 --> 01:15:36.458
- Shit, you scared me! - What happened?

01:15:36.791 --> 01:15:39.083
- Look at what I found! - What is it?

01:15:39.708 --> 01:15:42.291
- It’s the tranquilizer dart! - Dart?

01:15:42.750 --> 01:15:43.750
Yes!

01:15:44.375 --> 01:15:46.916
This is her room!

01:15:47.541 --> 01:15:50.958
- This is the Nahual’s room!
- What are you talking about?

01:15:53.125 --> 01:15:55.791
The maid came to clean
the room over an hour ago!

01:15:56.375 --> 01:15:59.166
She’s not there, and left
her cart here in the corridor!

01:15:59.375 --> 01:16:01.500
I don’t know, maybe she
had to use the bathroom!

01:16:01.875 --> 01:16:03.458
The room has a bathroom.

01:16:03.666 --> 01:16:07.333
Okay, maybe she had to go
get more cleaning supplies...

01:16:08.875 --> 01:16:11.875
You know where the
cleaning supplies are! Let’s go!

01:16:12.375 --> 01:16:13.124
Mom!

01:16:13.166 --> 01:16:17.416
The woman came to clean the
room an hour ago and now she’s gone!

01:16:17.833 --> 01:16:20.000
Are you gonna help me, or
do I have to do it all by myself?

01:16:20.708 --> 01:16:23.708
Mom, we need to calm down!
We don’t have enough proof...

01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:26.749
- This is all the proof we need!
- No; you’re wrong!

01:16:26.791 --> 01:16:29.375
The only thing that matters
now is to find Ramona!

01:16:54.166 --> 01:16:56.250
Wow... what a reception!

01:16:56.416 --> 01:16:59.333
- Are they always like this?
- No, not at all!

01:17:03.041 --> 01:17:04.666
Mama, look!

01:17:12.708 --> 01:17:14.333
Mr. Alfredo!

01:17:15.166 --> 01:17:18.625
Get all the men! All of them!

01:17:21.041 --> 01:17:22.583
I don’t like this at all...

01:17:23.208 --> 01:17:26.041
Easy; I’ve known these people for years!

01:17:27.916 --> 01:17:30.583
Alfredo, can you get Mama Koya?

01:17:32.541 --> 01:17:34.000
What’s wrong with this guy?

01:17:34.250 --> 01:17:37.250
- Lady Amalia!
- Shaya, darling... Is Mama Koya home?

01:17:37.916 --> 01:17:40.333
She’s inside... She’s waiting for you.

01:17:40.750 --> 01:17:43.875
Waiting for us? Did you call
them to tell them we were coming?

01:17:44.208 --> 01:17:46.041
No, I don’t understand!

01:17:51.750 --> 01:17:55.208
What?? Ramona dead?? What are you saying?

01:17:55.833 --> 01:17:56.875
It was the Nahual, dad!

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:00.030
No wild cat gets to a
fourth floor, kills a maid,

01:18:00.072 --> 01:18:03.083
hides the body and runs
away without being seen!

01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:06.041
Your mother... Is she okay?

01:18:06.833 --> 01:18:08.583
Mom is fine. She’s strong...

01:18:08.833 --> 01:18:11.833
- Estela is in shock, though...
- Have you called Prieto?

01:18:12.083 --> 01:18:14.958
The police is on its way;
I’m going to the farm...

01:18:15.625 --> 01:18:17.500
Why to the farm? What’s there?

01:18:18.083 --> 01:18:21.083
The fucking Nahual is on its way
there! You can do whatever you want!

01:18:23.041 --> 01:18:25.041
What are we gonna do, Gutiérrez?

01:18:25.458 --> 01:18:28.458
We are going to the farm too!

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.375
Mama Koya, how have you been?

01:18:38.750 --> 01:18:41.750
Is that the medicine for Katia’s mom?

01:18:42.916 --> 01:18:44.666
The medicine is for me.

01:18:45.416 --> 01:18:48.416
Someone who has been through
this before, told me ask the natives...

01:18:48.958 --> 01:18:50.166
That’s why I’m here.

01:18:50.625 --> 01:18:53.625
We know why you are
here... But we can’t help you.

01:18:55.875 --> 01:18:58.875
Can’t you, or won’t you?

01:19:05.583 --> 01:19:11.250
Mama Koya says she’s very sorry...
But your problem has no solution.

01:19:14.916 --> 01:19:18.208
Katia, sweetie... Maybe we should
go so you can tell me what’s wrong...

01:19:19.291 --> 01:19:22.583
Can’t it be healed? Can’t it be killed?

01:19:23.250 --> 01:19:24.708
Killed?

01:19:29.833 --> 01:19:33.541
She says the flesh will
die... but the spirit won’t.

01:19:40.708 --> 01:19:41.791
Thank you...

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.333
I just needed to hear that.

01:19:45.708 --> 01:19:46.541
Katia...

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.500
I don’t know what’s
your problem, but I know

01:19:49.542 --> 01:19:52.083
a homeopath in California
who does miracles!

01:19:57.125 --> 01:19:59.333
Katia, let’s get out of here...

01:19:59.625 --> 01:20:02.833
That’s a good idea...
You still have time...

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:04.833
Time for what?

01:20:06.958 --> 01:20:07.875
I’ll be right back!

01:20:09.625 --> 01:20:11.041
I warned you...

01:20:11.791 --> 01:20:15.083
Let me pay you... This was
a misunderstanding, I think...

01:20:16.666 --> 01:20:19.666
Let me reimburse you for
your services and for your time!

01:20:25.333 --> 01:20:27.083
Lady Amalia, no!

01:20:29.125 --> 01:20:31.500
Katia... Are you alright?

01:20:58.208 --> 01:21:00.333
- What’s going on? - We caught it!

01:21:00.416 --> 01:21:02.708
- What? - We trapped the Nahual!

01:21:02.791 --> 01:21:03.500
We killed it!

01:22:25.416 --> 01:22:26.666
Fabián, no!

01:22:26.708 --> 01:22:27.645
What is it??

01:22:27.687 --> 01:22:30.625
The children! They’re
playing in the caves!!

01:25:03.125 --> 01:25:04.458
- Hey! - What’s going on??

01:25:05.458 --> 01:25:06.833
Where are the others??

01:25:11.041 --> 01:25:12.250
Shaya!

01:25:13.250 --> 01:25:15.083
Don’t leave us alone!

01:25:24.375 --> 01:25:26.041
What happened?

01:26:57.833 --> 01:26:59.125
Close your eyes, baby...

01:27:13.083 --> 01:27:14.416
Are you alright?

01:27:26.250 --> 01:27:28.750
No, no! Stay there! It’s alright!

01:27:28.833 --> 01:27:30.416
Don’t look!

01:27:30.791 --> 01:27:33.333
No! Fabián! Fabián!

01:27:43.416 --> 01:27:44.541
Gutiérrez!

01:27:44.916 --> 01:27:48.208
I couldn’t kill it! Even when I shot it!

01:27:52.041 --> 01:27:53.333
Even when I shot it!

01:27:53.750 --> 01:27:54.583
Fabián...

01:27:54.833 --> 01:27:56.541
I couldn’t kill it!

01:28:15.750 --> 01:28:18.041
Wait... wait... Are you okay?

01:28:23.250 --> 01:28:26.250
Gutiérrez! It can’t be killed!

01:28:29.458 --> 01:28:30.541
Understand!

01:28:31.291 --> 01:28:32.625
It can’t be killed!

01:28:39.375 --> 01:28:42.416
- Thank you for your testimony, doctor...
- You’re welcome.

01:28:43.750 --> 01:28:45.333
Are you sure you’re gonna be fine?

01:28:46.166 --> 01:28:47.500
I’m sure!

01:28:48.541 --> 01:28:49.541
Good night!

01:29:15.125 --> 01:29:18.083
Sorry I had to borrow your lab coat...

01:29:18.291 --> 01:29:23.208
Calm down, doctor... Don’t be afraid...

01:29:25.375 --> 01:29:28.375
I need help, doctor...

01:29:29.416 --> 01:29:31.750
I need attention.

01:29:33.875 --> 01:29:36.458
Do you think you can help me?

01:29:37.166 --> 01:29:38.791
I... I’m a veterinarian...

01:29:39.791 --> 01:29:43.833
Come on, doctor... We are all animals!

01:29:45.583 --> 01:29:47.833
Look at me, doctor!

01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:51.916
Look at what they’ve done to me!

01:29:53.916 --> 01:29:55.958
Tell me, doctor...

01:29:56.416 --> 01:29:59.791
What do you do when they
bring you a wounded animal?

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.875
A horse with a broken leg...

01:30:04.166 --> 01:30:07.125
A dog infected with maggots!

01:30:07.416 --> 01:30:10.750
How can you prevent that
animal from going on suffering?

01:30:12.375 --> 01:30:16.833
You euthanize them;
don’t you? That’s your job!

01:30:18.333 --> 01:30:24.083
Look at me! Look at me,
doctor, I’m suffering here!

01:30:25.916 --> 01:30:28.916
Could you please show some mercy?

01:30:29.500 --> 01:30:32.375
Could you put me out of my misery?

01:30:32.833 --> 01:30:35.833
Could you please euthanize me?

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:46.416
You’re so nice...

01:30:49.041 --> 01:30:51.750
But here’s the problem, doctor...

01:30:53.083 --> 01:30:59.375
Mama Koya taught me that
flesh can die... but the spirit won’t.

01:31:00.791 --> 01:31:06.333
Even when so many things are
confusing since all this shit started...

01:31:06.916 --> 01:31:09.916
...that part I did understand!

01:31:11.541 --> 01:31:13.875
If this flesh is dying...

01:31:14.291 --> 01:31:17.666
...if this body becomes useless... then...

01:31:18.583 --> 01:31:21.583
-... I will need a new one! - No!

01:31:22.458 --> 01:31:24.500
What do you say, doctor?

01:31:25.166 --> 01:31:26.416
Should we switch?

01:31:30.916 --> 01:31:33.916
Let me go! Let me go!!

01:33:59.750 --> 01:34:02.041
- Yanay... - Mom!

01:34:05.166 --> 01:34:07.125
Mom! Mom!!

01:34:20.708 --> 01:34:22.291
Yanay!

01:34:48.166 --> 01:34:50.791
I don’t need you to save me, Renzo...

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.583
You should know that by now.

01:34:58.750 --> 01:35:00.541
Mom! Are you alright?

01:35:00.916 --> 01:35:02.958
Yes, son!

01:35:03.750 --> 01:35:05.208
Are you alright?

01:35:07.166 --> 01:35:09.041
Is everybody safe?
