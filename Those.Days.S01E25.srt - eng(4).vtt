=Those Days=

00:01:12.431 --> 00:01:14.800
(Adapted from iceread.com novel
"You Xi" by Qingyang Wanxi)

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.980
=Episode 25=

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.900
Hu Gang,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.340
our home Wi-Fi is down.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.180
Our Al home system has collapsed.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:23.540
Please come and fix it.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.820
That shouldn't be.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.340
I installed their Wi-Fi for them.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.650
I just installed it not long ago.
It shouldn't be possible.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:33.500
It malfunctioned, huh?

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.180
Great timing.
Let's head there and fix it together.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.840
Is the commotion
not huge enough for you?

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.300
Meiqi embarrassed me the entire day.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.660
She criticized me non-stop.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.020
I need to tell her that the bride is
the one paying me, not her, the bridesmaid.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.420
- Precisely.
- She shouldn't tell me what to do.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.700
If you go and argue with her,
you might get your revenge.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.980
But what about Bichen's wedding?

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:49.780
What a joke.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.540
Who said Yuan Bichen
couldn't get married without Feng Meiqi?

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.540
Today, I'm going to show her
who's the boss.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:55.540
What do you think?

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.780
Enough. You shouldn't.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.290
I want to show her who's the boss here.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.860
Bring it on.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:02.260
Meiqi?

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.740
Show me, then.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.380
So, you haven't left.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.710
How could I enjoy this fantastic show
if I left early just now?

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:23.300
Hu Gang.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.740
My mother always said

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.740
that you were honest and trustworthy.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.020
Is being fickle-minded
considered honest?

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:36.540
That's not it.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.460
Is being fickle-minded
considered trustworthy?

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.180
No, that's not it.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.780
You see...

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.140
Back then, you told me

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.140
not to find you again.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.820
I...

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.500
Bichen even wanted to break up
with Xu Zhidong, you know?

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.420
She even wanted an abortion!

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.540
Even so,
their relationship is still fine!

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.860
They're even getting married now.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.740
Calm down.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:52.940
Don't touch me!

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.500
You found out long ago, didn't you?

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.180
You didn't tell me on purpose

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.740
just so you could mock me, did you?

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.180
Meiqi, don't say that.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.180
Go away!

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:02.460
And you.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.940
You're Shen Mingzhu's bosom friend.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.460
I'm sure you know about
my relationship with Hu Gang.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:07.460
What do you mean by this?

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.220
Did you do this on purpose?

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.580
Feng Meiqi, you're so twisted
you're practically a joke.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.050
People mocking you
should be normal to you.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:15.220
Stop it.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.660
Come.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:16.860
Pregnant girl, go away.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.140
Let's try to reason this out.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.540
Hu Gang did court you,

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:20.660
but did you say yes to him?

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.900
When Hu Gang offended you,
did you forgive him?

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.860
When Hu Gang did
all those things for you,

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.100
have you ever thanked him before?

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.940
Don't bring that up.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:28.620
Go away.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.220
Feng Meiqi, do you truly think
that you're a princess

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.100
and the world revolves around you?

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.420
Do you even know the word "respect"?

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.060
Do you know how to respect other people?

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.540
If you lack a loyal and obedient lackey,
get yourself a dog.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.940
It'll wag its tail
in front of you all day long.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.300
And, it'll never retaliate
even if you hurt it.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.220
It'll be loyal to you forever.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.890
Hu Gang,
was that your true thought all along?

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.100
Was it true?

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.620
That's not it. I'm sorry.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:48.700
- Who said I wanted your apology?
- That's not true.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:49.820
Why are you apologizing to her?

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:50.380
Meiqi,

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.460
let me send you home, okay?

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:52.580
What are you saying?

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.580
I don't even have a home!

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.140
Shen Mingzhu, you're my sister-in-law.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.260
Is this how you treat me
after my brother's passing?

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:04.660
Hu Gang,

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.060
I'll remember this.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:10.380
Meiqi!

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.860
You...

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.100
Lend me your car.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.060
Hurry, hand me the keys.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.060
It's in the bag.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.180
It's in the bag.

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:20.820
- That lass...
- Slow down.

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:21.740
Be careful. You're pregnant.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:22.580
Slow down.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.900
Meiqi!

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:36.340
Meiqi.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.500
You don't depend on another person

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:40.940
to lead the life you want.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.300
You depend on yourself.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.500
It doesn't matter if you give
Mr. Hu your blessings or not.

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.860
(Grave of Feng Jianqi)
You need to learn how to accept reality.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.380
How can I live on

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.340
if I still dwell on
Jianqi's passing every day?

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.580
But I miss him so much!

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:26.220
I miss him too.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.660
Jianqi was the kindest person
in the world to me!

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.060
But he's gone!

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:40.740
You still have your parents.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:42.740
You still have us.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.860
I think I didn't handle this matter

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.300
appropriately.

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:58.900
Which part?

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:00.840
Now that we're in a relationship,

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:03.620
I think I should

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.060
tell her about it.

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:10.820
I know you courted Meiqi.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.280
But did she admit
that you were her boyfriend?

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.350
And, why do you need
to report yourself to her

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.260
just because
you're in a relationship with me?

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:21.980
I think that's unnecessary.

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:23.380
Yeah. That's it, then.

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:24.660
Hello. Please enjoy your meal.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:25.380
Thank you.

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:26.420
Come, hand the bowl to me.

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.380
In life, it's all about eating
and drinking well.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:37.420
Ni,

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.580
you don't seem
to have any worries, do you?

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.460
I don't have any worries?

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:44.950
You'll be shocked
when I tell you about them.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.260
But they'll be gone
as long as I don't think about them.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:50.440
You have such a great personality.

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:51.780
Unlike me.

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:52.620
When I was young,

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.780
even if I flunked just one subject,

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:56.620
I would dwell on it every day.

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.130
I would think about
this saying every day,

00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:59.940
"Learning without reflection
is meaningless.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.660
Reflection without learning
is dangerous".

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.820
If so, you should learn from
Luo Yin's example.

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.020
"Drink today's wine and be drunk today,

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.620
let tomorrow's sorrow
come with tomorrow".

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:10.500
Don't you agree?

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:10.940
Here.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.820
Actually, I knew about
your relationship with Meiqi long ago.

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:24.180
I always wanted
to uphold justice for you.

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:26.660
I think you're a nice guy.

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:29.050
And, you shouldn't play the role
of a dog in a relationship.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.220
But you couldn't curb your passion,

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:32.220
and you did it willingly.

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:34.900
Therefore, I could only
shake my head and sigh.

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:36.580
I couldn't do anything to help you out.

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:39.740
But why?

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:41.140
I have my own principles.

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:43.520
I can snag a bargain,
but I won't resort to outright theft.

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:47.900
Therefore, I only found an opportunity
when there was a crack

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.250
between your relationship with her.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:52.980
But to be honest,
I did set up an elaborate plot.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.700
Delivering meals to you,
pretending to be sick,

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:57.300
all those were parts of my plot.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.740
I've been really good
at this since young.

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:02.460
If so,

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:03.980
you...

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:05.850
You think that I've used Meiqi
to my advantage?

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.510
Why didn't it occur to you
that Meiqi was using you instead?

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:13.260
You provided free labor, and you followed
every one of her commands.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:17.420
I was merely lifting a finger.

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:19.260
So, you did it willingly.

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:23.180
If so, are you
still willing to do it now?

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:26.660
Tell me why.

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:37.620
It's because you were
treated with kindness.

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:38.980
You no longer want to be a suck-up.

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:39.220
I...

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.020
I wasn't a suck-up.

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:43.740
Let me ask you this, then.

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:45.820
What if I didn't exist?

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:48.450
Do you think you can maintain
a good relationship with Meiqi?

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:50.940
No.

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:52.040
That's all there is to it.

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:55.100
Since that's the case,
only fools wouldn't pick me.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.900
C is always the best answer if there
are three long and one short answer.

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:57.780
I'm C.

00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:59.320
You don't even need to know the answer.

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:00.700
Mr. Hu,

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:04.260
you see, the most important thing
in life is to be happy.

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:06.340
Understood?

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:07.820
Understood.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.940
The most important thing
in life is to be happy.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.350
- Understood.
- Let's dig in.

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:17.700
Can you be nice when we get back?

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:23.380
Alright. I'll go and return the car.

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:30.780
Listen,

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:32.540
I watched a short drama a few days ago.

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:33.500
It was terrifying.

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:35.100
You're back.

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:37.140
The princess is back.

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:40.540
Come, sit here with us.

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.020
I even had nightmares about it.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:44.380
What's wrong?

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:47.820
Why do you look so listless?

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:49.180
Let me see.

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:50.580
Who bullied you?

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.260
Tell me. I'll beat him up.

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.300
Who do you think you can beat up?

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:54.780
I'll.

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:56.260
It's you.

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:57.540
Me?

00:09:58.020 --> 00:09:59.180
But I didn't provoke you.

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.060
I told you to top up
our hotel's VIP card, but you didn't.

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:03.660
Great.

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:05.350
My superiors told me off
because of that.

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:07.900
That's it?
Do they even need to go that far?

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:08.940
Yeah.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.460
That's right. Top up your card.

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:11.940
I've permitted it.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.380
Tell your father to top up the card.

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.820
You need to use it
when you entertain guests anyway.

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:16.950
You should help our daughter out.

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:17.700
Mrs. Feng,

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:19.340
the soup ingredients are ready.

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:20.820
Please come and take a look.

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:23.180
Please check whether I've followed
your exact procedures.

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:24.460
Alright. Coming.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:26.220
Lass,

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:28.860
how many times have I told you already?

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:31.860
Don't wait around for things to happen.

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:34.480
You need to resolve the issues you face
with your own abilities.

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:37.220
You come looking for me
whenever you face an issue.

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:39.220
What if one day I...

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:41.120
What will you do by then?

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:42.060
No way!

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:44.620
Dad, you have to be around forever.

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:46.740
You have to live a long life.

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:49.940
Alright.
I hope your blessing will come true.

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:52.380
But I'm speaking the truth.

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:54.580
But Feng,

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:56.740
you can't just do this.

00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:59.100
Whenever we talk about Mingzhu,

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:00.060
you talk about unity.

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:02.310
But when it's my turn,
you talk about being independent.

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:04.820
I knew you were going to bring that up.

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:08.300
This time, I didn't top up the card
I used in Mingzhu's hotel either.

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:11.380
I wasn't partial at all.

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:12.780
I'm fair to everyone.

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:15.460
As if.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:19.540
Next time, when you come back,

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:21.500
you mustn't pull a long face.

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:25.180
You must smile when you see us.

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:26.260
Isn't that great?

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:28.940
That's it.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.250
Look at how beautiful my girl is.

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:38.180
Don't worry.

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:40.460
Meiqi has become calmer
after returning home.

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:41.620
She should be fine.

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:42.820
I knew it.

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:44.220
People are just like clay.

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:46.350
The more you mold them,
the more resilient they become.

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.420
You're quite concerned
about her, aren't you?

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:50.700
Why don't you offer Mr. Hu to her again?

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:51.700
What a joke.

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:53.460
Do you think I get to make the call?

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:55.360
You have to ask Mr. Hu
for his permission first.

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:57.740
I just think
that the lass has a rough time.

00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:59.950
She's in eloquent,
yet she has a fragile heart.

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:01.250
She doesn't know how to love people
when she wants to.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.340
And, she doesn't know how to
return the favor after being loved.

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:05.550
Perhaps she'll understand in the future.

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:09.950
In the past, it never occurred to me
how I should live as a single mother.

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.220
But look, my baby is this big now.

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:14.900
(Shocking Price for Gold)
Your belly,

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:16.820
has it gotten bigger again?

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:18.500
He's growing up at a rapid rate.

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:21.020
Dear baby, you're lucky.

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:23.140
Your mother is going
to buy gold bars for you again.

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:25.180
Let's go.

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:28.100
Hello.

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:30.140
Hello. What would you
like to buy this time?

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:32.220
The timeless gold bars.

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:32.820
Alright.

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:35.900
I want this, Peace and Fortune.

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:41.820
Alright. Here you go.

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:42.500
Okay.

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:45.740
Are you buying this next time?

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:47.700
I'll buy all of them
when I'm rich enough.

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:49.860
Aunt Ni, why don't you sponsor us?

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:51.900
No can do.

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:56.700
Look at our generous baby.

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:07.420
Hello, Mr. Zhang?

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:10.540
I'm Meiqi from Lijun Hotel.

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.780
I was wondering how you and your wife
were getting on with your plans.

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:15.180
We would be delighted

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:16.840
to host your son's
100th day celebration.

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.340
Oh, you're hosting it
at Manjianghong Hotel?

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:25.140
That's okay.

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:26.820
I hope we have the chance to serve you

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:28.180
in the future.

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:31.340
May your baby grow strong and healthy.

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:32.700
Okay.

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:33.540
Goodbye.

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:41.540
My mother made this beef sauce for you.

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:42.980
It contains black wolf berries.

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:44.100
Oh yeah, there's this too.

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:45.700
And this paper bag as well.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:46.760
It's dried bamboo shoots.

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:48.540
Cook them with roasted pork,
and you'll be in for a treat.

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:50.100
How can I finish them all?

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:50.740
You can do it.

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:51.740
Please help me thank...

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:53.450
Thank your mother on my behalf.

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:55.820
How is she doing?

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:57.300
She's doing great.

00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:58.620
You may not know,

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:00.700
but she's busy every day.

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:02.380
She prepares three sets of everything.

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:04.220
She's energetic way beyond her age.

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:05.540
If we were in the ancient era,

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:08.120
I suppose she could've joined
the military on Xu Zhidong's behalf.

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:12.620
So,

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:15.700
regarding my husband's selection,

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.950
have you received any news
from your father-in-law?

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:18.780
Not yet.

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.500
What about this? I'll head back
and ask him about it.

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:25.660
Mingzhu,

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:29.140
I know it's difficult for you
to ask for a favor there.

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:30.940
I must've troubled you.

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:31.820
I'm so sorry about this.

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:32.660
It's fine.

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:34.700
I only told my father-in-law about it.

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:35.940
My mother-in-law has no idea.

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:37.420
I'm glad that it's not troubling you.

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:38.060
Not at all.

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:40.780
If Zhang Hao is promoted,

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:42.580
he'll make an extra 10k or 20k per year.

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.920
You'll make the same amount
if you just publish a few more posts.

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:47.340
My dear sister,

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:51.340
you have no idea
how difficult it is to make money now.

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:53.820
Official accounts
are popping up everywhere.

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.260
Whenever there's a hot piece of news,

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:57.420
people will write about it
from every angle.

00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:59.620
It's truly difficult for me
to gain attention.

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:03.020
If your posts don't get many clicks,
they won't generate ad revenues.

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:04.580
Without ads,
there's no way to make money.

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:06.740
If there's no money,
I have to pay for it with my own.

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:08.340
I have to pay the office rent,

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:09.900
utility bills, management fees...

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:12.220
Oh yeah, and the wage of
my personal assistant.

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:13.580
I have to pay all of that.

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:16.100
Whenever I think about these bills,

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:17.660
I can't sleep at night.

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:19.820
It makes my hair fall out in clumps.

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:20.460
Is that so?

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:22.980
I suppose you have a lot of hair, then.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:26.380
It must've been tough.

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:27.980
Forget about

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:29.860
this tiny studio of ours.

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:33.540
Even those big-time clients

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:35.580
who've sailed smoothly for decades

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:37.460
will be knocked off their feet
by a single wave,

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:37.980
you know?

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:39.660
Such examples are everywhere.

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:42.420
I have to stop here.

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:43.690
I need to visit the F&B Department.

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:45.060
Someone complained about Rufeng Liquor.

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:46.420
I have to help
the suppliers deal with it.

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:47.620
Is that included
in your job scope as well?

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:49.950
Didn't I tell you already?
It's difficult to make money nowadays.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:53.940
I have to make sure
I provide good services

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:55.330
to my clients
while I can still move around.

00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:57.220
I'm going to keep every penny I earn

00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:58.980
firmly in my own hands.

00:15:59.260 --> 00:15:59.940
Let me join you.

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:01.560
- It's fine. Just resume your work.
- This is troublesome indeed.

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:02.860
Sorry that you have
to come here personally.

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:03.580
Mr. Ding.

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:06.380
All those alcoholics love to cause trouble
after getting drunk.

00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:08.260
But to us,

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:09.580
the customer is always right.

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:11.100
Please bear with it.

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:12.660
No problem.

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:14.020
Let's discuss this in the office.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.700
By the way, Mr. Feng has used up
all the money on his card.

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:18.540
And now, he owes us a few thousand yuan.

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:20.420
You know this too.
Business is hard nowadays.

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:21.580
Please tell him about it later.

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:23.140
That's fine. I'll pay it off after this.

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:24.260
There's no rush.

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:25.700
It just occurred to me.

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:26.740
That's why I told you.

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:27.380
It'll be fine.

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:28.860
I'll ask him to reimburse me later.

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:30.180
Okay. Let's go, then.

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:30.700
I'll make a move now.

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:31.650
Okay. You guys can go ahead.

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:32.580
Come. Over here.

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:36.300
What?

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:38.020
I owe them money?

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:41.300
So, how much have you paid
on my behalf?

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:42.780
3,500 yuan.

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:44.620
Okay. Sorry about that.
I'll transfer the money to you now.

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:46.220
Dad, it's fine. There's no rush.

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:47.300
I'm so forgetful now.

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:51.260
(Balance)

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:56.860
What was my password again?

00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:58.220
I can't remember it.

00:16:58.220 --> 00:16:58.940
Dad, it's fine.

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:00.160
You don't need to pay me back.

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:01.100
Don't worry.

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:02.020
I'll transfer it to you later.

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:03.460
It's fine. You don't need to pay me.

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:08.700
Lihua.

00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:10.060
Lihua?

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:11.820
I need to tell you something.

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:12.580
What's wrong?

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:16.700
Transfer 3,500 yuan to Mingzhu.

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:17.700
For what?

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:19.500
Why should I transfer the money to her?
Why aren't you doing it?

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:20.960
I didn't bring that much money with me

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:22.140
when I went to their hotel last time.

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:23.370
Mingzhu paid off
the balance on my behalf.

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:23.900
Transfer the money to her.

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:25.740
I'll transfer it to you
when I come back from work.

00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:29.700
You see, I forgot my password.

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:31.140
It's all because you drink too much.

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:32.460
You even forgot about your password.

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:33.140
Keep on drinking,

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:34.580
and you'll grow senile.

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:36.860
I'll transfer the money to her later.

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:45.460
Even those big-time clients

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:47.460
who've sailed smoothly for decades

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:49.420
will be knocked off their feet
by a single wave,

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:49.940
you know?

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:51.540
Such examples are everywhere.

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:52.340
(Usable Balance)

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:29.820
(Jianqi,)

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:32.620
(I'm going to secure
this house for my baby.)

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:34.380
(Will you blame me for this?)

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.180
(I'm going to do it even if
you're blaming me for it.)

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:38.700
(It's because I'm a mother.)

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:46.300
Are you saying

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:49.350
that you want to transfer
the ownership of this marital house?

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:53.620
This unit is registered
under Jianqi's name.

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:56.060
When Jianqi left,

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:57.660
you guys promised me

00:18:57.940 --> 00:18:59.420
that I would own this house

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:01.620
once I gave birth to your grandchild.

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:04.340
Back then, I didn't think much about it.

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:06.620
But now, my belly is
growing bigger and bigger.

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:08.860
I won't be able
to move around freely in the future.

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:11.160
Therefore, I want to transfer
the ownership of the house

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:12.860
while I can still move around.

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:17.100
I'm sure your parents
gave you that idea.

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:19.340
No, it's my idea.

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:24.060
The title deed is in Jianqi's name.

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:27.020
It'll be troublesome
to do an ownership transfer.

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:27.860
It's not.

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:29.280
I've already inquired about it.

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:30.850
I just need to get a notarized document

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:33.940
stating that you and Dad
will relinquish the inheritance right.

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:39.300
It's not like my parents will scam you.

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:40.860
Why are you getting it notarized?

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:42.420
Precisely.

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:45.340
We're a family.

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:49.020
We will keep our promise.

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:50.140
Besides,

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:52.700
the title deed is in Jianqi's name.

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:54.260
That means the house is yours.

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:57.540
The house isn't mine

00:19:58.180 --> 00:19:59.950
as long as the title deed
isn't in my name.

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:06.860
But what if you get remarried?

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:08.700
This is pre-marital property.

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:11.340
I'm securing it for my child.

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:13.420
Once I give birth to my child,

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:15.060
I'll include his name in the title deed.

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:17.780
If so, you can just add
the child's name to the title deed

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:19.500
once he's born.

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:21.450
Why go through all that trouble?

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:24.180
What about my interest as his mother?

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:27.420
Did you decide to give birth to a child
only because of the interest?

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:32.180
I decided to have a child first.

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:35.300
That's why I'm trying to secure
our interests here.

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:35.900
Wait.

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:38.940
Our family helped out
in decorating the house

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:39.890
and the children's room.

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:41.100
Isn't that good enough?

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:43.100
Must you talk about
such materialistic things...

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:44.540
Enough.

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:49.300
We should keep our promise.

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:54.140
Mingzhu, go and perform the procedure.

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:56.050
We'll do our best to cooperate with you.

00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:57.500
Thank you, Dad.

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:00.700
I'll head to work now.

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:06.060
Let's eat.

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:15.860
That was too hasty.

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.860
You told your parents-in-law that you
wanted to do an ownership transfer,

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:20.120
and they actually agreed to it?

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:23.940
But I offended
my mother-in-law and Meiqi again.

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:26.140
That's fine.

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:28.240
If you don't offend them,
you'll swallow grievances.

00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:31.020
Yesterday, I saw my father-in-law's

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:32.180
Alipay account.

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:33.940
He only has a few hundred yuan left.

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:36.660
I was wondering if his company
is facing some sort of trouble.

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:40.060
It won't be that bad.

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:43.900
Anyway, I want to help my child

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:45.700
to hold on to everything

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:46.820
that I can grasp in my hand.

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:52.860
Am I being too selfish?

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:55.140
How is this selfish?

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:56.420
You're doing this for your child.

00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:57.580
It's not selfish at all.

00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:58.680
Besides, your parents-in-law

00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:00.220
already promised to give you the house.

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:00.780
Am I right?

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:02.620
It's time for them
to keep their promise.

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:03.980
I suppose you could say that.

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:06.260
Anyway, my mother-in-law and Meiqi

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:07.460
were quite upset.

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:10.740
Meiqi is upset, huh?

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:12.900
Oh no.

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:13.620
What's wrong?

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:15.440
Will it affect her
from being Bichen's bridesmaid?

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:22.900
Please sign here.

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:23.660
Okay.

00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:28.300
(Real Estate Registration)

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:31.900
Here you go.

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:34.620
Keep it well.

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:36.380
Is that all?

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:36.980
Yes.

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:37.540
Okay.

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:39.260
(People's Republic of China

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:40.100
Here.

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:40.980
(Shen Mingzhu)

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:41.860
Shen Mingzhu.

00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:45.180
All done.

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:47.380
The ownership has been transferred.

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:49.700
Your name is in the title deed now.

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:51.140
You can rest at ease now.

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:52.500
Thank you, Mom.

00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:55.340
Mingzhu,

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:59.620
we also have some conditions
that you need to fulfill.

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:00.550
Is that okay with you?

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:02.060
Please go ahead.

00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:03.660
First condition,

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:06.060
you cannot take any men home.

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:08.380
I won't.

00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:10.220
Once the child is born,

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:12.750
you need to include the child's name
in the title deed as well.

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:14.580
And,

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:16.780
the child's surname must be Feng.

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:19.980
Jianqi and I have already
reached a consensus.

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:21.780
If it's a boy,
we'll call him Feng Xiangru.

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:23.440
If it's a girl,
we'll call her Feng Yimo.

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:24.820
- That's pretty good.
- I like that.

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:26.100
Their names are pretty nice.

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:27.020
Yeah.

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:28.220
What if...

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:31.380
You see, this house

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:33.420
is a cherished memory
Jianqi had left for us.

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:34.140
You know this too.

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:36.100
Your mother-in-law and I
only have one son.

00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:40.300
We're also willing to give the house

00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:42.060
to you and your child.

00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:46.150
I also have one condition.

00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:48.660
In the future,

00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:51.360
no matter how difficult life is,
no matter how much money you need,

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:53.860
you mustn't use it as a mortgage.

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:56.060
Dad, Mom,

00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:57.340
don't worry.

00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:59.940
You guys bought this house for your son.

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:02.950
Since Jianqi wasn't
fortunate enough to live here,

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:04.780
he's leaving it to his son.

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:07.700
I'm just looking after it for him.

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:12.180
Okay. Thank you.

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:13.580
Here, take it.

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:15.780
Thank you, Dad and Mom.

00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:28.220
Mingzhu.

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:30.020
You're a house owner now.

00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:30.900
Mingzhu.

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:32.280
You should give me a red packet.

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:34.450
Stop causing trouble.

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:35.780
You have to give me one.

00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:38.140
If not, I'll cause trouble for you
at your new house every day.

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:39.060
Feng and his family

00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:41.020
did keep their promise.
They're quite credible.

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:42.820
Our daughter did great.

00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:45.000
Now that she owns a house,

00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:47.980
she'll face much less financial pressure
after she gives birth to her child.

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:48.640
Don't you agree?

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:50.100
It's a safety net.

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:56.300
(Shen Mingzhu)

00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:58.660
(People's Republic of China
Real Estate Ownership Certificate)

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:07.160
The two kids,

00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:09.660
they wrote quite a long list.
They've invited plenty of people.

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:10.780
Is that so? I'll take a look.

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:12.780
Where are you going? Sit down.

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:14.020
What's wrong? What's the big deal?

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:14.940
Just sit down.

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:16.420
You scared me.

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:17.620
Listen.

00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:19.460
Now, we need to learn

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:20.780
how to let go.

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:22.660
Understood?

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:25.340
Who's next?

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:27.620
Shen Mingzhu and her family.

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:29.980
This is a model example.

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:35.660
I heard from Meiqi that Mingzhu had a
heartfelt conversation with her parents.

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:37.620
They gave her the marital house.

00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:38.580
That's a good thing.

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:40.340
Initially, I thought

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:42.020
your sister looked weak and gentle.

00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:43.480
But in reality, she's top-notch.

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:44.660
Of course.

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:47.060
Of course my second sister is top-notch.

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:49.900
When you wanted to get an abortion,
nobody could stop you.

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:52.060
But when my sister showed up,
you yielded immediately.

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.380
Just tell me whether or not
that was your fault.

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:55.900
Wasn't that your fault?

00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:56.640
Lower your volume.

00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:57.540
Be careful.

00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:58.340
Mind your tummy.

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:00.300
Now, there's another life within you.

00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:10.500
Xiu'e.

00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:19.340
Mr. Shen.

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:27.340
Mr. Shen.

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:30.140
- What's wrong?
- I...

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:31.180
Hey.

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:32.020
You see...

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:34.540
- You...
- Yeah.

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:36.420
Why don't you come inside?

00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:38.140
Don't. It's almost lunchtime.

00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:40.020
We can hold the conversation here.

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:42.500
Yeah. Let's hold it here.

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:44.300
You see, Zhidong...

00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:46.940
My son, Zhidong, is getting married.

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.620
I'm here to deliver
the wedding invitation.

00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:49.860
You guys are our VIPs.

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:53.100
I have to invite you two personally.

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:55.460
Mrs. Xu, you see,

00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:57.340
we've been quite busy lately.

00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:57.820
Yeah.

00:26:57.820 --> 00:26:59.260
But don't worry. We'll surely
give you guys the gift money.

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:00.780
But we won't be attending the wedding.

00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:02.060
That's not it.

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:03.500
I'm not here to demand
gift money from your family.

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:04.060
I'm serious.

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:05.740
The gift money doesn't matter to us.

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:08.220
You see, I came here

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:10.820
to invite you all to
my son's wedding earnestly.

00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:12.580
I also wish to use this opportunity

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:15.900
to ease the tension
between our families.

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:17.180
Ease the tension?

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:19.500
Our families have a great relationship.

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:20.500
There's no tension at all.

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:21.660
We don't need it.

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:22.580
You're overthinking it.

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:23.940
That's not it, Xiu'e.

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:26.780
Xiu'e, you see, what happened in the past

00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:28.780
was my fault.

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:29.860
I'm serious.

00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:31.500
Let me apologize to you two.

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:34.140
I'm so sorry about it.

00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:35.700
I've let you guys down.

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:36.460
Don't say that.

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:38.580
You see, I'm a fool.

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:40.420
I might be harsh at times.

00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:42.300
Please don't hold it against me.

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:45.380
Please don't hold a grudge against me.

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:47.580
You see, recently,

00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:49.460
I've been reflecting upon my actions.

00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:52.460
And now, I finally understand.

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:54.980
No matter what, you guys were the ones

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:57.340
who raised Mingzhu

00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:59.220
and allowed her to thrive.

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:00.900
And, you guys did a great job too.

00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:02.020
Don't you agree?

00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:04.420
I'm hugely indebted to you two.

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:06.820
There's no way
I can repay your kindness.

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:07.500
Am I right?

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:09.260
To be honest,

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:11.620
you two are more fitting

00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:15.260
to be the parents of Mingzhu
instead of me and Xu Dacheng.

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:18.180
Besides, Mingzhu is all grown up.

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:20.060
And, she has her own family now.

00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:21.620
Therefore, we...

00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:23.140
It doesn't matter

00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:25.140
if we acknowledge her again or not.

00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:26.260
Don't you agree?

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:28.620
Therefore, this is my opinion.

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:31.420
In the future,
I won't bring up anything related

00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:33.580
to acknowledging her
as my daughter again.

00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:35.020
Am I right? Besides,

00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:36.700
now, I know

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:37.860
that I have a daughter

00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:39.340
who's still alive.

00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:40.420
And, she's leading a good life too.

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:42.180
You guys are taking great care of her.

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:44.340
I don't need to be worried at all.

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:45.260
Am I right?

00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:46.780
I can rest at ease.

00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:49.660
So, what do you guys think?

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:54.140
Why are you looking at me?

00:28:58.260 --> 00:28:58.860
Sure.

00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:00.660
Come inside. Here.

00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:02.020
We shouldn't talk here.

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:02.580
But I...

00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:03.650
Hurry, please come inside.

00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:05.020
Come inside.

00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:05.660
Okay.

00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:08.060
Where will they
be holding their wedding?

00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:10.180
At Nanxi Hotel.

00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:10.860
Nanxi Hotel?

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:11.960
That's right. Nanxi Hotel.

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:13.620
Isn't that the hotel
Mingzhu is working in?

00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:15.780
That's right.
It'll be included in Mingzhu's KPI.

00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:18.940
That's great to hear.

00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:21.020
Have a seat. Here.

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:23.540
Please don't.

00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:24.580
Sitting here is fine.

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:25.620
Have a seat.

00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:26.980
No. I'll sit here.

00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:28.100
This place is fine.

00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:37.660
Xiu'e,

00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:40.260
so...

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:42.100
I hope you'll stop being mad at me.

00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:44.180
If you're still mad at me,

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:46.020
you can come at me.

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:47.860
You can hit me
or tell me off all you like.

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:49.220
I only managed to recover

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:51.060
all thanks
to the chicken soup you made for me

00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:52.140
anyway.

00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:54.220
If you don't mind it,

00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:57.140
from now on,
I'll be a part of your family.

00:29:58.020 --> 00:29:58.660
Forget it.

00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:00.300
Don't flatter me like that.

00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:01.220
I can't stand it.

00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:03.620
I was just sharing some warmth with you.

00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:05.220
There's a blind old woman next door

00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:07.220
who has no children.

00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:09.020
We often deliver
chicken soup to her too.

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:10.540
You...

00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:11.660
Please don't trouble yourself.

00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:12.900
Have some water.

00:30:12.910 --> 00:30:13.380
Please don't.

00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:14.260
Hey...

00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:16.780
Listen,

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:18.500
you were just discharged not long ago.

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:21.620
And, your son is getting married.

00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:22.820
You have to look after your body.

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:24.120
- If not...
- She's right.

00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:25.180
- You have to look after yourself.
- Yeah.

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:27.700
Xiu'e, you're right.

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:29.380
How could you be this kind?

00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:30.980
To be honest, you're truly kind.

00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:34.300
You and your entire family are kind.

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:35.660
You guys are so nice.

00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:36.940
Don't say that.

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:37.820
Hey.

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:39.340
It's almost lunchtime.

00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:40.620
You should stay for lunch.

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:41.980
I'll tell Shen
to make something good for you.

00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:42.620
Yeah.

00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:43.460
Yeah, join us for lunch.

00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:44.700
No thanks.

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:45.780
You guys are busy enough here.

00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:47.060
I mustn't cause
additional trouble for you two.

00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:47.700
I shouldn't.

00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:48.900
Shen is a great cook.

00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:50.420
It's fine. I'll make something for you.

00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:51.620
Just join us for lunch.

00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:52.340
That's not it.

00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:54.340
You see, I have plenty of
family matters to deal with.

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:56.340
I have to finish them.

00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:56.980
So...

00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:01.460
Please attend the wedding.

00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:03.140
Sure. We'll be there.

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:04.820
Yeah, we'll be there.

00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:08.220
Okay.

00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:09.780
Are you sure you don't want to join us?

00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:10.940
Yeah.

00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:12.620
Alright, then.

00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:13.980
Okay, I'll make a move first.

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:14.820
Take care.

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:17.580
She must be mentally sick.

00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:18.740
She was crying one minute
and laughing the next.

00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:19.540
I'm speechless.

00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:22.020
I'm so muddle-headed.

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:25.060
I almost brought back
the wedding candies with me.

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:28.100
Please attend their wedding.

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:29.460
Please.

00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:29.980
We shall.

00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:31.940
Alright. Thank you.

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:33.660
I'll thank you guys in advance.

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:35.020
I'll be going now.

00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:35.780
Take care.

00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:36.220
Alright.

00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:37.020
Take care.

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:43.170
My goodness.

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:47.980
Did she receive the wrong blood type?

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:48.930
Was that why she was acting weird?

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:49.700
How dare you still laugh?

00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:50.660
She was acting abnormally.

00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:52.460
How could you still laugh?

00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:53.580
You actually laughed, huh?

00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:54.780
You're something else.

00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:56.620
Why would you stop
a guest at the entrance?

00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:57.620
Nobody does that.

00:31:57.620 --> 00:31:58.780
She...

00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:00.680
I invited her to
join us for lunch, didn't I?

00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:03.180
No one does it like that.

00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:13.900
You see, I think Yu Jingxiang

00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:15.580
is quite pitiful.

00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:19.180
You see, she just hoped

00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:21.100
that Mingzhu could call her Mom.

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:23.540
Is that too much for you?

00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:25.100
What if it were you?

00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:28.820
What if you were in her shoes?

00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:29.920
What would you think?

00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:32.100
She was already feeling down.

00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:33.380
Even so, she humbled herself.

00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:35.700
She nodded and bowed to us.

00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:38.260
Even I thought that she was pitiful.

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.100
Did you think Mingzhu

00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:41.860
would've wanted that to happen?

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:43.660
Besides, she has evidence.

00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:48.060
She has plenty of evidence to prove

00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:49.540
that Mingzhu is her daughter.

00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:52.220
That's the reality.

00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:53.420
It's been so many years.

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:55.580
There are some things
you should let go of.

00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:57.540
You have to face reality
when you should.

00:32:57.660 --> 00:32:59.500
You should let go of the past

00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:00.500
when you have to.

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:01.860
Even she can figure that out.

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:03.060
If we don't,

00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:04.860
we'll be insensible, you know?

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:06.820
I mean,

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:08.900
Mingzhu knows
the situation all too well.

00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:10.900
She doesn't want both families

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:13.420
to fight for her

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:16.180
and be at odds forever.

00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:21.460
To help others is to help ourselves.

00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:23.140
The main thing is,

00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:27.460
you'll be helping
our daughter out as well.

00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:35.740
(Auspiciousness)

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:39.580
(Bliss)

00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:41.540
Class monitor!

00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:42.700
Hello, guys!

00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:44.420
- You guys are late.
- Congratulations.

00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:45.900
Thank you so much.

00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:47.300
Hurry and take a picture for us.

00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:48.140
- Let's take a picture.
- Come.

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:49.460
Look here. Get ready.

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:51.140
Look here. Three, two, one.

00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:51.820
One more.

00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:52.460
Over here.

00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:53.620
Here. Smile. Look at me.

00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:55.460
Here. Three, two, one.

00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:56.620
Excellent.

00:33:57.060 --> 00:33:57.820
Wait.

00:33:57.820 --> 00:33:58.940
Let me record a video
and post it in my Moments.

00:33:58.940 --> 00:33:59.780
Okay.

00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:01.260
On the count of three,
say "Happy wedding".

00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:01.780
Okay.

00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:03.940
Come. Three, two, one.

00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:06.620
- Happy wedding!
- Happy wedding!

00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:09.580
Dear aunts, you two looked phenomenal!

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:10.380
Uncle.

00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:12.620
Enjoy yourselves later, okay?

00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:13.900
This liquor is pretty good.

00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:16.060
Wait.

00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:17.420
What are you two doing?

00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:21.100
Your daughter insists on experiencing
what it feels like to get married.

00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:23.460
You think I don't want to experience
the feeling of getting married again?

00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:24.700
Hurry and get down.

00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:26.380
Be careful. Over here.

00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:27.930
Please head inside.

00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:29.100
- Take care.
- Please head inside.

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:29.660
Alright.

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:31.420
This is nice.

00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:32.180
Mr. Shen.

00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:34.180
Welcome.

00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:36.380
Our VIPs have arrived.

00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:38.540
Our VIPs have arrived.

00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:39.420
Congratulations.

00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:40.180
Thank you so much.

00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:40.820
Congratulations.

00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:41.980
Thank you, Mrs. Shen.

00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:42.620
Don't do it.

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:43.460
This is from me.

00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:44.300
Don't do it.

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:45.180
- This won't do.
- Mingzhu.

00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:46.140
I already have my own family.

00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:47.330
I should contribute one as well.

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:48.420
They shouldn't give us twice.

00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:49.900
Listen to me.

00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:52.060
We're already happy enough
that you guys are here.

00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:53.260
We're a family. Don't do this.

00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:54.420
Stop being stubborn.

00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:55.260
It's not for you anyway.

00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:56.180
Congratulations.

00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:57.900
Thank you, Mrs. Shen.

00:34:57.900 --> 00:34:58.700
Thank you, Mingzhu.

00:34:58.710 --> 00:34:59.900
You two must stay happy, okay?

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:01.060
May you have a child soon.

00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:01.820
Thank you so much.

00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:03.940
So, where's the toilet?

00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:05.340
It's over there.

00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:06.540
- I need to use the toilet.
- Mom, I'll join you.

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:07.500
I'll be fine. You can stay here.

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:08.180
I'll be back in a second.

00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:09.380
I drank too much water just now.

00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:10.340
I need to take a leak.

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:11.700
Take care.

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:14.820
Mingzhu, you're here.

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:16.020
Zhixia.

00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:16.860
Mingzhu.

00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:18.340
You're so beautiful.

00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:19.860
Mr. Shen.

00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:22.260
We're truly honored by your presence.

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:23.620
Didn't Mrs. Shen come as well?

00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:24.420
She's here.

00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:25.460
She went to the toilet.

00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:26.490
Is your younger brother
in the toilet too?

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:27.100
No.

00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:28.950
He's studying at home
to prepare for the NCEE.

00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:30.300
- Mingzhu.
- That's good to hear.

00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:32.180
How are you doing?

00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:33.060
I'm doing great.

00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:34.220
It's just that my child
is growing rapidly.

00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:35.140
Isn't that great? Look at me.

00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:36.140
Yeah.

00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:37.700
Oh yeah.

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:39.020
Photographer, please help us

00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:40.700
take a family picture.

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:41.860
- Yeah.
- I'll go and look for Mom.

00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:43.620
Mr. Shen, come and join us.

00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:44.860
No. I'll go and look for her.

00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:45.260
You?

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:46.130
Take the family picture.

00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:46.580
Let's take one first.

00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:47.220
You guys can go ahead.

00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:48.460
Alright. We'll take one first.

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:49.460
Okay. Come.

00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:51.020
Okay. Come here, dear.

00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:52.460
Look at me.

00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:54.180
Look at me.

00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:55.580
Three, two, one.

00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:56.140
Cheese.

00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:57.300
I'm the only one doing it.

00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:57.860
Come on, let's do it.

00:35:57.860 --> 00:35:59.180
Okay.

00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:00.060
Let's take one more. Smile.

00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:01.900
It's a family picture. Three, two, one.

00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:03.940
- Cheese!
- Cheese!

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:05.100
Alright.

00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:06.100
Okay.

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:06.660
Hey.

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:06.980
Mom.

00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:07.900
That doesn't count.

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:09.420
Mom, let's take a family picture.

00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:10.180
Yeah.

00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:11.820
They're taking a family picture.

00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:12.580
Yeah.

00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:14.100
We aren't a family.
Why are we joining them?

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:14.860
Mrs. Shen.

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:17.300
Join us for a family picture.

00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:18.900
It's okay.

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:19.850
The auspicious hour is nearing.

00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:21.820
Friends and family,
please take your seats.

00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:22.220
Yeah.

00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:23.860
It's almost time.
We should proceed first.

00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:24.900
We can talk about the photo later.

00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:25.700
Let's observe the ceremony first.

00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:26.380
Was she upset?

00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:26.700
No.

00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:28.580
We reserved the VIP seats for you all.

00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:30.180
Please take your seats.

00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:32.140
Come. Please take your seats.

00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:40.550
The bride's father is
holding his daughter's hands,

00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:43.300
from her first day of school
to her wedding day...

00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:53.100
(Just a few months ago,)

00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:56.020
(I've imagined this scene
countless times.)

00:36:56.740 --> 00:36:59.100
(I discussed
how I should walk the aisle)

00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:01.980
(with my father
on my wedding day countless times.)

00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:03.100
(I pondered how to smile)

00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:05.260
(or how I should extend my arm
to my future husband.)

00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:06.700
(But now,)

00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:08.940
(my husband is no longer around.)

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:25.020
Let's take a breather outside.

00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:26.340
Mom, I'm fine.

00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:28.020
I'm just touched

00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:29.300
that they're getting married.

00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:30.700
I'm fine.

00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:32.260
Look.

00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:33.180
Groom,

00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:35.580
you may come and embrace happiness now.

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:45.980
I know that the bride's father

00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:47.860
must be reluctant to part with her.

00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:49.260
But at this moment,

00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:51.500
you still have
a sacred mission to complete.

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:53.460
Please give
your precious daughter, Bichen,

00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:55.380
into the care of her groom,
Mr. Xu Zhidong,

00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:57.980
to complete the passing
and continuation of love.

00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:15.620
Bride's father, please open your arms

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:17.380
and embrace the newlywed.

00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:35.020
Sorry about this.

00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:36.420
Host,

00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:38.380
actually, it's not time

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:40.020
for my speech yet.

00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:43.220
You see, I already prepared a script

00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:44.180
for my speech.

00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:45.500
But now,

00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:47.820
I'm suddenly inspired.

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:51.020
I wish to say something
to everyone here.

00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:57.180
The pictures of us

00:38:57.180 --> 00:38:58.660
on the screen

00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:01.540
were all happy and joyous moments.

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:04.020
But that isn't all.

00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:07.780
We do have misunderstandings, conflicts,

00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:10.260
and arguments too.

00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:13.580
But just like what everyone says,

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:16.220
it's precisely
because of these disappointments

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:17.820
and these moments of happiness

00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:20.140
that we become whole.

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:22.540
With these disappointments,

00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:25.280
the moments of happiness
become extra precious.

00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:26.820
With these disappointments,

00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:28.820
Chen and I were able to

00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:31.340
understand and trust each other more.

00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:35.540
With these disappointments,

00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:40.340
I was truly able
to understand the meaning of home.

00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:46.940
Though great kindness
need not be thanked,

00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:52.020
Dad, Mom,

00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:55.380
and Zhixia,

00:39:57.340 --> 00:39:58.740
thank you for your love.

00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:03.140
I will use the rest of my life
to repay your kindness.

00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:05.500
Thank you.

00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:21.180
From today onward, Chen and I

00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:22.660
will also establish our own family.

00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:24.780
I have something to tell Chen.

00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:28.220
Chen,

00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:30.820
you have to be mentally prepared.

00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:33.340
Today might be the most wonderful day

00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:34.780
of your life.

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:37.340
After this, you will face
a ten-month pregnancy.

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:39.950
You will give birth to our children,
and you have to raise them.

00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:41.020
You will gain weight,

00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:42.140
you will get stretch marks,

00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:44.750
and you will be so busy that
you have no time to doll yourself up.

00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:48.020
No. What I'm trying to say is

00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:50.140
that you're always be beautiful to me!

00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:53.260
I wish to say this to you.

00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:56.380
Thank you so much
for everything you did.

00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:03.460
Today,
I will announce this to the world!

00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:05.020
Yuan Bichen,

00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:06.540
I love you!

00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:08.860
Excellent!

00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:10.340
Excellent!

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.580
There's one more person I need to thank.

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:26.540
Without her,

00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:29.060
our child wouldn't have survived.

00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:31.140
And, we wouldn't be standing here.

00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:33.340
I need to thank my second sister,

00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:35.420
Shen Mingzhu.

00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:37.620
You didn't need to.

00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:39.260
Mingzhu,

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:41.660
no matter if you acknowledge me
as your brother or not,

00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:43.020
to me,

00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:44.500
we are twins,

00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:45.860
who are bound by blood.

00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:47.740
Please come on stage

00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:49.100
and be our officiant.

00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:50.540
Please give us a speech.

00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:52.060
What's going on?

00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:53.700
What did he mean by that?

00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:55.820
I thought they said
that they would drop the matter.

00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:59.060
It's obvious that they're trying
to acknowledge you through this wedding.

00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:03.260
The groom's speech was truly touching.

00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:06.300
And, Mingzhu
is her parents' precious daughter.

00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:08.940
She's also the guiding pearl
for our newlywed couple.

00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:11.180
Since she's very important,

00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:13.530
and she wants to give her blessings
to the newlywed couple,

00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:14.100
here,

00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:16.420
I would like to make a request.

00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:17.700
Everyone knows

00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:19.580
that Mingzhu is an excellent pianist.

00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:21.220
Action speaks louder than words.

00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:23.340
Next, let us give a big hand

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:24.900
to Mrs. Shen Mingzhu.

00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:26.020
Please play a song for us,

00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:26.660
okay?

00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:29.500
Excellent!

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:34.540
Why are you sitting down?

00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:35.460
What did I tell you?

00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:36.420
We shouldn't have come here
in the first place!

00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:38.500
They're in the middle of their wedding.

00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:39.100
For this moment...

00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:40.700
But he did it on purpose!
