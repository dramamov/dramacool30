00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:40.200
So, in that case,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.520
Chu Yao really didn't die.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.040
It was Zhang Guifen who saved her.

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:44.040
And then,

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.560
Chu Yao and Zhang Guifen disguised
themselves as ghosts to get revenge.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.840
But Zhang Guifen died again
to save Chu Yao.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:49.799
What about Chu Yao?

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.919
No, I can't...

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.520
I'm about to faint.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.000
In all this,

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:56.439
there must be more to the story.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.439
Only by finding Chu Yao
can we figure it out.

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:01.560
So where do we look?

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:03.360
There's someone who knows.

00:01:08.199 --> 00:01:08.680
You all...

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.080
Why are you up?

00:01:11.199 --> 00:01:12.199
Your wound hasn't healed yet.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.239
Miss He,

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.199
what are you doing?

00:01:19.919 --> 00:01:21.480
Chu Yao was shot.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.760
Trauma medicine won't help at all.

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:25.199
If she doesn't get proper treatment,

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.120
she might lose her arm.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.360
Is it Aman?

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.360
It's me.

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:54.319
The village chief and Hei Ye—

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:55.519
I did it all by myself.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.680
Aman didn't know.

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:02.319
I only found out later

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:04.400
that Chu Yao was buried alive by them.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.440
At midnight,

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:08.479
I snuck over there alone.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:09.639
I wanted to burn paper for Chu Yao.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.039
But I actually heard

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.080
sounds coming from underground.

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:22.119
Help!

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:26.160
Help!

00:02:28.279 --> 00:02:30.080
Help!

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:32.399
Help!

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:34.199
Help!

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:36.320
Help!

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:38.440
Was it Chu Yao?

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:41.759
It wasn't hard to pry open the coffin.

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:43.399
There were

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:45.199
seven nails on the coffin.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.639
Two of them were odd.

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:48.160
They didn't seem nailed in at all.

00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:51.279
There were copper coins wedged upright.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.080
The lid wasn't sealed, there was a gap.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.800
That's how Chu Yao lasted
a few more hours.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.399
When I got her out,

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.600
I was in a rush, didn't think much.

00:03:01.279 --> 00:03:02.240
But looking back now,

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:05.000
those oddities on the coffin

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:06.759
weren't a coincidence.

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:08.679
Definitely not.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.520
You must have realized—

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:12.759
your mother left those for you.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.880
She wanted to secretly save you.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.000
But your father found out.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.240
He knocked her out and tied her up
for two days.

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:22.080
After that, she thought you were dead.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.520
No.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.000
She knew I was alive all along.

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:30.479
The day I killed the village chief,

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:32.360
I planned to run away.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.919
But unexpectedly,

00:03:34.279 --> 00:03:35.399
I ran into her.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.080
I thought

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.119
killing the chief would be exposed.

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:48.919
But after two days,

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:50.320
Aman told me

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.119
the rumor was a vengeful ghost
did the killing.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.240
The day she saw you,

00:03:59.559 --> 00:04:01.479
your mother knew you wanted revenge.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.320
She was afraid you'd be discovered.

00:04:03.399 --> 00:04:06.520
So she spread rumors about
a murderous ghost.

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:08.800
She even made

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.679
a dress just like your red ritual robe.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.800
So that, if needed,

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.679
she could do things in your place.

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.759
Like with the village chief—

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.279
that day,

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:18.480
he probably wasn't dead yet.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.079
Your mother finished him off for you.

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:23.119
And in the end, to help you escape,

00:04:23.559 --> 00:04:25.880
she was killed by the Heifeng Cult leader.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.399
Yaoyao...

00:04:28.679 --> 00:04:29.440
Run!

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:36.799
But why?

00:04:37.399 --> 00:04:38.440
For as long as I remember,

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.160
she always obeyed my father.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.000
Even when I had a fever and needed a doctor,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.640
she had to kneel and beg him
for three days.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.480
She ignored my pleas

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.920
and became a puppet of the Heifeng Cult.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.920
She watched coldly

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.119
as I was treated as a hated demon.

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:54.079
She even watched me get buried alive.

00:04:55.119 --> 00:04:56.079
Now, after all this,

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:57.600
why?

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:59.959
Why did she do all that?

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.279
Because, like many others,

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:04.920
she was conditioned from birth.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.920
Enslaved and exploited.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.839
Her environment doomed her
to be timid and ignorant,

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:12.000
even numb.

00:05:13.079 --> 00:05:14.679
So your expectations of her

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.839
were too much for her.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.640
But even such a timid, ignorant,

00:05:19.679 --> 00:05:21.000
even numb woman,

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.600
for her daughter,

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.600
for the first time in her life,

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.679
she defied her husband,
who was like a god to her,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.440
and her faith, sacred as heaven.

00:05:31.519 --> 00:05:32.559
I don't understand.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.040
I truly don't understand.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.679
Before she died, your mother
left two symbols.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.040
They're here too.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.880
Do you recognize them?

00:05:58.079 --> 00:06:00.000
This upward triangle

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.160
means "go."

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.760
It means "go."

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:14.839
Downward means "come back."

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:17.119
This circle

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.040
means

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:20.000
"eat."

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.320
This square means "sleep."

00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:26.239
This one...

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:27.359
And this one?

00:06:28.079 --> 00:06:29.279
It means "I miss you."

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.920
And this one?

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:35.799
This one...

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:37.839
means "I'm sorry."

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:40.760
This flower—

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.760
Why does it mean "I'm sorry"?

00:06:44.679 --> 00:06:46.760
Because every time I did something wrong,

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.119
I'd pick a flower for my mother,

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.279
and she'd forgive me.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:13.959
The ones my mother left—

00:07:14.559 --> 00:07:15.920
which two symbols were they?

00:07:30.679 --> 00:07:32.239
Yaoyao...

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.079
Mother misses you.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.839
I'm sorry.

00:07:45.679 --> 00:07:46.600
Mother.

00:07:58.239 --> 00:08:00.279
Heifeng Cult followers and remnants

00:08:00.279 --> 00:08:01.640
have all been sent to the county office.

00:08:02.279 --> 00:08:03.640
The two of us plan to keep watch.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.679
In case those fools let someone escape again.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.079
I've been invited to travel to Tianjin.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.559
So I can't go with you this time.

00:08:13.279 --> 00:08:14.399
Even before I left,

00:08:14.399 --> 00:08:16.679
I still hadn't received Zhang Guifen's
Spirit Aura.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.000
That shouldn't be.

00:08:18.519 --> 00:08:20.399
The symbols she left before dying

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.239
each represented

00:08:21.239 --> 00:08:23.160
her longing and guilt for Chu Yao.

00:08:23.559 --> 00:08:24.959
The hidden meaning

00:08:25.119 --> 00:08:26.679
was simply wishing her peace, right?

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.399
Now that we've eliminated Heifeng Cult,

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.119
isn't she already safe?

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.880
Chu Yao's murder case hasn't been tried yet.

00:08:35.239 --> 00:08:36.559
Though her actions are understandable,

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:38.880
she still broke Qing law.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.840
Even with leniency,

00:08:41.239 --> 00:08:42.679
there will be a price to pay.

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:44.400
Maybe for Zhang Guifen,

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.640
this isn't the peace she wished for.

00:08:47.599 --> 00:08:50.359
Nothing is more complex than the human heart.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.880
Especially the wishes of the dying.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.599
How could we easily understand them?

00:08:59.799 --> 00:09:00.359
Remember,

00:09:01.119 --> 00:09:02.479
the External Elixir is only a support.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:03.679
Normally,

00:09:04.119 --> 00:09:05.799
you must cultivate your Internal Elixir.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.799
Six stars of the Big Dipper in the Lamp
are lit.

00:09:09.039 --> 00:09:10.000
No matter what,

00:09:10.119 --> 00:09:11.799
the last one will light up soon.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.440
We must be patient.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.440
I understand, Master.

00:09:15.799 --> 00:09:16.880
Be careful on your journey.

00:09:19.719 --> 00:09:21.559
The world is growing more chaotic.

00:09:21.799 --> 00:09:23.559
Corpses of the starved line the roads.

00:09:23.719 --> 00:09:24.880
The dead are everywhere.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.239
Collecting Spirit Aura is important,

00:09:27.599 --> 00:09:29.200
but you must stay cautious.

00:09:30.039 --> 00:09:31.000
Like this time—

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.520
if I hadn't been here,

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:35.280
Prince might've been fatally poisoned.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:38.760
Don't worry.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.039
On this journey,

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.080
Miss He and Aqi were lucky
Prince helped.

00:09:44.799 --> 00:09:47.559
But there's one more thing
I'd like to ask.

00:09:49.239 --> 00:09:49.760
Sure.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.320
I heard from Miss He

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.760
that Prince has clues about those

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.799
who massacred Zhenhuan Biaoju
ten years ago.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.479
Back then, they were hunting

00:10:01.479 --> 00:10:03.200
the Imperial Guard protecting
the Seven Stars Lamp.

00:10:03.239 --> 00:10:04.679
That's how they found Zhenhuan Biaoju.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.760
Though the Seven Stars Lamp is a treasure,

00:10:08.159 --> 00:10:09.039
in this world,

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:11.400
who dares to steal from the Empress Dowager?

00:10:12.119 --> 00:10:12.960
Besides,

00:10:13.599 --> 00:10:16.359
when Miss He vanished with the Lamp,

00:10:16.559 --> 00:10:17.760
they stopped searching for it.

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:19.200
So it seems

00:10:19.599 --> 00:10:21.960
their goal wasn't the treasure.

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.719
They just didn't want the Empress Dowager
to succeed.

00:10:25.799 --> 00:10:26.400
That's right.

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:28.719
We guessed the same before.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:32.719
Many want to harm the Empress Dowager.

00:10:33.479 --> 00:10:34.840
But ten years ago,

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:37.359
only the Lan Hai Society

00:10:37.719 --> 00:10:38.679
were truly mad.

00:10:42.039 --> 00:10:43.280
Prince himself

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:45.840
is even more decisive than he appears.

00:10:46.359 --> 00:10:47.679
He acts swiftly and firmly.

00:10:48.599 --> 00:10:50.880
But that's not what I want to ask.

00:10:55.799 --> 00:10:56.919
You've seen it too—

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:58.840
Miss He is naturally indifferent.

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.599
She doesn't understand emotions well.

00:11:01.359 --> 00:11:03.080
So she might not realize

00:11:03.719 --> 00:11:04.960
Prince has

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.919
special feelings for her.

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:10.679
Keep your voice down.

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:11.679
You—

00:11:11.679 --> 00:11:13.320
You haven't told her, right?

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:15.320
You've only known her a few days.

00:11:15.559 --> 00:11:17.919
Plus, the Seven Stars Lamp
complicates things.

00:11:18.679 --> 00:11:20.919
Now you act this way—

00:11:21.599 --> 00:11:22.840
do you think I'd believe

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.479
you have no other motives?

00:11:28.359 --> 00:11:28.880
Indeed.

00:11:29.559 --> 00:11:30.960
This isn't my first time

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:32.400
meeting Miss He.

00:11:36.919 --> 00:11:37.679
There—

00:11:38.919 --> 00:11:40.880
The person in the dream
was really him.

00:11:41.479 --> 00:11:42.000
That's right.

00:11:42.039 --> 00:11:44.679
This is the first Seven Stars dream
you've caught.

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.200
If you solve the dream,

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.919
fulfill his final wish,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.599
you'll collect the Spirit Aura.

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.280
But what should we do?

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:58.520
Still haven't figured it out?

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.239
He's almost dead.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.280
Forget it, I can't think of anything.

00:12:13.239 --> 00:12:14.119
Miss He.

00:12:14.239 --> 00:12:16.679
You and I are now
closely connected.

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:18.159
Your blood is precious.

00:12:18.479 --> 00:12:19.479
He still has a breath left.

00:12:19.599 --> 00:12:21.960
My blood can keep him alive
for a while.

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.119
Prince.

00:12:36.239 --> 00:12:37.359
Prince, where are you?

00:12:37.359 --> 00:12:38.320
Aqi, someone's here.

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.080
He Fu Yi from Zhenhuan Biaoju.

00:12:43.159 --> 00:12:44.320
Entrusted by another,

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.039
here to collect Liu Chunru's body.

00:12:52.799 --> 00:12:58.200
He Fu Yi.
