Apparently, they spent 1,000,000 dollars...

just on construction for the merger.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.690
Does that make any sense?

What's his deal?

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:16.630
He's just trying to pick a fight.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:19.400
You know he's been pissed at the Emergency Committee.

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.200
The department's reputation was already bad...

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:22.830
because of that forced merger,

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:24.900
and now that all the internal issues keep leaking outside,

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:27.140
they're saying the school's image is totally ruined.

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:30.170
Still, that's no excuse.

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.410
Hey, they're graduating soon, too.

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:34.580
It's prime time for job hunting,

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:35.850
so of course they're on edge.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.450
Aren't you graduating after the summer semester too?

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.150
Yes, but I've already got a job lined up.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.389
Really? Congratulations!

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:45.860
It's not a company in Seoul or anything.

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:47.659
Anyway, everyone's busy...

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:49.630
worrying about their own future, around this time.

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.430
So don't let Everytime get to you, okay?

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:55.970
Yes, people post anything on there.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.100
They nitpick your private life,

00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:59.470
or your orientation, stuff like that.

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:09.150
Hey.

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:11.050
Hey.

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:19.960
That story you posted yesterday...

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:22.560
was that near campus?

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:24.130
Yesterday?

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:26.500
Oh, yes.

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:28.330
It's nearby. The vibe was great.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.630
The yakitori was great, too.

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:33.600
- Is he trying to fish for details? - Yakitori?

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.040
You mean those chicken skewers with the green onions?

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:38.140
Just chicken skewers.

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:39.410
Scallion skewers are sold separately.

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:43.650
Am I overthinking this? Maybe Gil Tan's already out?

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:44.850
Did you guys go for a second round?

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:46.620
Yes.

00:10:46.621 --> 00:10:48.890
But it's not just a place for friends.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.390
But we are friends. At least, I thought so.

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:55.590
Darn it.

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:56.590
Here, let me try.

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:00.400
There were no staples.

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:01.800
No wonder it wouldn't budge.

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:04.800
There you go. Do you want me to get that one too?

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:06.170
I'm good.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:08.240
And just like that, I've got butterflies.

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:17.820
Do you want to go together sometime?

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:20.280
For yakitori.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.120
Sure.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:24.890
The ginkgo skewers were great, too.

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:27.120
Let's go when we both have time.

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:28.460
Yes.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.830
It's not a place for friends.

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:33.860
I'm heading out.

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:35.069
Okay, bye.

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:38.370
(Department of Converged Physical Technology and Global Contents)

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.509
Now, where is it? Let's see where it is.

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:44.510
Dad, what are you doing?

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.880
I was just looking for a pot.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:48.280
A pot?

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:52.180
I forgot.

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:56.320
I don't have a pot. Don't worry about making food.

00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:58.620
It's right here.

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:00.319
So there is one.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.490
Since when?

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:03.630
So that's all you needed, right?

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:05.200
- No, but... - Dad!

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:06.530
What?

00:12:06.531 --> 00:12:08.129
Just look at all this dust.

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:11.070
After you leave for school, I'm turning this place upside down.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:12.370
It doesn't need cleaning.

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:13.769
Look at it with your own two eyes.

00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:15.369
This place is an absolute dust pit.

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:17.410
Fine. Then you can clean it for me, Dad.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.880
- You want me to clean it? - The bathroom.

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:22.410
You've got some nerve.

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:25.020
Just because I own a motel...

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:26.520
doesn't mean I'm your personal maid.

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:27.820
That's not it.

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:30.149
- I saw a cockroach. - What?

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:31.689
- There is. - I didn't see one.

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:33.860
There is one. It's still hiding over there.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.029
I'm positive. There are a few of them!

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:36.030
- Is that so? - Yes.

00:12:36.031 --> 00:12:37.860
- Hurry! - Where is this supposed cockroach?

00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:40.630
- Let me see. - Why would you send this to me!

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:46.600
Where is this cockroach you're talking about?

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:47.940
What, you can't see it?

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:49.840
It was huge.

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:51.610
"It was huge?"

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:53.210
How many of them?

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:57.250
Didn't it come in from outside?

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:01.250
- Get inside. - Where is it?

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:04.560
Where is it?

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:06.889
Maybe it left the bathroom.

00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:07.929
I can't find it.

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:09.660
Yes, maybe it left!

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:11.260
Weren't you just half-asleep?

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:12.330
Yes.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:13.500
What?

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:15.070
I guess so.

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:17.539
- I'm late, I'm heading to school. - What about breakfast?

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:18.540
You can eat by yourself, Dad.

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:21.170
- Eat something! - I'll just have a banana!

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:22.670
You need to eat a proper meal!

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:29.349
How am I going to deliver all this?

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:30.950
(Department Jacket Order Sheet)

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:37.290
Are you heading to class already?

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:38.890
Is it the one that ends at four?

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:40.789
Yes. You?

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:41.790
Me too, four.

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:43.530
I planned my schedule around yours.

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:45.300
Aren't you going to be late?

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:46.930
It's fine if I'm a little late.

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:51.440
You'd better get going. I'm taking off.

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:52.870
Oh, right.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:54.670
I have to return the department jacket.

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:56.810
Sorry?

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:58.639
It looked so good so I wore it to class,

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:00.110
but I think I left it there.

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:03.010
Sorry.

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:04.450
I'll get it to you later.

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.950
All right. I'll see you later.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.160
Such a nice day

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.169
Such a nice watch

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:25.170
Heading to pilates

00:14:25.171 --> 00:14:26.600
A direct message from Jinny?

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:28.770
Min Hak,

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:30.870
you're not buying their story, are you?

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:34.949
What kind of day should I have

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:38.820
(Min Hak, you're not buying their story, are you?)

00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:40.680
Look, there's that girl again.

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:46.320
- Hey, I'm getting off here. - Right here?

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:49.830
Wait, why are you getting off here?

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:52.560
Hey.

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:59.400
Walk over to the locker as naturally as possible,

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:02.710
casually open the bag,

00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:07.909
then naturally open the locker door and shove this monstrosity inside.

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:09.310
Gosh, this locker is full.

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:13.980
I can't believe I brought this all the way to school.

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.700
San, you dropped...

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:32.299
(Joo Yeon San)

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:34.040
It's heavier than I expected.

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:38.110
Because it holds San's food for the day, a banana.

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:41.810
I spent the whole night lost in my own emotions,

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:45.850
I wonder what kind of weight must San bear,

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:49.350
living on the same Earth with dull people like me?

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:53.120
Sea squirt larvae are like tadpoles.

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:54.560
They swim around freely.

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:55.730
Surprising, isn't it?

00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:59.930
When a sea squirt becomes an adult, it attaches firmly to a rock...

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.970
and within 48 hours, it eats its own nervous system and spinal cord.

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:07.400
Once it no longer needs to move,

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:09.870
the brain becomes unnecessary too.

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:13.540
Doesn't that sound like some people in high places around here?

00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:16.810
There she goes, on another tangent unrelated to our major.

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:22.920
Essentially, every brain is an organ that creates movement.

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:25.590
From a human's view, you'd think it's just for thought.

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:29.330
But it's not an organ that only thinks.

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.270
Plants, which don't move,

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:39.840
therefore have no brain or nerves.

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:44.139
Of course, the secretion of hormones from the tip of the plant embryo...

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:47.010
could be seen as a kind of movement, I suppose.

00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:49.010
Hormones.

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:52.550
But the kind of movement I'm referring to here...

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:55.320
is a more vivid form of interaction.

00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:57.860
A dance, if you will.

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:08.770
What's she doing?

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:10.970
Is she dancing?

00:17:11.570 --> 00:17:12.570
I think so.

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:14.540
So weird.

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:26.480
I kept calling your name earlier,

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:27.990
but you didn't hear me and just kept going.

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:29.790
Sorry?

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:31.420
Why were you calling me?

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:38.530
You dropped this.

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:47.770
You're something else.

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.810
It's a good thing I picked it up right away.

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:53.140
Wait. Don't tell me he opened it.

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:55.350
Does he know what this is or not?

00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:56.710
Therefore,

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:59.950
the notion that plants can listen to music is absurd.

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:02.290
The very definition of "hearing"...

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:05.119
requires the existence of neurons,

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:07.160
which only animals possess.

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:12.930
Man, global warming is no joke.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.930
It's only March, why is it so hot?

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:19.240
Now where's the remote?

00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:34.750
Which brings us to...

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:39.560
the "Sonic Algorithm to Promote Houseplant Growth."

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:43.730
I'm rejecting this app proposal, Mr. Ban Ji No.

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:46.460
What? That was Ban Ji No's idea?

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:49.269
- It wasn't even that great? - He did that whole dance for that?

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:50.400
Power on.

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:52.540
Starting in basic mode.

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:54.370
What's that sound?

00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:57.940
Why isn't this working?

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:09.320
I have to find the power button.

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:12.890
Why won't this zipper budge...

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:15.030
How do I turn this thing off...

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:19.660
- Darn it. - Since I am not a plant myself,

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:23.970
I can hear an unbalanced motor spinning.

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.740
- What's that noise? - Sounds like someone's phone is on.

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:29.670
Why isn't this working?

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:39.880
Everyone, please put your phones on silent.

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:44.250
Please.

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:47.960
Switching to Strong Vibrate Mode.

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:51.800
Be quiet, darn it.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:55.570
- Shut down. - Whose is it?

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:01.709
It keeps going off, it must be urgent.

00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:02.910
You should step out and take that.

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:13.720
Now playing Hot Guys' Moans Mode.

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:51.120
Gosh, what's that doing here?

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.500
The ridges are vibrating so coquettishly.

00:21:56.150 --> 00:21:57.190
That vibration.

00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:01.390
- What? - What's with her?

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:02.990
What the heck?

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:06.400
- Why would she bring that here? - Isn't that the "Do me" girl?

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:07.460
So?

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.400
She's kind of a troublemaker.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.100
This is wild. Why won't my phone record?

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:15.740
- She needs to put that away. - Seriously.

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:17.840
Stay calm, Joo Yeon San.

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:19.540
Man.

00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:22.180
Even in the worst situations, there's always a way out.

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:26.020
What a noise.

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:27.920
Hey.

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:33.219
Feynman won the Nobel Prize for an equation...

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:34.420
he came up with after watching a spinning plate.

00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:41.830
The people in this room are also members of the ivory tower.

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.840
If I just calmly explain everything, they'll understand.

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.170
I have to trust their intelligence and open-mindedness.

00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:52.640
- It's still on. - Should we really be filming this?

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:53.980
Why does she carry something so big around?

00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:02.390
That's all for today. You did a great job, sweetie.

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:08.560
I'm sure you're all a bit flustered.

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:12.800
You're probably thinking you've seen it all in this class.

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:18.070
But the fact it took me forever to find the power button,

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:23.870
should be enough to tell you that I'm new to this device.

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:25.709
That's right. I'm in the Department of Computer Engineering.

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:27.040
I do a lot of side jobs.

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:30.649
I was asked to check for a device syncing error,

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:33.480
and it's for a freelance gig I was subcontracted for.

00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:38.889
My father made a surprise visit,

00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:41.260
and I was worried he might find it.

00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:42.929
And get the wrong idea,

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:46.200
so I hid it in my bag.

00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:53.270
However, I still have no idea how it suddenly turned on.

00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:56.570
My best guess is...

00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:58.070
I see.

00:23:58.810 --> 00:24:01.280
So that's what that was earlier...

00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:07.520
Now that I've gone to such lengths to explain the situation,

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:13.220
please don't get the wrong idea or spread rumours.

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:17.690
Thank you for listening to my long-winded explanation.

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:21.399
- That's totally plausible. - Yes, that makes sense to me.

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:24.270
- Right. - Maybe there's still hope...

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.140
How can she do that?

00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:29.070
You shouldn't be recording this.

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:31.310
Come on, what about her privacy?

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:33.740
- Man. - Everyone.

00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:36.710
How about we all put our phones down?

00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:38.720
I don't think we need to record this.

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:41.450
Darn, I'm so done for.
