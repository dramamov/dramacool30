00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.950
Mr. Yu, have you already apologized?
That was quick.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.390
I have not gone yet.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.270
I need to revise a drawing right away.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.180
But I need to head to the site now.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.620
You handle the drawing.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.900
Send it to me once it is done.

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:28.390
Okay.

00:02:31.173 --> 00:02:33.140
- What is wrong?
- My computer will not turn on.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.299
What? How did that happen?

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.140
Come use mine.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.300
I need this drawing done soon.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.420
Come on.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.350
Alright, that works.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:51.110
Thanks for helping.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:52.630
Do your best.

- Goodbye.

Alright, I get it.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.140
Why are you sitting here
instead of going to apologize?

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:50.700
Mr. Sun.

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:54.230
Get up.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:55.900
This is for working.

00:04:10.706 --> 00:04:12.020
You are quite cooperative today.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.110
Why are you smiling like that?

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.030
What are you laughing at?
That smile is strange.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.940
Mr. Yu, I am sorry.

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:31.790
It was my fault.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:32.910
I misjudged you.

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:34.070
What is it?

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.940
(He is the real culprit!)

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:01.500
Well...

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.230
It was Sun who hit him.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.230
Mr. Yu, I am sorry.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.060
I blamed you for nothing.

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:14.180
Rise.

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.230
From now on, do you trust me or Wu?

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:23.710
Of course I trust you.

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.670
Mr. Yu, you are generous and forgiving.

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:28.180
Everything you say is right.

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.230
Sun should be the one apologizing.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.300
- Mr. Sun!
- Mr. Sun!

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.350
Forget it.

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:44.470
I will go.

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:48.940
But you were not the one who hit him.

00:05:49.351 --> 00:05:50.500
It is not really your place.

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:52.790
I am the designer.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:54.940
If someone on my team made a mistake,

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:56.790
it is my responsibility to fix it.

00:05:59.817 --> 00:06:01.500
You are apologizing for someone else...

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:03.710
Churchill once said

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.420
that taking responsibility for others

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.060
is an act of greatness.

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.380
Mr. Yu has grown.

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.260
You are starting to look like a leader.

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:17.590
Alright then.

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.990
I will go.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:20.140
Okay.

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.030
I am counting on you.

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:25.300
Bring a small gift when you go.

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.380
Even a watermelon would do.

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:31.300
You may all rise.

00:06:32.195 --> 00:06:33.017
I respectfully

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.640
- send off Your Majesty.
- Yes.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.030
You know Mr. Yu...

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.620
He is proud, but a little tsundere too.

00:06:56.106 --> 00:06:57.740
Do you think he can swallow his pride?

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:00.030
True.

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:04.500
How did a few words
get him so carried away?

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:32.060
Where is the boss?

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:32.940
Looking for the boss?

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:34.500
Boss, someone is looking for you.

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:35.830
Sir.

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:37.310
Where is he?

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:44.500
Dr. Gu, we are full. We are heading out.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:45.340
So soon?

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:50.380
Why are you skipping meals?

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:51.940
Where does it hurt this time?

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:54.060
My stomach hurts.

00:07:54.173 --> 00:07:55.728
Did you eat too much watermelon?

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:57.060
No. Someone made me angry.

00:07:57.817 --> 00:08:00.420
Who has that kind of power?
Made you so mad that your stomach hurts?

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:01.470
It hurts even more now.

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:03.820
Tell me what happened.

Look at this place.

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:11.670
It is this dumpling shop.

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:12.900
You have been there?

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:15.710
I...

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:17.420
I know the owner.

00:08:17.751 --> 00:08:18.940
Why are you showing me this?

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:23.300
I heard the food is great.

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:27.500
And it is fun.

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:30.500
And the prices are good.

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:33.110
You want to eat there, do you?

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.710
Eating dumplings alone
is boring and silly.

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:39.190
So you want me to go with you?

00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:41.430
Not really.

00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:45.110
But if you insist on coming with me,

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:46.900
I will not refuse.

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:09.190
Thank you for asking me out for a meal.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:11.260
I did not ask you out.

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:12.950
I am just keeping you company.

You are something else.

00:09:24.728 --> 00:09:25.910
Stop padding the board.

00:09:25.973 --> 00:09:27.862
You need the sound
to knead dough properly.

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:30.660
What kind of nonsense is that?

00:09:30.995 --> 00:09:32.430
It is the rhythm of good food.

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:33.710
The beat of life.

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:36.230
Think about when your family
made dough back then.

00:09:36.306 --> 00:09:38.190
The whole table
used to shake and bang, right?

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:41.540
That is true.

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:50.710

Go ahead.

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:15.660
What are you doing?

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:17.020
Making dough pieces.

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:18.380
What?

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:19.950
Dough pieces?

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:21.830
They become dumpling wrappers later.

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:25.310
Mr. Yu just kneaded
the flour into a dough.

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:27.780
Now we need to roll the pieces
into dumpling wrappers.

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:31.550
Stop talking and come help.

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:36.380
Mr. Yu, you are such
a homestyle straight guy.

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.780
I need to call
more people to watch this.

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:45.950
Mom, the water is boiling.

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:47.500
It should be ready.

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:48.580
Almost.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.110
Once we finish these, it'll be enough.

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:51.020
Do not make too many.

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:52.140
Frozen ones are not healthy.

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:53.470
Fresh ones are better.

I want to ask something.

00:11:01.284 --> 00:11:03.130
How many folds do we make
on dumplings at home?

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:05.070
Usually none.

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:06.306
Four folds for Chinese New Year.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:07.860
Eight folds for a wedding.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.070

Are you making them at your place?

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:27.380
It is so nice that my son
can make dumplings at your home.

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:29.780
What are you two doing
after you finish eating?

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:30.951
Alright. I will stop talking.

00:11:30.973 --> 00:11:32.190
Any new movies lately?

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:33.740
He hung up.

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:36.950
Mom, you are going to
scare Dr. Gu again.

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:40.110
Doctors are brave.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:41.260
I will not scare her.

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:55.310
Mr. Yu, you are amazing.

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:56.860
Of course.

00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:57.910
Impressive.

00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:00.020
They are all the same size.

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:03.230
Alright. You may express
your admiration now.

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:05.470
This one is great.

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:06.740
This one is great too.

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:07.780
They are all the same size.

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:11.590
This is perfectionist-level beauty.

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:14.950
Look at their aprons.

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:17.020
Foodie. Chef.

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:18.830
They really match well.

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:20.430
They do look good together.

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:22.950
Alright. I am going to eat my dumplings.

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:24.260
Talk to you later. Bye.

00:12:27.551 --> 00:12:28.740
What are you looking at?

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:30.710
The aprons are stating facts.

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:33.620
(Time is up)

00:12:35.262 --> 00:12:37.195
The dumplings are ready.
I will go serve them.

00:12:44.106 --> 00:12:45.480
These are way too good.

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.120
My ancestors worked
in the imperial kitchen.

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.480
- Really?
- No.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:52.100
Right.

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:53.780
About last time...

00:12:54.106 --> 00:12:56.617
Thank you for making
those four dishes for my dad.

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:58.110
It was nothing.

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:00.230
Eat more if you like them.

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:02.780
If it is not enough,
I can make you some hand-pulled noodles.

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:04.260
I cannot eat that much.

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:07.620
But you are really good
at making dough dishes. Why?

00:13:08.595 --> 00:13:10.859
I studied architecture
at Tianjin University for five years.

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:11.950
The food in Tianjin is great.

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:13.110
Especially the seafood.

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:15.780
And the Tianjin noodles
with gravy are amazing.

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:17.380
Yes, they have eight toppings.

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:20.740
Dr. Gu.

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:22.780
Mr. Zhang.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:23.740
Good afternoon.

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:24.740
- Welcome.
- Hello.

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:25.990
Did you enjoy your meal?

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:27.430
Very much. It was excellent.

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:35.860
Do you two know each other?

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:38.030
Kind of.

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:41.860
And this is...

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:42.950
He is my patient.

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:45.620
And also my friend.

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:49.670
Right.

00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:51.150
Mr. Zhang.

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:53.230
About what happened last time...

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:55.780
What happened between you two?

00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:58.430
Nothing serious.

00:13:58.430 --> 00:13:59.900
My kitchen is next to this window.

00:13:59.906 --> 00:14:02.710
I cook every day. The sawdust flies into
my food. How am I supposed to eat that?

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:04.120
If it is nothing serious, why complain?

00:14:04.128 --> 00:14:05.500
- You are dramatic.
- You're rude.

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:06.620
You are still going on?

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:07.860
Hold on.

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:09.500
I do not know what happened,

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:11.740
but if Mr. Zhang says it is nothing,

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:12.630
then let it go.

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:13.900
Let it go.

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:15.140
Eat your dumplings.

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:16.350
No, we cannot let it go.

00:14:16.373 --> 00:14:17.879
Mr. Zhang, I am sorry.

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:19.020
I did not manage my team well.

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:20.470
Please accept this watermelon.

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:24.900
I do not need the watermelon.

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:26.660
Today's dumplings are on me.

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:27.900
No need. I can pay myself.

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:29.350
Alright, suit yourself.

00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:30.800
Enjoy.

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:32.620
Take your time. Let me know
if you need anything.

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:34.380
- Alright.
- Okay, thank you.

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:44.780
So you invited me
to eat dumplings to apologize.

00:14:45.595 --> 00:14:48.230
I came with you to eat dumplings
and apologize at the same time.

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:53.140
You needed me there for courage, right?

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:54.500
Wrong.

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:56.950
My brain processes things too fast.

00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:59.350
I worry others cannot keep up
and misunderstand me.

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:01.990
You were not very helpful,

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:03.380
but I still need to thank you.

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:06.230
Thank you for giving him
the courage to accept my apology.

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:09.620
You earned this. Here.

00:15:09.862 --> 00:15:11.000
- What?
- You're welcome.

00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:15.190
Do you know why he forgave you?

00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:17.310
Because I was sincere.

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:19.020
Because he is my blind date.

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:21.470
And he has been calling me,
trying to ask me out.

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:24.620
Blind date?

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:26.470
You have not given up on marriage?

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:29.310
Just because you gave up
does not mean I have to.

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:31.310
Here, it is too heavy.

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:32.340
I cannot carry it.

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:37.900
He is over thirty and runs
such a strange dumpling shop.

00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:39.260
He is not stable at all.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:40.190
He is not right for you.

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:41.950
Then what kind of person suits me?

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:44.070
Someone roughly like you.

00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:44.920
That is enough.

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:46.500
What do you mean, roughly like me?

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.900
Someone who is not much better than you.

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:51.020
You are not much better than me.

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:52.550
I am better than you.

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:54.140
Though not by much.

00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:56.500
How are you better than me?

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:57.860
I have an extra watermelon.

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:03.860
Mr. Yu.

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:08.260
Why did you bring Dr. Gu
with you to apologize yesterday?

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:09.900
I went with her to eat dumplings.

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:14.860
So next time you refuse to give in,

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.590
should we get Dr. Gu to help again?

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:21.380
I went with her...

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:23.230
Forget it.

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:28.140
There is a big project.

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:31.900
How big?

00:16:31.928 --> 00:16:32.995
Five hundred square meters.

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:34.540
Is that big enough?

00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:36.020
More than enough.

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:37.260
Mr. Yu.

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:38.860
Take it. Hurry.

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:42.620
Five hundred square meters? Suspicious.

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:44.590
He is an artist.

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:46.950
An artist? Does he even understand art?

00:16:47.284 --> 00:16:49.240
He is a very popular painter right now.

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.500
One of his oil paintings
can sell for hundreds of thousands.

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:52.500
That impressive?

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:55.260
Designing a home
for such a famous artist.

00:16:59.773 --> 00:17:01.360
There will definitely be news coverage.

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:02.470
The budget is generous.

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:04.910
You can design it however you want.

00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:07.950
And he even said clearly

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:10.190
that it must be designed by Yu Yu.

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.780
Then this artist really knows art.

00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:19.710
We will go to his place
for a party this weekend.

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:20.990
A party?

00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:23.540
You need to meet him first,

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:24.990
and check out the house.

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:26.820
I hate parties.

Alright then.

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.150
Since he understands art,

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:43.780
I will make an exception.

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:46.500
A gathering requires a female companion.

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:47.580
A female companion?

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:48.820
Do not look at me.

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:51.780
I am not a woman.

00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:56.100
Why are you looking at me?

00:17:56.595 --> 00:17:57.870
I am definitely not a woman.

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:13.710
Then I will dress as one?

00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:32.230
Dao.

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:35.670
You are not behaving, huh?

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:40.020
When you have a dog,
you must keep the leash on at all times.

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:43.060
Isn't he leashed now?

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:45.020
It suddenly ran, and I missed it.

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:46.462
That is still your responsibility.

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:15.230
There will be lots of good food.

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:45.990
to join me

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:48.300
on my

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:50.430
Journey Bicycle.

00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:55.430
The Journey Bicycle is ready to go.

00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:57.380
How is it?

00:21:59.060 --> 00:21:59.900
Not bad.

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:01.630
This Journey Bicycle

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:03.340
carries my glorious youth.

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:05.100
It holds my memories.

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:08.870
It is the passion of my younger days.

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:11.630
Your passion from your childhood?

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:13.340
No wonder I did not understand it.

00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:16.100
Let us have dinner sometime.

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:17.230
Then

00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:18.910
I can explain it to you slowly.

00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:20.230
No need.

00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:22.060
It is no trouble. Very easy.

00:22:22.062 --> 00:22:23.580
Here, let us add each other on WeChat.

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:26.100
What are you doing?

00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:28.750
Look at this.

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:30.328
What does it look like to you?

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:32.580
It looks like Mr. Yu.

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:37.300
It feels like he has lost in
the battlefield of love his whole life.

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:39.990
It does.

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:47.340
This is one of our big client's works.

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:48.380
What do you think?

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:50.430
This is called art?

00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:51.780
What a mess.

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:52.780
A mess?

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:56.470
Mr. Yu.

00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:58.060
What is wrong with this painting?

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:03.540
It is full of pretension.

00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:04.870
Overly contrived.

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:06.580
It lacks expressive vitality,

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:08.060
and independent thought.

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:09.390
In my opinion,

00:23:09.417 --> 00:23:10.995
the frame is better than the painting.

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:12.990
It has the Rococo shape

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:14.470
and the colors of contemporary art.

00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:15.620
It is impressive.

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:18.750
Well said.

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:20.540
Your comments just now

00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:22.950
will appear in the next issue
of the art review.

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:24.670
I am so happy.

00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:27.340
You enjoy being criticized?

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:28.990
Not exactly.

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:31.470
Because this painting is not mine.

00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:34.580
Did you not say it was your latest work?

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:36.500
I made the frame.

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:38.240
Your sister?
[*Sounds the same as English "made"]

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:42.060
- Mr. Luo Han.
- Alright.

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:44.020
I heard you plan to renovate the place.

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:47.020
Yes. Mr. Yu,
the master designer, will handle it.

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:48.780
Mr. Yu,

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:51.470
what style do you plan to design?

00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:55.870
Of course, it must match
the artist's temperament and taste.

00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:56.820
Secondly,

00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:58.500
it needs to be luxurious.

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:01.060
I want it to feel like
the most exclusive

00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:02.910
private club in Shanghai.

00:24:05.395 --> 00:24:06.710
You are not planning to live here?

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:08.670
I am.

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:13.540
Do not give me
any of that "homey feeling"

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:14.430
or "warm atmosphere."

00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:16.710
I do not need anything domestic.

00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:19.670
All I want is that during my parties,

00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:22.020
my guests will gasp and scream in awe.

00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:26.740
But a house designed like that

00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:27.780
will get boring quickly.

00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:29.230
Then I will tear it down and redo it.

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:31.910
If I do not like it,
I will renovate again.

00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:33.260
Please leave.

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:34.300
Yes. Wow.

00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:35.300
Wow.

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:37.390
What "wow"?

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:38.670
Stop talking.

00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:39.910
Watch your attitude.

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:44.230
Nonsense.

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:57.100
My beautiful lady,

00:24:57.870 --> 00:25:00.950
would you like to know
the story behind this piece?

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:04.710
I do not understand art.

00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:08.190
Hello, Mr. Luo.

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:10.470
Hello, Ms. Lin.

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:11.670
Congratulations.

00:25:11.670 --> 00:25:13.100
Your exhibition is a great success.

00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:15.230
And you have gained a true admirer.

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:19.260
I am very pleased.

00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:29.820
Among everyone here,

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:32.710
only Mr. Yu appreciated
your exquisite frame.

00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:35.630
So you can safely entrust
the design to him.

00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:38.260
Master Yu is not mingling
with the crowd.

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:40.540
He really is quiet.

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:43.060
Sorry, Mr. Yu is

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:44.300
not very fond of chatting.

00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:46.990
It adds to the artist's mystique.

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:49.870
I feel confident giving him my house.

00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:52.950
Let's sign the contract soon.

00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:55.500
Thank you for your trust.

00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:56.740
You are welcome.

00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:11.150
Congratulations on securing
this big project.

00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:14.990
Are you alright?

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:16.740
I guess so.

00:26:18.417 --> 00:26:19.710
Why did you call me here again?

00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:22.780
I wanted to
ask you something about Auntie.

00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:23.780
Auntie?

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:24.900
Yes.

00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:27.430
It highlights that she is your mom too.

00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:28.540
You should handle it.

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:30.500
What about her?

00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:35.500
It seems she is not planning to leave.

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:37.430
She wants to stay
at my place permanently.

00:26:37.706 --> 00:26:39.020
And what is wrong with that?

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:40.580
You do not understand, Yu.

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:42.500
Living with elders means

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:45.260
every habit of yours
has to follow theirs.

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:46.150
For example,

00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:48.190
I still have to wake up
at seven on weekends.

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:50.540
All the food I cook

00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:52.230
must match her taste.

00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:53.795
I cannot even use the vacuum cleaner.

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:55.950
She thinks it does not
clean thoroughly enough.

00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:57.190
It is exhausting.

00:26:57.306 --> 00:27:00.060
So basically, you do not want to live
with your mother-in-law, right?

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:01.060
No. You cannot say that.

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:01.910
Then what can I say?

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:02.840
Stop it.

00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:03.990
No.

00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:06.270
Yu.

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:08.950
I just want you to help me.

00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:10.870
Ask her gently

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:12.100
when she plans to leave.

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:12.950
Ask her yourself.

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:14.060
I am the son-in-law.

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:15.670
Asking would ruin the harmony.

00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:17.230
You are her son.

00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:18.260
It is fine if you ask.

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:20.300
Alright.

00:27:20.417 --> 00:27:21.510
I will think about it.

00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:23.260
Thanks, Yu.

00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:25.380
(I will hold on to this peace)

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:26.900
(and wait for everyone to gather.)

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:28.660
(See you.)

00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:31.100
My brother is here.

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:34.550
- You are here, Yu.
- I am here.

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:39.910
Yu.

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:42.060
Don't forget to ask Mom
about that thing later.

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:42.900
Just that matter.

00:27:44.173 --> 00:27:44.879
Alright.

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:46.630
Have a seat first.
I will get you some water.

00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:47.580
- Mom.
- Uncle.

00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:49.284
- This is for you.
- She is calling you.

00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:57.060
You do not like it?

00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:16.540
Mom.

00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:19.060
What is your relationship
with Dr. Gu now?

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:23.020
Doctor and patient.

00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:26.470
What kind of patient goes to
a doctor's home to make dumplings?

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:28.990
We ate at a restaurant.

00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:30.990
A restaurant
where you can make dumplings?

00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:34.340
Can you come up with a believable lie?

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:36.060
The restaurant is an unbelievable one.

00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:37.990
Let me tell you,

00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:40.820
next time you two go on a date,
take me with you.

00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:42.190
Why?

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:44.670
So I can see
how your relationship is progressing.

00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:46.630
She will not notice me.

00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:47.990
That is spying.

00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:49.740
How is that spying?

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:50.740
Mom.

00:28:50.817 --> 00:28:52.617
Keep your voice down.
We are watching TV.

00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:00.060
I have seen this cartoon.

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:01.260
You watch cartoons too?

00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:04.340
The final villain
is called the "Corpse Emperor."

00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:05.740
Yu.

00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:07.260
How can you be like this?

00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:09.150
Spoilers are shameful, you know.

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:12.020
- Keep watching if you do not believe me.
- Enough. Go home.

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:13.390
Why did you even come?

00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:14.660
Alright.

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:17.820
Dad, why did you call Uncle over?

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:18.990
Exactly.

00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:21.230
Your uncle loves you very much.

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:22.550
No, he does not.

00:29:22.551 --> 00:29:23.740
You do not like him anymore?

00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:26.780
Why did you not ask Mom?

00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:27.820
I did not get the chance.

00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:47.910
Where is your mother?

00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:58.820
When exactly do you have time?

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:01.390
How about tomorrow?

00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:02.660
Hello?

00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:04.870
Mr. Yu.

00:30:06.106 --> 00:30:07.500
Are you on a date with that artist?

00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:09.190
No.

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:13.230
I really do not have time these days.

00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:14.840
So please stop asking me out for now.

00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:16.390
I already said so,

00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:17.595
and he still will not give up.

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:19.630
Just block him.

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:23.580
That feels a bit impolite.

00:30:24.106 --> 00:30:25.870
With someone like him,
a "citrus person",

00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:27.150
why bother being polite?

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:30.060
A citrus person?

00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:34.020
A citrus marries all kinds of fruit,

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:36.430
and produces all kinds of fruit.

00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:40.260
Then that citrus is very loving.

00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:41.990
Do you need me to explain it to you?

00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:43.580
No, no need.

00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:46.300
Well...

00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:47.670
What I really wanted to ask is,

00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:50.780
when will this project
of yours be fully completed?

00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:52.380
Why?

00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:54.820
I was thinking...

00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:57.100
After your project is done,

00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:58.670
I will block him completely.

00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:01.580
Since you were the one
who introduced him to me.

00:31:02.173 --> 00:31:03.630
I am worried it might affect you,

00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:04.520
Wu,

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:05.430
and Xiaoxiao.

00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:08.740
They really need this project.

00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:15.820
Just mind your own business.

00:31:58.670 --> 00:32:00.540
He is pursuing Xia Xiaoman?

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:02.820
That is harassment.

00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:05.990
Artists can be passionate.

00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:08.230
Didn't Tang Bohu pursue Qiuxiang?

00:32:09.351 --> 00:32:10.870
There was no Qiuxiang in real life.

00:32:11.373 --> 00:32:13.773
Tang Bohu cheated in
the imperial exam and divorced his wife.

00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:15.780
He only painted to survive afterward.

00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:18.990
His paintings may be worth billions now,

00:32:19.217 --> 00:32:21.300
but back then, you could swap one
for two steamed buns.

00:32:21.351 --> 00:32:22.870
Look it up if you do not believe me.

00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:24.390
How is that the same thing?

00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:26.670
Good morning, Mr. Yu.

00:32:26.670 --> 00:32:27.670
Ms. Lin.

00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:29.100
I am all done.

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:30.500
You worked fast this time.

00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:31.990
This is what we call

00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:34.340
profit being the greatest motivation.

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:35.950
Mr. Yu.

00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:37.630
Come take a look at my model.

00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:39.900
Come on.

00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:44.060
I am not taking this job.

00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:45.270
What?

00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:52.430
You are really dropping the project

00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:54.106
because he is harassing Xia Xiaoman?

00:32:55.484 --> 00:32:56.870
It has nothing to do with her.

00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:00.340
Then give me a reason. A real one.

00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:04.710
I cannot stand how he sees a home.

00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:06.580
Everything has to be lavish.

00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:09.060
Every guest must walk in and go "wow."

00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:10.540
What does he think a home is?

00:33:11.417 --> 00:33:13.390
And he wants to tear down
my design anytime.

00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:15.710
What? His paintings count as art,

00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:17.100
but my design does not?

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:18.870
If he plans to tear it down anytime,

00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:20.020
why should I do it at all?

00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:25.430
Because he is paying.

00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:26.630
Because this is your job.

00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:27.540
Let me tell you,

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:28.870
this is not just about you.

00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:30.500
Suppliers, contractors,

00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:31.780
me, Wu, Xiaoxiao,

00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:32.820
and dozens of people

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:34.230
are tied to this project.

00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:36.580
Then get another designer.

00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:39.300
He insisted on having you.

00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:40.190
The contract is signed.

00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:41.540
Who is paying the penalty?

00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:42.940
Me.

00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:43.940
You?

00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:50.060
Unbelievable.

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:51.670
He comes and goes

00:33:51.670 --> 00:33:53.100
whenever he wants.

00:33:59.506 --> 00:34:01.500
Mr. Yu only responds
to kindness, not pressure.

00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:02.500
Should we beg him, then?

00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:03.500
You beg him.

00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:19.750
I was thinking I would wait
until your project is done

00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:21.310
before blocking him.

00:34:21.662 --> 00:34:23.020
I do not want it to affect you,

00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:23.950
Wu,

00:34:23.950 --> 00:34:25.060
and Xiaoxiao.

00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:26.790
They really need this project.

00:34:27.430 --> 00:34:28.310
Mr. Yu,

00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:30.620
fifty thousand is still a lot of money.

00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:32.790
It is basically
half of Wu's yearly salary.

00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:35.700
And recently, when we go out,
I am the one paying.

There is a sense

of sticking to yourself

00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:05.470

I heard from Wu.

00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:27.270
Do not give up
that project because of me.

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:29.710
It is not because of you.

00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:32.620
I can just ignore him.

00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:33.951
I said it is not because of you.

00:35:37.417 --> 00:35:39.390
I did not really want
that job to begin with.

00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:41.140
He is a stubborn camel.

You were just the final straw.

00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:51.180
But you said you
"didn't really want it."

Honestly, I probably
would have tolerated it.

You come here often too?

00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:30.590
Yes.

00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:32.910
I often rent DVDs here.

00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:34.060
DVDs?

00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:35.910
You must have picked
that up from Mr. Yu.

- Sit, please. I forgot.

00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:42.790
You come here a lot too.

00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:45.350
I am in a bad mood today.

00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:46.790
Came to sit for a bit.

00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:49.620
What did he do?

00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:51.790
A big client asked him to design a home.

00:36:51.790 --> 00:36:54.100
Everyone in the company
is working for it.

00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:55.100
The contract is signed.

00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:56.830
And that Yu just quits.

00:36:56.830 --> 00:36:57.870
Is that not infuriating?

00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:00.350
Only he can do something like that.

00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:02.580
When will he ever grow up?

00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:03.660
Grow up?

00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:05.790
Highly unlikely.

00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:06.950
Not much hope there.

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:10.620
But do not stay mad at him.

00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:12.830
Being mad at him only punishes yourself.

00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:14.430
You are free anyway.

00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:15.870
Why not vent to me a little?

00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:17.684
Do not bottle it up
and stress yourself out.

00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:21.220
You are right.

00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:26.950
Inviting me to dinner?

00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:28.950
I see right through you.

00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:30.750
Go on, what is it?

00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:34.390
I cannot invite you to dinner
for no reason?

00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:36.062
You would not ask me out for nothing.

00:37:36.062 --> 00:37:37.328
And you changed into new clothes.

00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:38.580
This is old.

00:37:38.830 --> 00:37:40.660
From the worn fabric alone,

00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:42.390
I can tell it has not been washed.

00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:43.870
I get it.

00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:45.020
Get what?

00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:45.950
You are craving.

00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:48.100
You want to eat my dumplings, right?

00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:50.380
Yes.

00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:51.420
Yes.

00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:53.660
Fine, take off the apron.

00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:54.940
I will do it.

00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:00.020
So...

00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:02.990
Can you continue
with that artist's project?

00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:04.750
No.

00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:09.990
No job is 100% your ideal.

00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:13.500
You know my attitude toward work.

00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:15.750
I know, but...

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:16.750
That is why I cannot

00:38:16.750 --> 00:38:18.270
design a home for someone

00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:19.573
whose values clash with mine.

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:22.910
I treat patients with different beliefs
from mine too.

00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:25.430
But I still have to treat them.

00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:26.430
Take you, for example.

00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:28.500
You know,

00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:30.870
you are not dealing with patients.

00:38:30.995 --> 00:38:32.270
You are dealing with lives.

00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:34.540
I am not dealing with a house.

00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:35.580
I am dealing with a home.

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:37.390
You must protect lives.

00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:38.620
I must protect a home.

00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:40.390
He does not see it as a home.

00:38:40.995 --> 00:38:42.906
This has nothing to do with you anymore.

00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:50.990
Let us look at it from another angle.

00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:54.620
If you continue,

00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:55.990
you will be unhappy.

00:38:56.620 --> 00:38:57.660
If you quit,

00:38:57.660 --> 00:38:59.660
Lin Sa and Wu will be unhappy.

00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:01.310
If they are unhappy,

00:39:01.310 --> 00:39:02.910
you will be unhappy too.

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:04.830
Because they are
the closest people to you.

00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:07.870
Either way, you end up unhappy.

00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:09.540
So you might as well help them.

00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:10.700
Make them happy.

00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:13.660
So just to make them happy,

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:14.790
I have to swallow it?

00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:16.700
They put up with you all the time too.

00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:27.180
Mr. Yu, I am sorry.

00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:28.990
I blamed you unfairly.

00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:31.390
Mr. Yu, you are generous and forgiving.

00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:32.870
Whatever you say goes from now on.

00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:42.140
They put up with you
because they respect you,

00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:43.660
not because they owe you.

00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:47.140
Is this what relationships are?

00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:49.750
It is the responsibility
and duty of friends.

00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:54.910
You can live without friends?

00:39:56.750 --> 00:39:57.620
I can.

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:09.340
(Yu Yu Design Studio)

00:40:26.195 --> 00:40:27.595
Have you been putting up with me?

00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:31.060
It is fine. Just say it.

00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:35.270
Why say that?

00:40:35.351 --> 00:40:37.128
You will just get mad at me later.

00:41:09.310 --> 00:41:10.150
Morning,

00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:12.470
everyone.

00:41:28.928 --> 00:41:31.220
(I went to talk to Mr. Yu yesterday.
He did not agree.)

00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:47.060
This project...

00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:49.580
I plan to take it.

00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:51.220
- Really?
- Why?

00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:52.060
Because I want to.

00:41:58.060 --> 00:41:58.990
Are you all happy now?

00:41:58.990 --> 00:41:59.830
Of course.

00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:02.790
My luxurious European trip
can finally happen.

00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:04.620
Going alone is boring.

00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:06.220
Who said I am going alone?

00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:08.220
Mr. Yu, what do you want for lunch?

00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:09.500
My treat, order anything.

00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:11.660
Except dumplings. Anything else is fine.

00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:13.460
No problem.

00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:14.830
Let me make a call.

00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:20.500
Hello?

00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:21.630
Dr. Gu.

00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:22.790
Ms. Lin.

00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:25.100
Mr. Yu agreed to continue
with the project.

00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:27.830
He agreed?

00:42:27.830 --> 00:42:29.430
You really are a miracle worker.

00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:30.750
Cured him in one shot.

00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:32.100
How did you persuade him?

00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:36.270
I did not really say anything.

00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:39.470
Well, thank you then.

00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:40.500
I will hang up now.

00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:41.980
Goodbye.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.119
