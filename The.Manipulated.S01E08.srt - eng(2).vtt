[Hwang Ilguk] All Purpose
General Electric.

00:01:04.586 --> 00:01:05.587
There a problem?

00:01:07.923 --> 00:01:09.216
Of course not.

00:01:12.594 --> 00:01:15.347
Detective, I'd like to ask you a favor.

00:01:16.098 --> 00:01:17.724
-What?
-It's about Noh Yongsik.

00:01:19.726 --> 00:01:22.396
He gets startled anytime
he sees me on the street.

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.565
So if we barge in there right now,
it'll piss him off.

00:01:26.942 --> 00:01:28.068
Go easy on him, would you?

00:01:32.698 --> 00:01:36.535
[sighs] You listen to me.
Are we here to see an old friend?

00:01:37.577 --> 00:01:39.329
If you don't want to go in,
then stay here.

00:01:39.413 --> 00:01:41.039
I can do this without you.

00:01:46.503 --> 00:01:47.712
-[crackles]
-[gasps]

00:01:48.505 --> 00:01:51.425
[sighs] No. Well, that's not good.

00:01:51.508 --> 00:01:53.552
-[knock on door]
-Coming!

00:01:57.264 --> 00:01:58.265
Officer.

00:01:58.807 --> 00:02:01.059
-How have you been?
-Coming through. Move!

00:02:02.727 --> 00:02:04.354
-Hang on!
-What's that smell?

00:02:04.438 --> 00:02:05.939
Can I help you with something?

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.155
You know Park Taejoong, right?

00:02:13.238 --> 00:02:14.239
Uh, yes.

00:02:14.322 --> 00:02:16.658
-I heard you were close.
-Yeah, sure.

00:02:16.742 --> 00:02:18.994
Have you had any contact
with him recently?

00:02:20.203 --> 00:02:23.415
-I wanted to know how he was doing.
-What else?

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.127
-I asked him if he was staying healthy--
-All right.

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:31.256
So, uh, are you all right?

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.634
-Yes.
-A lot has changed for you.

00:02:35.385 --> 00:02:36.887
Was it overwhelming at first?

00:02:37.721 --> 00:02:40.390
Well, yes, it was really difficult.

00:02:40.474 --> 00:02:43.727
I mean, I wasn't used to taking the bus.
I'd never used a cell phone.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.854
I figured it out eventually, though.

00:02:45.937 --> 00:02:47.814
[laughs] Of course you did.

00:02:49.232 --> 00:02:51.276
Oh! Why don't I bring us
something to drink?

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:52.861
-I'll be right back.
-No need.

00:02:54.029 --> 00:02:55.113
Come here.

00:02:56.823 --> 00:02:58.575
-Come here.
-Okay.

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:02.954
You don't look surprised
that I'm bringing him up.

00:03:03.038 --> 00:03:04.372
Something you want to tell me?

00:03:07.667 --> 00:03:10.921
You're right.
It is a little strange, actually. [grunts]

00:03:11.463 --> 00:03:12.631
Whenever I'm talking,

00:03:15.008 --> 00:03:16.551
you better look at me.

00:03:18.595 --> 00:03:21.056
It's just Taejoong is in prison.
What do you need from me?

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:22.140
He escaped.

00:03:22.682 --> 00:03:25.727
Have you seen him? Was he here?

00:03:27.187 --> 00:03:28.355
Uh, no.

00:03:29.397 --> 00:03:31.441
You won't mind if I take a look inside?

00:03:31.525 --> 00:03:33.360
No. I live here, so I'd rather--

00:03:33.443 --> 00:03:35.195
-It'll only take a second.
-Hey! Please.

00:03:35.278 --> 00:03:37.322
-Come on.
-That's private! No, that's private.

00:03:37.405 --> 00:03:38.949
It'll only take a minute.

00:03:39.032 --> 00:03:40.283
Hey, get your hands off me!

00:03:41.117 --> 00:03:42.244
Oh.

00:03:44.538 --> 00:03:46.039
[sighs] Shit.

00:03:47.707 --> 00:03:48.708
Who are you guys?

00:03:49.501 --> 00:03:51.836
Huh? Just barging in here like this?

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.421
I just need to look in there.

00:03:53.505 --> 00:03:56.216
Yeah, why is that?
Trying to look at my underwear?

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:58.260
Hey. No, these two are...

00:03:58.343 --> 00:04:00.595
This man is a prison officer
and he's with the police.

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:02.180
Gentlemen, this is my daughter.

00:04:02.264 --> 00:04:03.765
Shut up. Don't tell them that.

00:04:04.558 --> 00:04:06.476
Why are a prison guard and a cop
in my house?

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.187
It's work related.
We just have some questions.

00:04:09.271 --> 00:04:11.523
Ah. You two have some questions,

00:04:11.606 --> 00:04:13.650
and that gives you the right
to search my house?

00:04:13.733 --> 00:04:15.485
If you'll let us look inside,
we can leave.

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.237
I know my father went to jail.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.781
-That doesn't mean you can harass him.
-No, we're not--

00:04:19.864 --> 00:04:22.075
You're treating him like a criminal.
It's not right.

00:04:22.158 --> 00:04:23.535
Did you hit me, you little punk?

00:04:23.618 --> 00:04:25.954
You don't get to call me that.
You were trespassing!

00:04:26.037 --> 00:04:28.373
Get out now! Hear me? Get out!

00:04:29.332 --> 00:04:32.586
Get out! I said get out!
Leave now! Get out of here!

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:34.296
Get out of here, you motherfuckers!

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:36.756
-Just go outside!
-Go! And don't come back.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.217
-Sorry for the trouble. We'll leave.
-Get the fuck out!

00:04:39.301 --> 00:04:40.969
-Get out!
-Sorry for the trouble.

00:04:46.141 --> 00:04:48.310
-You, too.
-Huh?

00:04:48.393 --> 00:04:50.103
Go out and make sure they leave.

00:04:51.104 --> 00:04:52.105
All right.

00:04:59.404 --> 00:05:02.449
[scoffs] You two are driving me insane.

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.285
[sighs] Shit.

00:05:06.786 --> 00:05:07.913
I apologize.

00:05:08.496 --> 00:05:11.458
I know this was a surprise,
and we made a mess of it.

00:05:11.541 --> 00:05:12.834
-I'll come back later.
-No, don't.

00:05:14.002 --> 00:05:16.046
I would prefer it if you didn't come back.

00:05:17.005 --> 00:05:19.591
-Sorry?
-Frankly, I...

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:23.261
...am not comfortable speaking with you.

00:05:24.012 --> 00:05:25.889
That goes for the detective, too.

00:05:28.224 --> 00:05:29.225
All right.

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:32.312
I won't bother you again.
Goodbye now.

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.196
[scoffs]

00:05:46.993 --> 00:05:48.078
I said...

00:05:49.245 --> 00:05:51.498
You could have been
a little more considerate.

00:05:51.581 --> 00:05:54.167
[chuckles] You can be considerate
for the both of us.

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:55.251
Sound good?

00:05:55.835 --> 00:05:57.087
We got to keep searching.

00:05:58.213 --> 00:05:59.214
All right?

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:04.219
-All right, let's go.
-[engine starts]

00:06:15.313 --> 00:06:19.234
The Manipulated

00:06:26.783 --> 00:06:28.451
Yes. I'm getting off the bus now.

00:06:30.412 --> 00:06:31.496
Are you here?

00:06:33.456 --> 00:06:34.958
Do I walk over?

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:37.961
It's not an issue.
I can go over to you. Stay there.

00:06:38.795 --> 00:06:39.796
Okay. Got it.

00:06:41.131 --> 00:06:42.132
See you then.

00:06:57.981 --> 00:06:59.357
Oh, hi, there.

00:06:59.441 --> 00:07:00.817
Oh, is the phone yours?

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.111
It is. Thank you for coming.

00:07:03.695 --> 00:07:06.865
My daughter has severe asthma,
so I can't leave her alone for long.

00:07:06.948 --> 00:07:07.949
I get it.

00:07:08.992 --> 00:07:11.786
-Here you go.
-Ah. Yes, thank you.

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.705
Stop by and get your hair done sometime.

00:07:13.788 --> 00:07:14.873
I will.

00:07:15.623 --> 00:07:17.250
You have a great day.

00:07:17.333 --> 00:07:19.294
[motorcycle approaching]

00:07:19.377 --> 00:07:22.589
Ah! What the... Hey!
Go after that guy! Hey!

00:07:25.216 --> 00:07:26.760
[exclaims] Oh, God!

00:07:28.219 --> 00:07:29.471
[tires screeching]

00:07:29.554 --> 00:07:30.722
Hey! There he is!

00:07:33.641 --> 00:07:34.642
Someone stop him!

00:07:36.311 --> 00:07:38.521
Where do you think you're going?
Get him!

00:07:42.525 --> 00:07:44.152
[car honks]

00:07:55.455 --> 00:07:56.539
[cell phone vibrates]

00:08:00.585 --> 00:08:01.586
Yeah.

00:08:04.297 --> 00:08:05.298
Hold on.

00:08:07.217 --> 00:08:08.635
Someone stole the phone?

00:08:09.177 --> 00:08:10.512
Are you serious?

00:08:11.387 --> 00:08:14.182
I'll call the auction house.
Just head back for now.

00:08:22.607 --> 00:08:23.775
[sighs]

00:08:29.823 --> 00:08:31.324
[smashes]

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:44.671
So, this pianist is the victim.

00:08:46.089 --> 00:08:49.342
And they were trying to plant this phone
at the hair salon

00:08:49.425 --> 00:08:50.969
to frame her just like you.

00:08:51.052 --> 00:08:52.470
-Yeah.
-Wow.

00:08:52.554 --> 00:08:55.140
I'd go crazy if I knew I was being framed.

00:08:55.223 --> 00:08:57.308
No matter how many times
you say you're innocent,

00:08:57.392 --> 00:08:58.768
who would believe you?

00:08:58.852 --> 00:09:01.062
I mean, these movement patterns
match exactly.

00:09:01.855 --> 00:09:05.024
Oh! What about those guys
hanging around the hair salon?

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:06.985
Looks like they vanished.

00:09:07.068 --> 00:09:09.028
Then the chain of connection is broken.

00:09:09.112 --> 00:09:11.489
Hmm. No, I wouldn't say that.

00:09:11.573 --> 00:09:15.493
I have their expensive phone, after all,
and they're gonna want it back.

00:09:18.746 --> 00:09:20.623
Also, the police stopped by earlier.

00:09:21.916 --> 00:09:25.587
-What?
-No, it's fine. Don't worry.

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:27.964
They came by to do
some routine questioning,

00:09:28.506 --> 00:09:30.633
Eunbi went off on them
and kicked them out.

00:09:30.717 --> 00:09:32.385
It was... I wish you had seen--

00:09:32.468 --> 00:09:33.720
-Yongsik...
-Huh?

00:09:34.679 --> 00:09:36.806
I don't think staying with you
is a good idea.

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:39.559
No, no, no.
Don't you worry about that.

00:09:39.642 --> 00:09:41.561
It's much better for you to stay here.

00:09:41.644 --> 00:09:43.146
And you know what they say.

00:09:43.229 --> 00:09:45.481
The safest place
is under your enemy's nose.

00:09:45.565 --> 00:09:48.276
So don't worry,
they won't be coming back here.

00:09:50.737 --> 00:09:52.906
I'm sorry I have to keep
asking you for favors.

00:09:54.115 --> 00:09:55.742
Hey, don't talk like that.

00:09:55.825 --> 00:09:58.119
You're not just some random stranger.

00:10:01.497 --> 00:10:03.416
Oh, this. Here.

00:10:52.632 --> 00:10:54.008
[line ringing]

00:10:54.676 --> 00:10:55.677
[woman] Hello?

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.929
Looks like I have your phone, doesn't it?

00:10:59.305 --> 00:11:02.934
If I return it to you,
how much are you willing to pay?

00:11:03.434 --> 00:11:05.478
[woman] What the hell did you just say?

00:11:06.437 --> 00:11:08.022
I could always sell it to someone else.

00:11:08.106 --> 00:11:10.149
[woman] Wait, what? Okay, hold on.

00:11:10.233 --> 00:11:12.193
Just tell me how much you want for it.

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.613
It'll cost you a lot.
And I know you have it.

00:11:16.614 --> 00:11:17.740
Just get it ready.

00:11:20.326 --> 00:11:22.453
[grunts in exasperation]
Just my fucking luck.

00:11:23.329 --> 00:11:24.539
[man] What the hell happened?

00:11:24.622 --> 00:11:26.833
That guy on the bike
drove off with the phone.

00:11:26.916 --> 00:11:29.043
He took it? Are you fucking serious?

00:11:29.127 --> 00:11:31.254
He said if we pay him,
then he'll return it to us.

00:11:31.963 --> 00:11:34.882
This asshole is trying
to sell our phone back to us?

00:11:34.966 --> 00:11:36.050
What do I do?

00:11:39.137 --> 00:11:40.596
It's fine, okay?

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:44.225
You give this guy whatever he wants.
Just get that phone back.

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:48.229
Son of a... Hey, you're gonna go too.

00:11:48.313 --> 00:11:50.398
Make sure you kill this motherfucker.

00:11:51.983 --> 00:11:54.193
This guy thinks he can take my stuff.

00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:25.011
[scoffs]

00:30:26.805 --> 00:30:27.931
Wow!

00:30:29.975 --> 00:30:31.184
[door opens]

00:30:35.272 --> 00:30:37.440
-Huh? Hey, what is this?
-Just a minute.

00:30:37.524 --> 00:30:41.903
-Wait. Who are they?
-It's all right. It's all right.

00:30:41.987 --> 00:30:43.738
[breathing heavily]

00:30:43.822 --> 00:30:46.199
-[whimpers] I'm scared.
-We're okay. We're safe now.

00:30:46.283 --> 00:30:48.493
Ah, you're here, Eunbi.

00:30:50.954 --> 00:30:53.456
[sighs] This is really crazy.

00:30:55.125 --> 00:30:56.293
What?

00:31:01.631 --> 00:31:02.924
-Grandfather!
-Hmm?

00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:05.051
Can I play with this one, too?

00:31:05.135 --> 00:31:07.888
Sure. You can play with that one.
[chuckles]

00:31:07.971 --> 00:31:11.391
I'm letting you play with it
because you ate all your food.

00:31:11.474 --> 00:31:14.936
There's lots of cool stuff here.
Go have fun. [chuckles]

00:31:15.896 --> 00:31:17.606
And be careful, all right?

00:31:30.118 --> 00:31:31.286
What is all of this?

00:31:32.954 --> 00:31:35.415
Uh, it turns out there are
people watching you,

00:31:35.498 --> 00:31:38.043
tracking your movements,
going through your things.

00:31:38.793 --> 00:31:41.796
And we found this.

00:31:44.424 --> 00:31:46.468
It's a file full of information about you.

00:31:52.641 --> 00:31:57.103
Uh... I don't think it's a good idea
for you two to stay here.

00:31:58.021 --> 00:32:01.441
Can you stay at a friend's house,
or maybe with a relative?

00:32:05.028 --> 00:32:06.321
We have nowhere to go.

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:08.490
We should find somewhere new,

00:32:09.449 --> 00:32:11.576
a place with no previous connections.

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:13.578
I think that would be the safest option.

00:32:15.664 --> 00:32:17.374
Where are we gonna find that?

00:32:24.172 --> 00:32:26.675
Huh? What?

00:32:29.511 --> 00:32:31.304
Why are you looking at me?

00:32:37.644 --> 00:32:39.729
-Come in, you can lay her down.
-Okay.

00:32:55.036 --> 00:32:56.746
The sheets are all freshly washed.

00:32:57.414 --> 00:32:58.498
Thank you.

00:32:59.374 --> 00:33:01.501
I'm gonna be sleeping in my friend's room.

00:33:01.584 --> 00:33:02.877
Tell me if you need anything.

00:33:03.753 --> 00:33:05.338
All right, I will. Thanks.

00:33:07.465 --> 00:33:09.759
Also, I just want to say

00:33:10.885 --> 00:33:13.346
this means a lot.
Thanks for doing this.

00:33:16.308 --> 00:33:17.309
Hmm.

00:33:18.018 --> 00:33:20.395
Isn't it nice having people here
after so long?

00:33:22.564 --> 00:33:23.815
-Have a good night.
-Good night.

00:33:23.898 --> 00:33:25.900
-Yes. Good night.
-Sleep well.

00:33:39.873 --> 00:33:42.542
So, this is where you live.

00:33:45.587 --> 00:33:48.173
You're not having any leaks
or anything, are you?

00:33:52.677 --> 00:33:56.973
Uh... I'm gonna go to the store
and get some stuff you might need.

00:33:57.057 --> 00:33:58.141
I'll be back.

00:34:09.652 --> 00:34:10.987
Hey, what the hell?

00:34:11.071 --> 00:34:13.323
Look, that little girl in there
has asthma.

00:34:13.406 --> 00:34:15.325
The smell of smoke isn't good for her.

00:34:18.953 --> 00:34:20.205
You're gonna follow me.

00:34:23.958 --> 00:34:25.585
What are you doing? Let's go.

00:34:28.546 --> 00:34:32.133
This is ridiculous. She's just a kid
and she keeps bossing me around.

00:34:49.484 --> 00:34:50.777
So, who are you, really?

00:34:51.444 --> 00:34:52.821
Are you serious?

00:34:52.904 --> 00:34:54.739
That's why you dragged me out here?

00:34:54.823 --> 00:34:57.283
I'm seriously fucking confused.

00:34:57.367 --> 00:34:59.035
None of this makes any sense.

00:34:59.119 --> 00:35:00.704
I want to know the truth.

00:35:00.787 --> 00:35:02.497
Did you actually kill someone or not?

00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:03.623
[sighs]

00:35:05.583 --> 00:35:07.001
Think whatever you want.

00:35:08.336 --> 00:35:10.463
If you walk away right now
without answering,

00:35:12.382 --> 00:35:14.426
I'm gonna kick out that woman and her kid.

00:35:14.509 --> 00:35:16.136
Don't do that. Come on.

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:18.513
Then why don't you explain it to me, huh?

00:35:19.264 --> 00:35:20.515
Help me understand.

00:35:24.352 --> 00:35:25.562
[sighs]

00:35:39.492 --> 00:35:42.662
[sighs] Can you stop moving around?
Go to sleep.

00:35:46.791 --> 00:35:50.003
-You know, Seona...
-What is it?

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:52.964
What if you were accused of murder?

00:35:54.132 --> 00:35:55.759
Suddenly they lock you up.

00:35:56.551 --> 00:36:00.555
And worst of all, they say you have to
spend the rest of your life in prison.

00:36:02.432 --> 00:36:03.892
How do you think you would feel?

00:36:03.975 --> 00:36:06.603
[sighs] What's with
the stupid questions, huh?

00:36:06.686 --> 00:36:09.522
Seriously, stop being annoying
and go to sleep.

00:36:23.119 --> 00:36:24.913
That fucking idiot.

00:36:25.997 --> 00:36:27.457
He's really pitiful.

00:36:32.587 --> 00:36:33.755
[cell phone vibrating]

00:36:43.223 --> 00:36:44.224
Hello?

00:36:45.725 --> 00:36:46.726
[exclaims]

00:36:48.228 --> 00:36:50.563
Yeah. Yeah. What?

00:36:53.858 --> 00:36:54.859
Yes.

00:36:56.402 --> 00:36:57.779
Yes. Okay.

00:37:06.204 --> 00:37:10.416
It's Eunbi. She said to call this number
if anything happens.

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:16.506
How come you get so nervous
whenever your daughter calls you?

00:37:17.298 --> 00:37:19.801
If she called twice,
you might have a heart attack.

00:37:21.052 --> 00:37:23.763
Actually, that was my first
phone call with her.

00:37:24.848 --> 00:37:26.766
I didn't even know her phone number.

00:37:29.561 --> 00:37:32.939
[chuckling]

00:37:35.066 --> 00:37:36.943
-[laughing]
-Hmm?

00:37:37.026 --> 00:37:40.405
Hey, I found out
where my daughter lives today.

00:37:40.488 --> 00:37:42.490
I even got her phone number.

00:37:42.574 --> 00:37:44.242
[chuckles]

00:37:44.325 --> 00:37:47.120
I think you're my lucky charm,
Taejoong, eh? Yeah.

00:37:48.037 --> 00:37:50.790
What kind of daughter doesn't
give her dad her phone number?

00:37:50.874 --> 00:37:53.126
And she won't even tell you
where she lives?

00:37:53.209 --> 00:37:55.962
I don't know how you put up with her
when she's so rude to you.

00:37:56.045 --> 00:37:58.923
Oh, no, she's really sweet
underneath all that.

00:38:00.049 --> 00:38:03.636
I... took something
that was very precious to her.

00:38:04.888 --> 00:38:06.764
I've committed many sins.

00:38:08.099 --> 00:38:09.934
Too many to ever pay her back.

00:38:14.689 --> 00:38:17.150
Oh. Here. Hold the wheel for a moment.

00:38:17.233 --> 00:38:18.776
-Right now?
-Yeah.

00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:21.487
-I want to save her number.
-You can save her number later.

00:38:21.571 --> 00:38:23.573
-Wait. Hold on...
-Keep your eyes on the road.

00:38:23.656 --> 00:38:25.116
-All right.
-Just wait till we get home.

00:38:25.199 --> 00:38:26.701
-It can wait.
-Just hold on.

00:38:26.784 --> 00:38:28.077
-Here.
-[Taejoong] Oh, Jesus!

00:38:28.161 --> 00:38:29.829
-[horns honking]
-Come on! Eyes up front.

00:38:29.913 --> 00:38:31.623
-This is dangerous.
-I saved it. We're good.

00:38:31.706 --> 00:38:32.749
[Taejoong] Geez!

00:38:36.127 --> 00:38:39.714
Oh, dear. It looks like So Hyeon
turned this place into a playroom.

00:38:39.797 --> 00:38:43.301
Wow, We were so out of it,
we forgot to turn off the TV.

00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:46.054
-Ah, well, let's see...
-No, give it to me.

00:38:46.137 --> 00:38:47.347
Oh! Okay.

00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:50.058
Why don't we go ahead and eat?
I'll clean all this up later.

00:38:50.141 --> 00:38:51.267
No, I can clean this up.

00:38:51.351 --> 00:38:53.269
[reporter on TV]
Now an important news update.

00:38:53.353 --> 00:38:55.438
Previously, we reported
on the horrific story...

00:38:55.521 --> 00:38:57.941
Hey, I'll do that later.
Let's eat while the food's hot.

00:38:58.024 --> 00:39:00.360
-Right, okay, I'm coming.
-Huh?

00:39:00.944 --> 00:39:04.322
The case has drawn public outrage
due to the gruesome nature of the murder.

00:39:04.405 --> 00:39:06.407
The police have suspected
that the perpetrator

00:39:06.491 --> 00:39:08.952
was someone
that the victim had known closely,

00:39:09.035 --> 00:39:10.620
and yesterday at 4:00 p.m.,

00:39:10.703 --> 00:39:13.831
they announced they had already secured
substantial evidence and were narrowing

00:39:13.915 --> 00:39:16.167
-their investigative network...
-What is it?

00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:18.920
[reporter] The police were able to
make an arrest.

00:39:19.003 --> 00:39:22.215
The suspect, who is now in custody,
was revealed to be...

00:39:22.298 --> 00:39:24.175
Doesn't the phone belong to that pianist?

00:39:24.258 --> 00:39:26.552
[reporter] ...the victim
had frequently visited.

00:39:26.636 --> 00:39:30.098
The police believe the suspect committed
suicide immediately after the crime,

00:39:30.181 --> 00:39:31.557
and we have reports that they are now

00:39:31.641 --> 00:39:33.434
-speeding up their investigation.
-Shit.

00:39:33.518 --> 00:39:37.939
Hold on. Does this mean there was
another target besides So Hyeonjung?

00:39:38.606 --> 00:39:40.108
What on earth is this?

00:39:40.191 --> 00:39:41.734
[reporter] Now, on to our next story...

00:39:47.573 --> 00:39:49.117
I told you, didn't I?

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:51.411
Everything falls into place eventually.

00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:55.373
For now, I'd recommend you send
your kid away on a trip or something.

00:39:56.791 --> 00:39:59.419
I look forward to your support.
Thank you, Minister.

00:40:25.403 --> 00:40:27.238
[labored breathing]

00:40:42.879 --> 00:40:43.963
Shit.

00:41:00.063 --> 00:41:01.731
[Nanny] I know
there was some trial and error.

00:41:01.814 --> 00:41:03.900
Fortunately, everything worked out.

00:41:04.609 --> 00:41:06.360
And it was all thanks to you, sir.

00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:09.655
Did it seem like trial and error to you?

00:41:11.074 --> 00:41:12.075
Was it not?

00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:16.162
I told my clients these guys
would all drop dead on their own.

00:41:16.662 --> 00:41:21.042
They would simply kill themselves
once they got desperate enough.

00:41:21.751 --> 00:41:23.336
That's what I was betting on.

00:41:24.212 --> 00:41:26.005
-And it seemed foolproof.
-Hmm.

00:41:27.298 --> 00:41:28.466
But not with Taejoong.

00:41:29.592 --> 00:41:32.428
Don't you think this will end up
becoming an issue?

00:41:32.512 --> 00:41:34.388
It's an opportunity to grow.

00:41:34.472 --> 00:41:37.016
From now on,
there will be no more exceptions.

00:41:43.731 --> 00:41:45.942
[machinery whirring]

[squelching]

00:42:19.767 --> 00:42:21.018
[laughs]

00:42:27.191 --> 00:42:29.861
[breathing heavily]

00:42:30.653 --> 00:42:33.781
Perhaps I should be thanking him
for helping us.

00:42:33.865 --> 00:42:35.533
[laughing]

00:42:56.137 --> 00:42:57.597

I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT @d_ _kyung

Now it's time to follow the right path,
