[Episode 25]

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:40.100
Hurry up! Hurry up!

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.060
Second Master,

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.510
what took you so long?

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.760
You two!

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.560
You didn't come upstairs to save me!

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.290
Trying to keep the money for yourselves?

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.440
I should kick both your useless asses!

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:19.790
Wait, Second Master!

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.800
It's not what you think.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.870
Second Master!

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.260
Second Master!

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.190
I'm sorry!

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.520
I'm sorry!

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:27.190
We surrender.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.850
You two useless fools,

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.710
hurry up and carry me out of here!

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:31.840
I can't run anymore.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:32.430
I can't run anymore.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.230
I need a break.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.710
A break?

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.130
Do you have a death wish?

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.190
Waiting for officials to arrest us?

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.310
Now lift me and run!

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.880
You aren't the one carrying the chest.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.320
Why don't you try it?

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.829
How dare you speak to me like that?

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:48.240
Dagger, dagger.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.840
No, no.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.400
-I dare you to say it again!
-Second Master.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.310
The old man in the chest

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.420
is just too heavy.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.820
We've been set up.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.120
The money in the exchange shop

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.560
can't be retrieved anymore.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.220
Why don't we

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.120
kill that old guy?

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.680
That's right, Second Master.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.520
Let's kill him

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:07.840
and take out what's inside.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.310
We three can split it equally

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.370
and flee together.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.690
Who am I?

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.370
And who are you two?

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.950
You think you can share equally with me?

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.800
You!

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.800
What are you trying to do?

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:21.530
You…

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.700
Don't do anything stupid!

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.520
I'm the Deputy Leader!

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.120
No, no, no.

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.390
We're like brothers.

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:33.800
Back then,

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.640
I was the one who took you two in.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.870
Took us in?

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.190
You just wanted us

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.650
to be your slaves forever!

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.480
The treasure in the chest is all yours.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.000
Spare me, please!

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.800
Spare you?

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.170
So you can kick our asses again?

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:04.960
Qilang,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.130
open the chest.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.200
Let me rest a bit more.

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.210
How dare you talk back?

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.090
Why don't you open it yourself?

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.470
I'm not your real brother.

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:16.930
Why do you order me around?

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.800
Are you an idiot?

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.240
You want me to kick your ass, don't you?

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.700
You want to kick my ass too?

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.520
That's why I keep you around.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.630
Splitting the loot two ways

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.310
is better than splitting it three ways.

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.360
But it's even better

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.690
to keep it all to myself!

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.840
Go to hell!

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:17.000

Greetings, Officer.

[Xuanhuo]

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.630
I lied to those bandits

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.420
that I had a lot of money

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.830
stored in an exchange shop,

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.090
and only I personally could withdraw it.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.850
That's why they didn't kill me.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:14.160
[Wine and Verses]

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.430
They kept me in a chest

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.240
and gave me some food

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.630
and water at night.

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.310
They brought the Xuanhuo Troupe
to Chang'an this time

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.750
to force me

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:28.430
to withdraw the money
from the exchange shop.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:29.000
Exactly.

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.950
They even threatened

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:31.390
to kill Mr. Yuan.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.950
If we didn't obey,

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.000
they said they'd bury him alive.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.190
Qilang also forced me

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:37.120
to be his lover.

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:39.040
I felt sick just looking at him.

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:40.630
I had no choice

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:42.690
but to submit to this fake leader.

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:45.190
I was terrified they'd go too far

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:46.390
and kill Mr. Yuan

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:47.600
and all the girls.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.190
Sang.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.730
Don't you have anything to say?

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:58.430
The girls have said everything.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.600
Mr. Yuan survived a dangerous situation,

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.040
which is worth celebrating.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.430
Those bandits had each

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:07.430
taken several lives.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.680
Using a leopard to punish them

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:12.630
and letting the leopard return to the wild

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:15.510
achieves harmony between humans

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:17.140
and beasts.

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:20.190
It seems quite fitting.

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:24.510
It's good indeed.

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:27.390
I was also thinking of
releasing that leopard,

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:28.630
but I'm curious how you

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:30.510
managed the switch.

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:32.850
If the leopard didn't wake up,

00:07:33.159 --> 00:07:34.430
those bandits would

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:35.960
get away with their crimes.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.120
Mr. Ruan,

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.870
don't worry about that.

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:39.190
[Wine and Verses]

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:40.590
If we weren't confident,

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.750
Official Lu would have gone after

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:44.080
those bandits already.

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:47.180
I'm also very curious.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.600
I was tied up

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:50.800
and gagged.

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:53.360
Suddenly, I saw the chest lid open.

00:07:54.159 --> 00:07:54.870
But...

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.580
for some reason, I felt very dizzy

00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:58.800
and passed out.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.120
How I got out afterward

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.070
and who exactly rescued me,

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:07.160
I never saw.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.750
It was me, of course.

out of that chest

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.560
and put the leopard in?

do you have any wine and dishes left?

I was just thinking of
throwing another feast

to celebrate your success in cracking
another major case, Official Lu.

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:36.789
You caught these bandits

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:38.789
right here in my restaurant.

Mr. Wang, if this event

can be written into your poem,

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:47.510
I think the title

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:49.100
won't need to include

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.570
the words "Playfully Presented," right?

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.440
Whether I add them or not depends on

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.270
how sumptuous the feast is.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:46.630
Cheers.

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.600
Cheers.

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:53.960
Cheers.

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:57.170
Let's drink together.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:02.030
[Drink to the Melody of Songs]

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:25.730
[Drink to the Melody of Songs]

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:42.550
Great!

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:09.240
Wonderful!

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:15.870
Excellent!

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:34.310
Excellent!

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:36.360
Excellent!

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:44.510
Here.

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:47.870
Here.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:48.800
All right.

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:56.360
Thank you.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.870
-Come on.
-Cheers.

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.960
Come on, fill it up.

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:25.240
Good wine.

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:29.000
Cheers.

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:34.150
Good wine!

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.720
Where is Yingtao?

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:44.030
Come to my arms and get drunk with me.

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:47.240
Lu,

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:48.910
here's to you.

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:50.000
Come on.

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.200
Good wine.

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:07.270
Su Wuming, watch out!

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:51.790
Sang!

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.900
Don't help the wicked do evil!

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:02.240
It's too late!

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:04.580
All of you have to die!

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:11.910
Screw you!

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:34.200
Fei Yingjun?

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:36.870
So you still recognize me.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.020
We're old friends.

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:40.180
Why are you messing with my business?

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:41.320
You old crook!

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.080
I don't have a friend like you!

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.240
Lu Lingfeng!

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:47.840
He's the one

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:49.700
you want to catch—the Black Fire!

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:52.320
Seize him!

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:16.390
Lu Lingfeng, don't be afraid!

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:17.670
It's just an illusion.

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:37.950
Don't just focus on the bridal chamber.

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:39.910
You must watch in all directions

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:41.970
and listen to everything around you.

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:43.400
Understood.

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:45.000
There's a bigger catch.

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:47.360
-Mr. Yuan!
-Mr. Yuan!

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:49.440
Catch the assassins!

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.220
Ladies, put down your swords.

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:56.000
Don't force us to fight you.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:56.630
Do you want to test

00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:58.160
the strength of a Tang poet?

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:01.670
Be good.

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:03.360
Let's fight our way out!

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.080
Why?

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:04.910
We were

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:06.170
forced by that old man.

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:08.460
We're accomplices at most.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:25.670
You few,

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:28.160
come pick up these things on the ground.

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:33.440
Master Fei.

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:35.120
I've been worried

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.550
you'd get drunk and mess things up.

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:37.910
I'm not drunk at all.

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:39.360
Su Wuming didn't

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.630
even let me drink.

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:42.270
I've been busy all day.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.720
Time to reward myself

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:44.910
and drink my fill.

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:50.360
Fei, there's an important task

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:51.150
for you.

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:52.570
You must not drink.

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:54.440
What could be so important

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:56.170
that it keeps me from drinking?

00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:58.790
According to our secret agents,

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:01.600
the long-hidden Black Fire

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:03.550
has sneaked back into Chang'an.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.349
His target should be

00:17:05.349 --> 00:17:06.510
Ruan's Restaurant.

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:08.550
This guy has killed countless people.

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:10.160
His methods are extremely cruel.

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.030
If you drink and ruin things,

00:17:12.109 --> 00:17:14.440
the consequences would be unimaginable.

00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:15.829
Who's back again?

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.200
The moment I heard that name,

00:17:19.349 --> 00:17:20.880
I knew it was an old acquaintance.

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:23.589
20 years ago,
when I was at the Ghost Market,

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:26.000
he was hunted down by his enemies

00:17:26.109 --> 00:17:27.970
and was almost bleeding to death.

00:17:28.109 --> 00:17:29.310
It was I

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:31.710
who dragged you back from death's door.

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:32.400
And yet,

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:34.510
in order to get a magical elixir,

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:35.720
he murdered

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:38.200
four young disciples of the Medicine King.

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:39.880
Those children

00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:42.270
all called me Uncle Fei.

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.400
Today, I'll avenge them!

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:45.110
I...

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:48.350
Give me your sword.

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:49.880
Mr. Fei, why stain your hands

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:51.000
with this old scoundrel's blood?

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.720
Today, I must eat his flesh

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:54.150
and drink his blood. I...

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:56.130
-Mr. Fei.
-Fei, enough!

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:57.680
His crimes are numerous.

00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.270
We must question him thoroughly

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:01.530
to bring justice for all those he killed.

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:02.720
Black Fire,

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:05.440
you've been hiding for 20 years,

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:07.640
yet you dare name this theater troupe

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:10.360
the Xuanhuo Troupe.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.310
"Xuan" means black.

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:14.270
"Huo" means fire.

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.960
You're challenging the county office!

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:18.680
Lu Lingfeng.

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:20.880
Su Wuming.

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:22.880
You two are Master Di's disciples.

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:24.640
I heard about you a long time ago.

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:25.640
I never expected

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:27.880
to run into you here.

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:31.510
Guess I'm unlucky.

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:33.590
You didn't run into us.

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:35.240
We came to

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:36.550
Ruan's Restaurant

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:38.930
specifically to wait for you.

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:40.310
You…

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.160
I just don't understand

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:45.560
how someone with your skills

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:46.680
could possibly be

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.920
captured by Gou Mengchang's gang.

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:51.640
If they hadn't outnumbered me,

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:55.150
I would never
have suffered such humiliation.

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:56.960
You're lying!

00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:58.000
The Black Fire

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.030
is known for his cunning.

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:01.440
If he can trick his way out,

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.040
he will never fight head-on.

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:04.400
His specialty

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.000
is killing with illusions.

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:08.070
If it had been a fight with real weapons,

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:09.160
you would have been

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:11.560
hacked to death
in the wilderness long ago!

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:16.830
Let me ask you.

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:19.830
After hiding for 20 years,

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:22.400
why have you reappeared to commit crimes?

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:24.860
My life belongs to Blood Drop.

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:27.690
I had no choice.

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:31.070
You received a Blood Drop Order?

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.080
I'm going to die anyway.

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.970
Don't expect to get

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:41.470
any information from me.

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:44.760
Arrest them all!

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.930
Official Lu, I'm not too late, am I?

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:51.790
Just in time.

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:53.590
Take these people in the courtyard

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:54.960
and Gou Mengchang inside

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.110
back to the county office.

00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:56.590
Yes.

00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:58.350
Get up.

00:19:58.350 --> 00:19:58.880
Be gentle!

00:19:58.880 --> 00:19:59.210
Move!

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.270
Tie him up tightly.

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:02.750
He knows illusion techniques.

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:03.240
Yes.

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.000
Mr. Su.

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:05.970
Something's not right.

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:07.830
You just said

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:08.960
you came here specifically

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:09.890
to wait for them.

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:12.640
Yet wasn't I the one who invited you all

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:14.200
to my place to make sushan?

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:15.550
You've confused me!

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:20.200
Sometimes, it's better to stay confused.

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.880
Right, right.

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:34.830
Miss Sang,

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:36.070
I could tell from the beginning

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:37.330
that you were coerced.

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:38.440
You stopped in time earlier

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:39.720
instead of helping them.

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:40.750
That proves it.

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:43.150
You're truly observant.

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:46.640
Help me! Help me!

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:47.920
They're already helping us.

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:48.850
So stop yelling.

00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:52.400
Did you forget those girls before you?

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:55.770
Xiaopa and the other two

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:58.310
are all accomplices
of that so-called leader.

00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:59.270
They kidnapped

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:00.510
several other girls.

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.030
Because they were disobedient,

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:04.490
they were either strangled
or buried alive.

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.480
So...

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:08.000
Under such threats,

00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:09.830
you still managed to find a chance

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:11.480
to reveal

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:13.240
the name Black Fire.

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:14.440
Yes.

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.270
Although I was held captive for years,

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:19.310
I refused to accept my fate

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.640
and kept looking for a chance to escape.

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:23.550
I accidentally overheard Xiaopa

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:25.030
talking with that old scoundrel.

00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:27.550
I learned his alias was Black Fire

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:30.830
and that he was
an extremely wicked person.

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:31.960
If the county office got the news,

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:33.270
they would surely come to arrest him.

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:34.680
Then I would be saved.

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:37.680
So I deliberately leaked the information.

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:39.270
It was because of your tip

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:41.270
that the secret agents were able

00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:43.590
to get crucial intelligence.

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:47.270
Only then could we connect
the Xuanhuo Troupe

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:48.790
with the Black Fire.

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:50.080
In that case,

00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:52.350
I've managed to avenge

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:53.790
those few girls

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:54.680
they murdered.

00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:01.210
You're registered as a slave?

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:02.550
Yes.

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:05.030
You've done a great service
to Yongzhou Prefecture.

00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:06.200
As a reward,

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:08.400
the Yongzhou Judicial Official's office

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:10.830
will find a way
to remove your slave status.

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:14.500
That's wonderful!

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:16.510
Miss Sang, you'll be free soon.

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:20.440
Really?

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:24.200
You're not lying to me, are you?

00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:27.750
I'm the Chief of Secret Agents
in Yongzhou

00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:29.590
and also a disciple of Master Di.

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:32.680
I will certainly keep my promise.

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:38.480
Thank you very much.

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:45.880
Today,

00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:49.310
I've proved
to be a qualified secret agent!

00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:51.310
If it weren't for me…

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:52.810
if it weren't for me,

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:55.030
you'd have all been knocked out…

00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:55.440
Let me do it.

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.350
By that Gou guy.

00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:21.030
Xijun,

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:23.030
before they drink later,

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:24.750
let them eat sushan first.

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:25.680
Make sure

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:27.720
everyone finishes theirs.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000
Alright, Fei.

00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:32.000
Look at you,

00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:33.350
always bragging.

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:38.240
But you managed to get that leopard

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:39.640
into the chest.

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:41.860
That does take some skill.

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:45.160
From what I know,

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:48.320
30 years ago, the Black Fire

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:50.510
had already killed multiple people.

00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:54.000
But the troupe leader, Sai Mengchang,

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.480
and Lang Yehu—

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:57.880
their ages don't match his at all.

00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:01.550
I will…

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:06.440
find an opportunity to uncover the truth.

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:08.900
Come on. Fill up the cups!

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:22.590
It's been 20 years

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:24.110
since I last saw that old crook.

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:26.090
So when I first saw him,

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:28.480
I wasn't sure right away.

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:31.070
But then I thought,

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:33.510
with Lu Lingfeng and Su Wuming here,

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:35.160
even if I let him out,

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:37.030
there was no way he could escape.

00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:37.690
Therefore…

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:03.880
You knocked the guy out

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.720
and revived the leopard with incense

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:07.200
and made it obey you.

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:10.440
You are like a divine being!

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:17.680
In the past,
when I treated migraines in Nanzhou

00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:19.750
and cured mute slaves in Yunding County,

00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:21.350
they called me that too.

00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:24.880
Since you are friends of Leng Ji,

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:26.670
there's no need to be so polite.

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:30.000
Where is Leng Ji?

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:31.960
Have him come drink with me.

00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:33.510
I've gone a whole day without meat

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:35.160
and wine.

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:36.030
Leng Ji!

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:38.200
Mr. Fei.

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:39.440
Mr. Fei.

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:41.960
We can set up another feast,

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:43.240
but today

00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:45.160
is Leng Ji's wedding day.

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:47.720
The wedding night is priceless.

00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:49.590
So don't call him out

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:50.590
to drink with you.

00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:51.110
Though

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:52.830
I'm not much of a poet,

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.510
Mr. Gao and Mr. Wang here

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:56.400
are famous poets.

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:58.000
How about we drink with you

00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:58.750
instead?

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:01.270
As long as I'm drinking, anyone will do.

00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:03.840
Lu Lingfeng.

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.570
I made great contributions today.

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.110
You're the Judicial Official.

00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:09.000
You'll have to

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.730
toast me a few more times later.

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:12.400
Su Wuming!

00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:15.000
You've been ordering me around all day,

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.460
so you need to toast me too.

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:19.510
No problem. I'll toast you too.

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:21.830
Yingtao, you're on duty.

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:23.380
You can't leave your post.

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:24.960
The task you assigned me…

00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:28.750
Drinking will mess things up.

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:30.820
Hurry up and go keep watch for me.

00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:33.840
The lights in the bridal chamber
are already out.

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:35.080
What's there to watch?

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:35.720
Wait.

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:41.750
Master Fei, I'll go with Yingtao.

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:44.070
A little drink won't affect the task.

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:44.930
Let's go.

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:46.350
You...

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:47.480
T-They…

00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:51.910
If I remember correctly,

00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:53.590
this should be the fourth time

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:55.200
we've reset the feast.

00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:57.000
Come on, let's drink.

00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.400
Cheers.

00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:00.390
Everyone.

00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:19.240
Tonight,

00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:21.790
this bright moon hanging in the sky

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:24.040
is both the moon of the Tang Empire…

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:28.030
and the moon of poets.

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:31.330
Unfortunately,

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:34.240
I, Ruan Daxiong,

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:37.680
can help the Yongzhou Prefecture Office
catch criminals

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:39.200
but don't know how to write

00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:41.110
better poetry.

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:44.310
Mr. Ruan, please sit.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.350
The bright moon

00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:51.510
can actually make a man like you

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:53.550
suddenly feel sentimental.

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:54.720
This shows

00:27:54.790 --> 00:27:57.590
that Chang'an is filled
with poetic inspiration.

00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:00.110
Writing good poetry

00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:02.480
is just a matter of time for you.

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:06.550
For a long time,

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:08.030
I believed

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:10.640
that poetry came from the poem itself.

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.480
That fine language was enough.

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:20.000
But traveling sorrowfully south,

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.240
then westward,

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:23.510
wandering the world made me realize

00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:25.910
that to write good poetry,

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:28.350
you must love the vastness of the world

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:30.680
and embrace the life within it.

00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:33.760
Only then can one have a poetic heart.

00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:35.830
Poets should be like this.

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:37.790
Heroes too.

00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:39.720
Well said!

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.030
Lu is modest

00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:42.530
and claims he's not a poet,

00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:44.480
yet he summed up

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:46.200
the essence of poetry.

00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:48.400
"Hero" is a great word.

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:50.780
Mr. Ruan, didn't you complain

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:53.420
that your restaurant's name
was too common?

00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:54.830
In my opinion,

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:57.220
you can rename it "Hero Restaurant."

00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:58.270
What do you think?

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.680
That's a wonderful name!

00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:07.400
I'd be honored

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:09.390
to inscribe it for you.

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.720
H-How can I possibly thank

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:15.640
you two?

00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:18.070
No need to thank us.

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:18.530
Come on.

00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:19.680
Let's drink.

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:20.010
Sure.

00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:20.800
Let's drink.

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:21.610
Let's drink.

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:22.200
Let's drink.

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.200
Come on,

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:24.030
let's drink!

00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:24.920
Cheers!

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:35.930
[Happiness]

00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:38.280
I agreed with Leng Ji to meet at 9 AM.

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:40.200
It's time now.

00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:41.790
Why is there no sign of him?

00:29:48.090 --> 00:29:49.490
I'll go knock on the door.

00:29:59.200 --> 00:29:59.960
Mr. Leng.

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:02.440
Leng Ji!

00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:04.200
Yingtao,

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:06.790
you didn't drink too much and fall asleep,

00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:08.920
letting him leave
without noticing, did you?

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:09.920
-I…
-No.

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:11.440
I was with Yingtao the whole time.

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:12.970
Neither of us even blinked.

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:14.070
Oh no!

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:15.640
Last night, they said

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:16.750
they'd commit suicide together.

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:17.400
Have they…

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:18.660
Move aside.

00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:41.070
Ruan Daxiong!

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:45.830
What happened?

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:47.400
Look.

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:48.880
Explain this.

00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:55.830
I drank too much.

00:30:55.850 --> 00:30:56.720
This room—

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:58.240
to prevent intruders,

00:30:58.310 --> 00:30:59.720
a tunnel was dug under it.

00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:01.630
How could I have forgotten?

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:14.750
Since the three talents of Nanzhou
died one after another,

00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:16.760
I've been the loneliest man alive.

00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:18.440
This journey north,

00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:20.640
first to Luoyang and then to Chang'an,

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:21.720
was all to find you.

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:26.110
Today, my wish has finally been fulfilled!

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:28.790
Having been reunited for one night,

00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:30.450
I have no regrets in this life.

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:32.530
Why do you insist on taking me away?

00:31:32.530 --> 00:31:34.440
Aren't you afraid
of being pursued by the authorities

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:35.240
and losing a poet's freedom

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:36.640
for the rest of your life?

00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:39.490
Staying by your side forever

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:40.830
is the greatest

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:42.000
freedom

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:43.350
for me.

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:48.440
It's just that we've put Gao Da
and Wang Youbo in a tough spot.

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.110
They'll

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:51.480
survive it.

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:54.930
I'll thank them properly another day.

00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:59.940
What about
those two disciples of Master Di?

00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:02.670
They'll really have trouble with this.

00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:04.730
They'll have to rack their brains

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:06.600
to find a way to clear your name.

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:09.450
Otherwise,
they'll be held responsible too.

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:13.750
You can still laugh?

00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:15.510
Thinking about every day from now on,

00:32:15.510 --> 00:32:16.910
I want to laugh heartily.

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:17.960
Tell me.

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:19.920
Where do you want me to take you?

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:21.050
My hometown is in Nanzhou.

00:32:21.050 --> 00:32:23.110
If you want to go, I'll take you there.

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:24.720
If you want to return to Luoyang,

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:25.780
we'll go together.

00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:27.240
In short,

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:29.450
I once let you down, but I'll use

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:31.980
the rest of my life to make it up to you.

00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:34.440
What if I prefer a simple life

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.680
and want you to spend every day

00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:38.340
being a normal couple with me?

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.460
How will you be a poet then?

00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:43.240
Who says a poet cannot live

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:45.770
among the rising smoke
of common households?

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:47.710
Perhaps my best poems

00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:48.920
will be born

00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:51.640
in the simple days spent with you.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.680
My strange yet familiar poet,

00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:55.480
let's go.

00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:58.510
My familiar yet strange assassin,

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:00.410
where are we going exactly?

00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:01.910
It's up to you.

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:03.070
Wherever you want to go,

00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:04.070
I will go with you.

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:37.160
Official Lu.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.510
I am the guarantor.

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:41.830
I'm ready

00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:44.630
to accept the punishment
for covering for Leng Ji.

00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:47.010
Do you need to tie me up?

00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:47.920
Go ahead.

00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:52.640
How can I possibly

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:54.170
be left out of this, Mr. Gao?

00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:55.370
Besides, didn't we

00:33:55.510 --> 00:33:57.480
agree to travel beyond
the Great Wall together?

00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:58.200
At worst,

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:01.000
we'll leave after serving our sentence.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.660
This way, I can write

00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:04.190
more magnificent poems.

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:06.830
Well, well, you two—

00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:08.230
you had this planned all along.

00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:09.360
Even Su Wuming and Lu Lingfeng

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:10.110
got fooled.

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:37.760
What's going on?

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:42.510
I was drunk just now.

00:34:42.590 --> 00:34:43.760
I know nothing.

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:46.320
The mess still needs to be cleaned.

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:47.120
It's all on me.

00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:53.590
We caught the assassin Black Fire

00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:55.510
and the bandit Gou Mengchang.

00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:57.760
This trip has been quite fruitful.

00:34:58.070 --> 00:34:59.900
As for the rest…

00:35:00.590 --> 00:35:02.150
actually, I was drunk too.

00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:04.960
Great. Then let's go.

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:06.110
Go where?

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:08.000
How can we

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.260
let them off so easily?

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:11.040
Then what do you want?

00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:14.230
I can't release them anyway.

00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:18.320
Unless...

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:19.280
Unless what?

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:22.260
Unless they run away on their own.

00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:25.760
Wuming, you mean

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:28.080
we'll let them crawl out from there?

00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:30.290
That's a good idea!

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:31.600
Those arrogant poets

00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:33.170
should be taught a lesson.

00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:38.960
Balancing emotion and law is tough,

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:41.360
but today's matter
still has to be reported.

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:42.880
I'll head to the office first.

00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:44.410
The rest is yours to handle.

you and Leng Ji are old acquaintances,
aren't you?

Don't deny it.

I'm not the Judicial Official.

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:40.000
Mr. Su.

No lies in front of an honest man.

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:47.920
Leng Ji and I

00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:50.420
were old friends back
in the Divine Capital.

00:36:50.590 --> 00:36:51.280
Or rather,

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:53.760
I admired him even then.

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.030
I once witnessed

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:57.960
the love between him and Jiaonu.

00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:58.960
A month ago,

00:36:59.070 --> 00:37:00.670
I met Leng Ji in Chang'an

00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:01.960
and promised him

00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:03.660
that once I found Jiaonu,

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:05.550
I would do whatever it took

00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:07.440
to help them reunite.

A few days ago,

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:11.150
Lang told me

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:13.360
that Hou was up to something.

00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:14.840
He warned me to be careful.

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:16.370
So I pretended to go hunting

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:17.710
and secretly followed him.

00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:20.100
I discovered he was hiring an assassin.

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:21.540
And the one he hired

00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:23.240
was none other than Jiaonu.

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:26.310
I told you to hurry up.

00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:27.510
Hurry!

00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:32.960
Then why do you still dare

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:34.820
to let him hold the ladder for you?

00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:36.510
He used to be a servant

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:38.320
working under my father.

00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:39.840
I lost my mother young

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:42.070
and grew up on his back.

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:44.960
He is

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:47.830
disappointed in me
because he cares a lot about me.

00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:49.600
If he really wanted me dead,

00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:51.280
he wouldn't need an assassin.

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:52.800
He prepares my meals every day.

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:53.860
One dose of poison,

00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:55.480

00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:25.550
and me?

00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:30.400
[Hero Restaurant]

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:32.400
However, you truly deserve

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:35.360
to be called a hero.

00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:03.910
We're finally going
beyond the Great Wall.

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:06.150
It's a pity Mr. Leng

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:08.280
can't join us.

00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:15.070
What do you think of Ruan Daxiong?

00:40:16.170 --> 00:40:17.710
One can't judge a book by its cover,

00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:19.890
nor judge someone by their profession.

00:40:19.890 --> 00:40:21.400
This man who runs a restaurant

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:23.080
has the spirit of a poet.

00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:25.770
Why don't we

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:28.000
go back and ask him to come along?

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.230
You think so too?

00:40:31.070 --> 00:40:32.620
My poet friends!

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:37.250
Wait for me, my poet friends!

00:40:40.290 --> 00:40:42.090
I've finally caught up with you.

00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:43.190
I've heard

00:40:43.210 --> 00:40:45.140
that in the north,
snow falls even in August.

00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:46.760
I wonder if you two
brought enough clothing

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:48.070
for the journey to the north.

00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:49.930
Also, here are some Sesame Bakes,

00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:51.590
some meat, and wine.

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:53.630
These two gourds contain
sour cabbage soup.

00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:55.090
You can take it on the road.

00:40:56.070 --> 00:40:56.710
Mr. Ruan,

00:40:58.110 --> 00:40:59.240
would you be willing

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:01.400
to go beyond the Great Wall with us?

00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:05.030
Youbo is asking

00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:07.480
if you'd like

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:10.630
to head beyond the Great Wall with us.

00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:12.480
I would love to!

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:14.190
Of course I would!

00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:17.230
Do you have family to bid farewell to?

00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:18.560
I have no family left,

00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:20.150
and I've already entrusted the restaurant

00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:21.280
to Mr. Hou to manage.

00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:22.920
I'm free as a bird now.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.320
Then what are we waiting for?

00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:25.320
The three of us...

00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:26.030
No.

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:28.510
We three Tang poets

00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:30.030
will head west together

00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:31.630
and go beyond the Great Wall!

00:41:34.110 --> 00:41:34.840
A poet...

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:37.260
I've actually become a real poet?

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:39.570
Poet Ruan, don't hesitate.

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:41.840
Ride fast and join us!

00:41:46.110 --> 00:41:48.240
Ruan Daxiong, poet of the Tang Empire,

00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:50.130
sets off today

00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:51.440
beyond the Great Wall!
