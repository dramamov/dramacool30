00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:52.119
This bracelet is really beautiful.

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:54.179
How much?

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:55.539
150.

00:00:58.179 --> 00:00:59.179
150?

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:01.340
Are you trying to shortchange me?

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.079
Too cheap

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.060
for me.

00:01:11.019 --> 00:01:12.459
1.5 million.

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:15.099
1.5 million?

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.579
It's really 1.5 million.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.700
This tiny bracelet

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.879
is worth that much?

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:24.379
Where I'm from,

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:25.879
this could buy a house.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.939
Your daughter-in-law
bought all these for you.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.980
Well?

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.140
She's good, isn't she?

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.159
Ye Dong just

00:01:34.379 --> 00:01:35.659
got into prosperity.

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:37.239
It's brought me good fortune.

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:38.819
Absolutely.

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:40.719
Marrying into the Lin family

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.140
is the epitome of good fortune.

00:01:43.379 --> 00:01:44.519
Your ancestors' graves

00:01:44.519 --> 00:01:45.859
must be glowing with pride.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.819
Girl,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.140
you have excellent facial features.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.939
Why don't you marry my son?

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:56.799
Listen, old woman.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.299
You have another son?

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.019
No.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.040
Just joking.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.180
I just think you're quite decent.

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:06.420
(This old hag's such a snob.)

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.539
(Last time she said I looked doomed.)

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.500
(Now, she claims I have good features)

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.439
(and am decent.)

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:12.900
(So money-obsessed.)

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:14.800
(But people like her)

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.560
(are simple.)

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.539
(Just keep giving her benefits,)

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:18.879
(and she'll stay manageable.)

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:20.520
(But)

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:23.419
(watch out for insatiable greed.)

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:34.560
Na.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.379
Xia,

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:41.020
you can see now?

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:50.919
(Oh, no.)

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:53.580
How I wish

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:55.020
I could see.

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:57.939
You can't imagine

00:02:58.219 --> 00:02:59.259
a world

00:02:59.259 --> 00:03:00.560
of complete darkness.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.000
The chilling embrace

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.439
of loneliness.

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:04.780
No end in sight.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.520
No hope, either.

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:09.259
Even breathing

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:10.979
feels suffocating.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.780
Xia,

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:21.099
I'm sorry.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:22.439
It's fine.

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:24.319
This is just how things are now.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:25.599
Besides,

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.240
this isn't your fault.

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:29.539
By the way, Na,

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.199
did you bring all the gifts

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:32.639
for Mom?

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:33.699
They're all here.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.879
Your mother-in-law

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.060
loves them.

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:39.400
You do have a heart.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:40.699
My affection

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:41.939
for you wasn't wasted.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.060
Mom,

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.419
I specifically had Na pick

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:47.939
these collector's editions.

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:49.900
They're not only expensive

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.379
but also collectible.

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:53.020
So

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.180
take good care of them.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.939
They're just little trinkets.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.740
I prefer to stay low-key.

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:01.860
Well then,

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.500
I'll put them away.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.860
(I need to get this devil away,)

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.060
(so I can ask Na for help.)

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.740
Xia,

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:25.860
when I visited Mr. Lin the other day,

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.139
he wasn't home.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.060
And Mr. An

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.100
hasn't answered calls.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:30.819
Is anything wrong?

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.259
(You're really putting me on the spot.)

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:34.660
Nothing's wrong.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.040
Why do you ask?

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.180
My husband

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.699
just saw my father days ago.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.100
Ask him if you

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.899
don't believe me.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.459
Your husband, your husband.

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:44.180
Always talking about him.

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:45.540
How much do you love him?

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:46.939
Ye Dong,

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.899
Xia

00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:49.779
used to be such an icy businesswoman.

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:51.819
How did she turn into
such a simp around you?

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.939
Did you give her

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:53.860
a love potion?

00:04:57.459 --> 00:04:58.339
You've got it wrong.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.579
I'm actually the simp.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:02.939
Dad's been resting lately.

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:04.259
You can't reach him.

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:05.100
That's normal.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.660
Mr. Lin's health
hasn't been good recently.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:09.899
Enough of this.

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:11.939
Honey,

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.220
Na loves drinking

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.860
our hand-ground coffee.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.100
Go make her a cup.

00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:17.579
Alright.

00:05:27.579 --> 00:05:28.199
Na,

00:05:28.579 --> 00:05:29.379
come help me.

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:30.819
I'll tell you one

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.000
of Xia's secrets.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:33.980
Secret?

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.620
Good.

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:38.899
Na.

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:42.540
Honey,

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:43.800
are you

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.779
trying to tattle to Na?

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.060
We haven't seen

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.220
each other in ages.

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.379
I want to catch up with her.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.920
It's fine.

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:52.139
We'll talk later.

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.459
Actually, I'm quite interested

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:55.939
in the secret he mentioned.

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:04.079
Secret.

00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:06.939
Spit it out.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.060
What secret?

00:06:13.019 --> 00:06:14.220
Why the sigh?

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:15.060
Out with it.

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:16.279
Lin Xia plans

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:18.439
to announce
at tomorrow's shareholder meeting

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.459
that she's transferring all her shares

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:22.259
to me.

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:24.680
What?

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:25.860
Are you sure?

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.459
Complete transfer?

00:06:27.459 --> 00:06:28.459
Is she out of her mind?

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:30.639
No way.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:31.860
Unacceptable.

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:33.100
It's complete madness.

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:34.660
Does Mr. Lin know about this?

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:35.939
If he did,

00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:37.019
he'd drop dead from anger.

00:06:37.459 --> 00:06:38.300
This concerns

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.860
the very foundation of Lin Group.

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:41.339
She's not thinking straight,

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:42.699
and you're following her?

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.839
Exactly because it's wrong,

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:47.579
I'm asking you to persuade her.

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.060
Let me persuade her?

00:06:50.259 --> 00:06:50.939
Ye Dong,

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:53.259
let's be honest.

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.339
Aren't you even slightly tempted

00:06:55.699 --> 00:06:56.819
by this mountain of wealth?

00:06:58.019 --> 00:06:59.699
I don't believe there exists

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:00.819
such a perfect person.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:04.379
I'm not perfect.

00:07:05.339 --> 00:07:06.939
But who holds the shares

00:07:06.939 --> 00:07:08.019
doesn't matter to me.

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:10.620
How could it not matter?

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:12.899
If the shares go to you,

00:07:13.259 --> 00:07:14.759
and you abandon her later,

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:16.259
Xia would lose everything.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:18.899
Human nature is the most complex thing.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:20.639
Even if you don't inform me,

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:21.980
once I know about this,

00:07:22.259 --> 00:07:24.060
I'll stop her with everything I've got.

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:26.579
Clearly, you

00:07:27.259 --> 00:07:28.379
genuinely care about her.

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:29.540
Her current actions

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:30.220
are irrational.

00:07:30.459 --> 00:07:31.579
Please make her see reason.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:32.740
Of course,

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:34.180
it's extremely irrational.

00:07:34.939 --> 00:07:36.019
Actually, she's doing this

00:07:36.459 --> 00:07:37.420
all for my sake.

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:39.500
She just wants me

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:40.839
to look authoritative

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.139
in the acting CEO position.

00:07:42.379 --> 00:07:43.920
That's why she's risking everything.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.180
Honestly,

00:07:46.339 --> 00:07:47.699
it's putting huge pressure on me.

00:07:50.019 --> 00:07:51.579
You must be secretly enjoying this.

00:08:07.339 --> 00:08:07.920
Xia,

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.399
when did you become

00:08:09.399 --> 00:08:10.259
such a lovesick fool?

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:11.180
What's wrong?

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:13.199
How can your shares

00:08:13.199 --> 00:08:14.579
be transferred so easily?

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:16.259
Does Mr. Lin know?

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:17.459
He doesn't, right?

00:08:17.779 --> 00:08:18.779
If he does,

00:08:18.779 --> 00:08:19.819
he'd be furious.

00:08:20.139 --> 00:08:20.860
Honey,

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:22.660
you even told Na about this?

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:24.420
You tried to hide something

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:25.660
this important from me?

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:27.300
Do you even think of me as your bestie?

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:29.379
I knew you wouldn't agree,

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.180
so I didn't discuss it with you.

00:08:31.459 --> 00:08:31.980
You!

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:33.620
Enough, Na.

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:35.000
I've made up my mind.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:36.740
Don't try to persuade me.

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:38.700
Na,

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:39.840
do you remember

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:41.519
the promise we made as kids?

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.460
If one of us makes a decision,

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:44.419
the other

00:08:44.419 --> 00:08:46.019
will support her unconditionally.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:48.700
If I hadn't seen

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:50.019
the SOS you wrote

00:08:50.019 --> 00:08:51.480
on that van,

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:54.059
you might've been sold off
by traffickers.

00:08:54.059 --> 00:08:55.240
My mom said

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.299
SOS

00:08:57.539 --> 00:08:58.980
is a distress signal.

00:08:59.139 --> 00:09:00.059
I'm Lin Xia.

00:09:00.059 --> 00:09:01.179
What's your name?

00:09:01.179 --> 00:09:02.500
I'm Lin Na.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.019
Let's be friends.

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:06.259
(Do you remember that?)

00:09:08.019 --> 00:09:08.740
Yes.

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:10.340
Of course I do.

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:21.799
So,

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.720
you'll support me

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:24.860
in transferring

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:26.539
all my shares to my husband Ye Dong,

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:27.600
right?

00:09:29.039 --> 00:09:30.059
(Xia can see.)

00:09:30.059 --> 00:09:31.039
(She's pretending.)

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.740
(She's signaling for help.)

00:09:40.059 --> 00:09:40.659
Xia,

00:09:41.019 --> 00:09:41.580
of course.

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:42.700
I'll absolutely support you.

00:09:45.379 --> 00:09:46.080
Thank you.

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:48.940
Ye Dong,

00:09:49.139 --> 00:09:50.259
I've been here this long,

00:09:50.419 --> 00:09:52.059
and you haven't cut any fruit for me?

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:53.379
Are you unhappy to see me?

00:09:53.899 --> 00:09:54.440
Go.

00:09:54.759 --> 00:09:55.919
Go prepare some fruit.

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:57.419
My apologies.

00:10:02.759 --> 00:10:03.659
Mu Feng.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.460
(Why is there no signal?)

00:10:11.639 --> 00:10:12.480
(What should I do?)

00:10:13.779 --> 00:10:14.220
Dong.

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:15.399
Go get some fruit.

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:16.700
Yes.

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:18.019
Dong,

00:10:18.299 --> 00:10:19.779
the signal jammer is installed.

00:10:38.059 --> 00:10:38.980
Xia, Ye Dong,

00:10:39.259 --> 00:10:40.539
I need to make a private call.

00:10:51.539 --> 00:10:53.200
(Call quickly.)
