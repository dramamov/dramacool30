WEBVTT

00:01:10.682 --> 00:01:13.840
(Returning Pearl)

00:01:16.208 --> 00:01:17.488
I'm sorry, Xiao Yan Zi.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.976
I was the one

00:01:19.568 --> 00:01:20.727
who drew that turtle.

00:01:20.807 --> 00:01:22.881
I know. And you did it

00:01:23.167 --> 00:01:24.864
because you like Lord Jing.

00:01:24.945 --> 00:01:26.058
I don't...

00:01:30.048 --> 00:01:32.304
Well, if that's how you want to interpret it, I'll take it.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.399
As long as you don't fall for Jing Yuan,

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.280
the plot can move forward smoothly.

00:01:36.367 --> 00:01:39.703
You were trying to make me dislike Lord Jing,

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.473
right?

00:01:42.848 --> 00:01:46.224
Honestly, he's skilled, he's handsome,

00:01:46.688 --> 00:01:47.864
and I kind of like him.

00:01:48.688 --> 00:01:49.944
But you're going to all this trouble,

00:01:50.087 --> 00:01:51.584
it shows you must be

00:01:52.594 --> 00:01:53.707
deeply...

00:01:54.208 --> 00:01:55.321
Deeply what?

00:01:56.048 --> 00:01:57.161
Deeply and devotedly in love.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.104
Yes, that's it! The point is, you must really like him.

00:02:00.967 --> 00:02:03.488
If there's one thing about me, I value loyalty above all.

00:02:03.568 --> 00:02:04.681
Sisters come first!

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.784
I would never ever steal my best friend's crush.

00:02:08.408 --> 00:02:10.064
She's wonderful.

00:02:10.761 --> 00:02:11.874
Xiao Yan Zi...

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:17.104
Don't look at me like that, you're making me shy.

00:02:18.767 --> 00:02:19.880
Lin Er.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.660
You saved my life.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.519
Whoever you fall for,

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.801
I'll absolutely, absolutely help you get together.

00:02:27.088 --> 00:02:28.384
Matchmaking guaranteed!

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.966
Then I'll copy the Three Character Classic one hundred times for you.

00:02:35.047 --> 00:02:36.703
My handwriting is just as ugly as yours anyway.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.624
Lin Er, you're the best!

00:02:43.408 --> 00:02:44.521
What's that word again...

00:02:45.368 --> 00:02:46.481
Okay!

00:02:47.647 --> 00:02:48.760
Very okay!

00:02:54.447 --> 00:02:55.664
I always thought this place

00:02:56.287 --> 00:02:57.744
was just a story world,

00:02:58.447 --> 00:02:59.784
and they were just characters in it.

00:03:01.088 --> 00:03:02.303
But in this moment,

00:03:04.207 --> 00:03:06.303
Xiao Yan Zi's loyalty to me is real.

00:03:07.248 --> 00:03:09.023
And the affection I feel for her is real too.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.936
If these feelings are real,

00:03:22.487 --> 00:03:24.384
these people, to me,

00:03:27.887 --> 00:03:29.944
are living, breathing human beings.

00:03:35.487 --> 00:03:37.052
- You... - Serves you right.

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:40.537
You've been waiting here just to say that to me?

00:03:45.601 --> 00:03:46.937
You're not getting any younger.

00:03:47.487 --> 00:03:49.384
It's time you started thinking about marriage.

00:03:49.528 --> 00:03:52.454
If there's someone you like, you may tell me.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.935
As for the lady you marry, her appearance,

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:02.896
character...

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.753
She won't make it.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.013
- And virtue. - But before he could finish teaching me,

00:04:12.287 --> 00:04:14.220
he passed away.

00:04:14.568 --> 00:04:17.327
Must all be of the highest standard.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.617
If you lose,

00:04:18.928 --> 00:04:20.784
you will die miserably.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.593
Deal!

00:04:28.728 --> 00:04:29.841
Yuan?

00:04:30.847 --> 00:04:31.960
Yuan?

00:04:34.368 --> 00:04:35.482
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.696
Since Princess Huan Zhu is illiterate,

00:04:38.367 --> 00:04:40.264
we shouldn't trouble Mister Ji further.

00:04:40.728 --> 00:04:41.983
Let her learn from you instead.

00:04:42.327 --> 00:04:45.344
With your martial skills, you're more than qualified to teach her.

00:04:47.407 --> 00:04:48.664
As you command, Your Majesty.

00:04:53.967 --> 00:04:56.264
Princess Huan Zhu has always been fond of swords and spears.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.920
Having Lord Jing teach her martial arts

00:04:59.048 --> 00:05:00.088
is just catering to her tastes.

00:05:00.168 --> 00:05:02.648
She's sure to admire him greatly,

00:05:02.728 --> 00:05:04.183
and love will grow with time.

00:05:06.248 --> 00:05:08.503
That boy has had a hard life. I feel for him.

00:05:09.767 --> 00:05:11.344
If he becomes a prince,

00:05:11.608 --> 00:05:14.344
it will put an end to those idle rumors in the palace.

00:05:20.207 --> 00:05:21.586
Your Highness, please hold your stance.

00:05:22.568 --> 00:05:23.863
Lord Jing,

00:05:24.207 --> 00:05:25.824
I've been in this posture for 30 minutes.

00:05:26.207 --> 00:05:28.024
I really can't hold it any longer.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.015
This is Her Majesty's command.

00:05:30.407 --> 00:05:31.746
I dare not be negligent.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.600
Just hold on a little longer.

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:35.283
At least for another hour.

00:05:35.507 --> 00:05:38.324
But what if I can't hold on until then?

00:05:42.967 --> 00:05:44.080
Chin up!

00:05:45.447 --> 00:05:46.704
This is bad. This is really bad!

00:05:47.188 --> 00:05:49.342
If they keep spending time together, I'm finished.

00:05:50.128 --> 00:05:53.423
What can I do to get Fifth Prince to compete with him?

00:05:57.287 --> 00:06:00.168
Mister Ji's lecture today was truly enlightening, wasn't it?

00:06:00.248 --> 00:06:01.285
It was.

00:06:03.168 --> 00:06:05.584
I'm sorry! Please forgive me, Your Highness.

00:06:06.168 --> 00:06:07.344
Greetings, Lord Fu.

00:06:07.488 --> 00:06:08.943
Why are you in such a hurry?

00:06:09.128 --> 00:06:12.144
I went to the training grounds to bring Princess Huan Zhu some snacks,

00:06:12.368 --> 00:06:15.863
and I found her on the verge of collapse from Lord Jing's harsh training.

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.197
It's been four hours.

00:06:17.688 --> 00:06:19.503
Lord Jing is so terrifyingly strict.

00:06:19.608 --> 00:06:21.543
He wouldn't even let Her Highness take a break.

00:06:21.967 --> 00:06:23.080
So I thought

00:06:23.327 --> 00:06:25.584
I could prepare her favorite snacks

00:06:25.808 --> 00:06:27.104
and bring them over.

00:06:27.287 --> 00:06:28.464
It'll calm her nerves.

00:06:29.287 --> 00:06:32.063
Jing Yuan is always so rigid and strict.

00:06:32.287 --> 00:06:33.623
Xiao Yan Zi is new to the palace.

00:06:33.808 --> 00:06:35.704
She's bound to suffer under his watch.

00:06:35.993 --> 00:06:38.024
Er Kang, we'd better go check on her.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.513
We don't want her getting hurt.

00:06:42.967 --> 00:06:43.993
Yes!

00:06:45.447 --> 00:06:46.560
Xiao Yan Zi!

00:06:48.087 --> 00:06:49.200
Yong Qi!

00:06:49.407 --> 00:06:53.943
If you two had come any later, Jing Yuan would've trained me to death!

00:06:54.327 --> 00:06:55.440
Alright, you're safe now.

00:06:56.527 --> 00:06:58.183
Jing Yuan may be a little strict,

00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:59.756
but he is doing it for your own good.

00:07:00.728 --> 00:07:02.648
He trained with extreme diligence since childhood.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.406
I guess he expects others to do the same.

00:07:04.487 --> 00:07:06.304
What "for my own good"?

00:07:06.447 --> 00:07:07.560
I think he just...

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.074
- He just wants to kill me, that's what! - Alright, no more of this.

00:07:11.207 --> 00:07:14.383
How about I have the imperial kitchen make you some lotus pastries?

00:07:15.048 --> 00:07:16.264
Lotus pastries?

00:07:16.688 --> 00:07:18.679
Fine, but not just lotus pastries.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.060
I want plum blossom pastries, peach blossom pastries,

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.440
chrysanthemum pastries, all of it!

00:07:21.527 --> 00:07:23.327
Alright, alright, you can have them all.

00:07:23.407 --> 00:07:24.520
Xiao Yan Zi.

00:07:24.808 --> 00:07:25.921
Look.

00:07:26.527 --> 00:07:28.169
Lin Er, you get me.

00:07:28.249 --> 00:07:29.423
Xiao Yan Zi, there's no rush.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.200
Let's go back to Shufang Hall and rest first.

00:07:31.274 --> 00:07:33.600
And you can have all the pastries you want.

00:07:34.608 --> 00:07:36.767
His Highness is right. His pastries are better.

00:07:36.847 --> 00:07:37.960
Let's go back now.

00:07:38.728 --> 00:07:39.767
Easy there.

00:07:39.847 --> 00:07:42.200
Let's go.

00:07:51.041 --> 00:07:53.216
A hundred copies? All done.

00:07:54.928 --> 00:07:56.584
I really am a genius.

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:58.679
You must be the palace maid Lin Sui Sui.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.714
Come with us. Her Majesty wishes to see you.

00:08:01.527 --> 00:08:02.640
Come on!

00:08:06.767 --> 00:08:07.848
You wretched slave,

00:08:07.928 --> 00:08:09.784
so you are in league with Princess Huan Zhu.

00:08:09.887 --> 00:08:11.904
I gave you a little leeway,

00:08:12.128 --> 00:08:14.344
and you couldn't hide your true motives.

00:08:15.207 --> 00:08:16.320
I'm innocent!

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.416
I only helped Xiao Yan Zi with the copying

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.120
to gain her trust

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:24.559
I'm your eyes in Shufang Hall.

00:08:26.128 --> 00:08:29.503
Then what about informing Fifth Prince and Er Kang?

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.496
Stopping Jing Yuan from getting close to Xiao Yan Zi?

00:08:31.728 --> 00:08:34.304
Was that also winning her over for me?

00:08:34.608 --> 00:08:36.704
You're pretending to serve me,

00:08:37.208 --> 00:08:39.424
just to pair up Princess Huan Zhu and Er Kang.

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:41.033
You must be

00:08:42.328 --> 00:08:43.743
working for Consort Ling.

00:08:46.128 --> 00:08:47.528
Where did that even come from?

00:08:47.608 --> 00:08:49.760
No wonder Er Kang volunteered to escort

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.639
the Princess for the ceremonial prayers outside the palace.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.297
Ceremonial prayers?

00:08:53.728 --> 00:08:55.720
That means Zi Wei is about to enter the plot.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.936
Consort Ling sees the Princess is favored

00:08:58.041 --> 00:08:59.776
and wants to make Er Kang her prince.

00:09:01.848 --> 00:09:03.687
A clever scheme indeed.

00:09:03.767 --> 00:09:05.544
I'll tie her up now

00:09:05.647 --> 00:09:07.333
and bring her to Consort Ling for a confrontation.

00:09:07.728 --> 00:09:09.863
Please wait, Your Majesty!

00:09:10.767 --> 00:09:11.880
I have

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:13.637
a way

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.775
to prove my innocence.

00:09:22.934 --> 00:09:26.712
Please grant me permission to leave with them.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.136
I can make Lord Fu abandon any thought of becoming a prince.

00:09:32.488 --> 00:09:36.102
If I fail, my head is yours to take.

00:09:48.047 --> 00:09:49.263
I'm tired.

00:09:51.088 --> 00:09:53.464
- You may go. - Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:10:05.368 --> 00:10:07.584
Fortune favors the bold.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.562
I'm just too clever.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:12.577
Once the ceremony is over,

00:10:12.747 --> 00:10:16.327
the Empress will stop doubting me

00:10:16.407 --> 00:10:18.048
and start trusting me again.

00:10:18.128 --> 00:10:19.944
Then she won't kill me on a whim.

00:10:20.047 --> 00:10:22.607
I'm about to start living

00:10:22.687 --> 00:10:25.783
the prime transmigration protagonist dream life!

00:10:30.328 --> 00:10:32.696
By imperial decree, Princess Huan Zhu will perform

00:10:32.776 --> 00:10:35.143
the sacred rites to pray for the people's welfare!

00:10:36.647 --> 00:10:39.560
By imperial decree, Princess Huan Zhu will perform

00:10:39.641 --> 00:10:41.903
the sacred rites to pray for the people's welfare!

00:10:44.368 --> 00:10:48.584
Long live the Princess! Long live the Princess!

00:10:48.908 --> 00:10:53.083
Long live the Princess! Long live the Princess!

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:57.000
Long live the Princess! Long live the Princess!

00:10:57.088 --> 00:10:58.201
What are you doing here?

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:04.096
Shouldn't Er Kang be the one escorting Her Highness

00:11:04.208 --> 00:11:05.567
for the ceremony?

00:11:05.647 --> 00:11:07.903
His Majesty personally appointed me to lead the escort.

00:11:10.328 --> 00:11:11.368
Why?

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:13.127
Are you particularly concerned about Er Kang?

00:11:13.208 --> 00:11:14.321
None of your business.

00:11:15.167 --> 00:11:16.280
Excuse me?

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.841
I said, I'm more interested in you, Lord Jing.

00:11:27.647 --> 00:11:29.168
Why are you surveying the area so intently?

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.360
None of your business.

00:11:30.448 --> 00:11:32.760
I'm enjoying the scenery. Is that a crime?

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:35.625
What could possibly be so interesting on this street?

00:11:36.728 --> 00:11:40.201
What's with all the questions today, Lord Jing?

00:11:42.407 --> 00:11:44.953
I'm carefully observing life.

00:11:45.286 --> 00:11:49.207
To be a good performer, one must study life closely, don't you think?

00:11:49.287 --> 00:11:50.368
That much is true.

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:51.775
You certainly know how to act.

00:11:52.008 --> 00:11:53.663
Sometimes I can't figure you out at all,

00:11:54.208 --> 00:11:56.464
never know if you mean something or if you're faking it.

00:11:59.368 --> 00:12:02.944
A clever woman must maintain an air of mystery.

00:12:03.368 --> 00:12:05.783
Being too open leaves you vulnerable.

00:12:07.647 --> 00:12:12.263
Long live the Princess! Long live the Princess!

00:12:12.527 --> 00:12:14.424
Hello, people!

00:12:22.488 --> 00:12:23.783
Xiao Yan Zi?

00:12:27.448 --> 00:12:28.561
Xiao Yan Zi!

00:12:29.248 --> 00:12:30.383
Xiao Yan Zi!

00:12:30.767 --> 00:12:32.023
Xiao Yan Zi!

00:12:32.927 --> 00:12:34.544
Xiao Yan Zi!

00:12:36.766 --> 00:12:38.543
Xiao Yan Zi!

00:12:38.887 --> 00:12:40.424
She is not a princess!

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.617
She is not a princess!

00:12:45.488 --> 00:12:46.601
Assassin!

00:12:47.488 --> 00:12:49.064
She's not the real princess!

00:12:49.407 --> 00:12:52.424
Here it comes, the iconic scene of "My Fair Princess"!
