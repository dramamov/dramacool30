HEROES NEXT DOOR

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:42.856
THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION.
ALL CHARACTERS, PROFESSIONS, PLACES,

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:43.857
COMPANIES, ORGANIZATIONS,
ETHNIC GROUPS AND EVENTS ARE NOT REAL.

00:00:43.941 --> 00:00:45.067
ALL CHILD AND ANIMAL SCENES WERE FILMED
SAFELY UNDER EXPERT SUPERVISION.

00:03:55.716 --> 00:03:58.010
It's me. The site is clear.

00:03:58.385 --> 00:03:59.720
The kids are heading to the ground floor.

00:03:59.803 --> 00:04:01.388
Check the outside.

00:04:15.736 --> 00:04:17.904
Sierra-Kilo. The outside is clear.

00:04:18.155 --> 00:04:19.698
The kids have arrived on the ground floor.

00:04:19.781 --> 00:04:21.241
The man with the backpack is on the move.

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:41.678
Dad.

00:04:45.432 --> 00:04:46.516
Do-yeon.

00:04:49.478 --> 00:04:50.562
Dad.

00:04:51.855 --> 00:04:52.981
Do-yeon!

00:04:53.482 --> 00:04:54.650
Dad!

00:04:56.234 --> 00:04:57.527
Daddy!

00:05:00.697 --> 00:05:01.531
Dad.

00:05:02.115 --> 00:05:03.075
Do-yeon!

00:05:05.118 --> 00:05:06.244
Oh, gosh.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.372
Wait.

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.876
Why were you sleeping in my room?

00:05:16.171 --> 00:05:19.549
My poor daddy. Is Mom mad at you again?

00:05:20.342 --> 00:05:21.551
Poor guy.

00:05:21.635 --> 00:05:24.638
No, I came to see you

00:05:24.721 --> 00:05:26.139
and fell asleep.

00:05:27.474 --> 00:05:29.393
Are you not feeling well?

00:05:34.147 --> 00:05:37.484
No, I'm not. My stomach hurts.

00:05:37.776 --> 00:05:39.820
Because you're so heavy.

00:05:53.041 --> 00:05:54.793
Let's get up now.

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.004
We have to get up
and get you to kindergarten.

00:05:57.462 --> 00:06:00.007
- Get washed up.
- Okay.

00:06:10.934 --> 00:06:15.105
An ATM booth in Kiyun-si
exploded late last night,

00:06:15.188 --> 00:06:18.400
BUTANE GAS, MY ASS
killing a foreigner inside the booth.

00:06:18.483 --> 00:06:20.110
The police said he purchased butane gas

00:06:20.193 --> 00:06:22.154
at a nearby convenience store,

00:06:22.237 --> 00:06:25.115
then entered the ATM booth,
which immediately exploded violently.

00:06:25.198 --> 00:06:27.242
The said ATM booth has been
completely destroyed.

00:06:27.534 --> 00:06:31.371
Two civilians nearby sustained
minor injuries from flying particles.

00:06:31.622 --> 00:06:34.791
The victim recently arrived in Korea
on a short-term visa

00:06:34.875 --> 00:06:36.710
- and had been working at a factory
- My goodness.

00:06:36.793 --> 00:06:38.378
- on the outskirts of Kiyun-si...
- You're lucky you're fine.

00:06:38.754 --> 00:06:41.423
You were supposed to take out the trash.
What were you even doing?

00:06:41.757 --> 00:06:43.717
I told you I was just on a walk.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.552
How could I have expected an explosion?

00:06:46.303 --> 00:06:48.347
What a disaster. And we just moved.

00:06:49.056 --> 00:06:51.350
Invite your colleagues
for a housewarming party.

00:06:52.184 --> 00:06:53.352
A housewarming party?

00:06:53.477 --> 00:06:56.563
If the Sullivan case closes,
and the housing prices flop...

00:06:57.856 --> 00:07:01.860
Anyway, you have to keep your job
until Do-yeon goes to college.

00:07:01.944 --> 00:07:05.572
I'll host a housewarming party
and impress your supervisors.

00:07:06.823 --> 00:07:08.450
That sounds like a grand plan.

00:07:08.533 --> 00:07:12.037
I thought you just wanted
to interrogate my colleagues.

00:07:14.665 --> 00:07:17.542
Shall I start yet another fun day
of winning that bread?

00:07:38.021 --> 00:07:39.815
Butane gas, my ass.

00:07:46.905 --> 00:07:49.783
They have power over news outlets
and even mobilized the military.

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:51.702
ARMY18 8285
Could he have been a runaway soldier?

00:07:52.327 --> 00:07:55.372
A foreigner with a muffled gun,
an MK 2 at that.

00:07:55.455 --> 00:07:57.332
Is he a terrorist? In Korea?

00:07:57.833 --> 00:07:59.876
Or a deserter?

00:08:00.836 --> 00:08:03.672
In just a few hours,
they cleaned up everything,

00:08:04.047 --> 00:08:05.924
determined the cause of the explosion,

00:08:06.883 --> 00:08:09.136
and even brought new ATMs.

00:08:10.012 --> 00:08:12.848
Hooray to Korea.

00:08:13.432 --> 00:08:16.560
No country is faster than ours.
Isn't that right?

00:08:16.935 --> 00:08:18.312
No, it's not.

00:08:19.271 --> 00:08:21.356
All of this is so suspicious to me.

00:08:23.108 --> 00:08:24.735
It's suspiciously fast, indeed.

00:08:25.902 --> 00:08:27.779
Do you remember the color of the flame

00:08:28.864 --> 00:08:30.324
when the explosion went off last night?

00:08:31.283 --> 00:08:32.701
The color of the flame?

00:08:33.035 --> 00:08:34.661
Flames can have all sorts of colors.

00:08:34.745 --> 00:08:36.496
Was it red or yellow?

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:39.249
I panicked and immediately ducked.

00:08:39.333 --> 00:08:40.959
How could I have seen the color?

00:08:41.043 --> 00:08:42.169
I need to get to work.

00:08:42.836 --> 00:08:47.090
Right, only soldiers from major units
know the color difference.

00:08:47.174 --> 00:08:51.511
But you didn't even serve in the military,
so how would you know?

00:08:58.644 --> 00:09:01.021
Butane gas, my ass.

00:09:05.233 --> 00:09:06.485
REPORT ON THE ACCIDENT
AT THE KIYUN INTERSECTION

00:09:10.572 --> 00:09:12.074
HWANG SEOG-WAN, AGE 41,
DELIVERYMAN, PART-TIME STORE EMPLOYEE...

00:09:15.202 --> 00:09:17.579
Good morning, Saint Choi.

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.958
I'm fine, thank you, and you?

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:22.918
Fine, thank you.

00:09:24.378 --> 00:09:25.629
What a surprise.

00:09:25.712 --> 00:09:27.464
You finished yesterday's report
without trouble.

00:09:30.926 --> 00:09:33.637
You face. Did you get into a fight?

00:09:34.221 --> 00:09:35.514
Did your wife beat you?

00:09:35.597 --> 00:09:37.182
Didn't you see the news?

00:09:37.265 --> 00:09:39.267
About the butane gas explosion
at the Kiyun Intersection.

00:09:39.559 --> 00:09:42.938
I was there.
This is my scar from surviving.

00:09:43.021 --> 00:09:44.690
You were on the news?

00:09:45.023 --> 00:09:46.900
What a celebrity.

00:09:47.859 --> 00:09:50.862
That neighborhood is so chaotic.

00:09:50.946 --> 00:09:53.740
A car explosion one night,
then a butane gas explosion the next?

00:09:53.991 --> 00:09:56.952
What is all this mess?

00:09:58.328 --> 00:09:59.621
They let this kid out.

00:09:59.705 --> 00:10:01.290
Which kid?

00:10:01.957 --> 00:10:03.583
The guy who ran over Sullivan's daughter.

00:10:04.042 --> 00:10:06.461
I saw it coming, as he's the son
of the Speaker of the National Assembly,

00:10:06.545 --> 00:10:08.922
and of course, he's off the hook.

00:10:09.006 --> 00:10:10.424
No surprise there.

00:10:10.507 --> 00:10:11.550
Is the final verdict out?

00:10:11.633 --> 00:10:12.676
Yes, just now.

00:10:14.469 --> 00:10:17.681
Law and order, my ass.

00:10:17.764 --> 00:10:18.807
JAMES SULLIVAN CASE FINAL VERDICT

00:10:21.727 --> 00:10:24.062
SUPREME COURT RULES MR. KWON AS NOT GUILTY

00:10:25.939 --> 00:10:27.107
I'm doomed.

00:10:27.858 --> 00:10:29.443
He's coming!

00:10:29.568 --> 00:10:30.694
- He's coming!
- He's out!

00:10:31.194 --> 00:10:32.154
- Excuse me!
- Hello?

00:10:32.237 --> 00:10:34.489
- Over here!
- A word, please!

00:10:35.824 --> 00:10:37.951
How do you feel about the final verdict?

00:10:38.035 --> 00:10:40.245
Are you planning to file a civil suit?

00:10:46.168 --> 00:10:49.338
Do you plan on a financial retaliation
by scrapping your investment plans, then?

00:10:55.052 --> 00:10:59.139
Everyone, is Korea all about money?

00:11:01.183 --> 00:11:02.017
Let's go.

00:11:04.019 --> 00:11:06.271
FRUSTRATED JAMES SULLIVAN SAYS,
"THERE'S NO JUSTICE IN KOREA"

00:11:06.355 --> 00:11:08.815
REAL ESTATE TREND READERS
James Sullivan purchased

00:11:08.899 --> 00:11:12.402
a huge plot in Kiyun-si
to build an Asian hub in Korea.

00:11:12.736 --> 00:11:14.780
Yes, which led the government to announce

00:11:14.863 --> 00:11:17.991
a plan to build the biggest special zone
for IT tourism in Asia.

00:11:18.075 --> 00:11:21.453
But the final verdict today.
My goodness, what will they do now?

00:11:21.536 --> 00:11:25.290
Why would he want to invest in a country
that freed the man who killed his kid?

00:11:25.374 --> 00:11:26.750
I'd never do that if I were him.

00:11:26.833 --> 00:11:29.878
So what will happen to the small investors
who invested everything they had now?

00:11:29.962 --> 00:11:31.088
Exactly.

00:11:31.171 --> 00:11:34.508
Won't the plan for the specialized zone
become nothing once Sullivan pulls out?

00:11:34.591 --> 00:11:38.470
That's just a blow to the small investors
who trusted the government.

00:11:38.887 --> 00:11:39.763
Those poor folks.

00:11:39.846 --> 00:11:41.014
VEOTIGO INSURANCE

00:11:43.809 --> 00:11:45.727
Have you found the car involved
in the Kiyun Intersection accident?

00:11:46.228 --> 00:11:49.106
It's at the public junkyard.
I'm heading there now.

00:11:49.189 --> 00:11:52.484
Not our client's car.
I'm asking about the other car.

00:11:52.901 --> 00:11:55.028
I'll find it, no matter what.

00:11:55.112 --> 00:11:57.406
Don't go anywhere and just wait.

00:11:57.489 --> 00:12:00.575
As expected of our ace.
That was pretty cool.

00:12:01.994 --> 00:12:04.329
- Am I cool?
- Yes.

00:12:04.621 --> 00:12:05.872
- Am I?
- Yes.

00:12:08.166 --> 00:12:10.294
My wife wants to set a date
for a housewarming party.

00:12:10.377 --> 00:12:12.796
Sounds great.
Announce it in the company group chat.

00:12:13.672 --> 00:12:15.340
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

00:12:17.509 --> 00:12:20.846
BONGBONG JUNKYARD

00:12:20.929 --> 00:12:23.849
What? Why wouldn't the other car be here?

00:12:24.349 --> 00:12:26.560
Why do you think? It's just not here.

00:12:26.643 --> 00:12:28.895
But the record says
that this place scrapped the cars.

00:12:28.979 --> 00:12:30.981
There should be two cars, then.
Why is there only one?

00:12:31.064 --> 00:12:32.232
Just show it to me already.

00:12:32.316 --> 00:12:35.027
I don't know about the car
that hit the victim's car.

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:36.403
We only got the victim's car.

00:12:37.821 --> 00:12:39.239
That makes no sense.

00:12:39.906 --> 00:12:42.117
You must know something.
You were there on site.

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.452
Just tell me.

00:12:43.827 --> 00:12:47.247
Why are you pestering me?
I'm busy! I don't know anything!

00:12:49.124 --> 00:12:51.084
Go that way, turn left,

00:12:51.168 --> 00:12:53.378
and you'll see a car
with shattered windows.

00:12:53.462 --> 00:12:55.839
I don't know how it exploded,
but it's a total mess.

00:12:55.922 --> 00:12:57.257
Check that and go.

00:13:27.412 --> 00:13:28.914
I wasn't the driver,

00:13:28.997 --> 00:13:33.168
but I dove into a huge fire of ashes
to save others--

00:13:33.835 --> 00:13:35.087
A fire of ashes.

00:13:35.879 --> 00:13:36.838
Watch out!

00:13:42.552 --> 00:13:44.012
Were they both bombs?

00:14:19.423 --> 00:14:20.674
Man...

00:14:20.966 --> 00:14:23.093
What the hell am I doing at this hour?

00:14:23.176 --> 00:14:24.886
My knees.

00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:27.347
Where did they go?

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:31.184
Gunshots?

00:14:39.818 --> 00:14:42.237
I definitely heard gunshots.

00:14:59.296 --> 00:15:02.007
I knew it. I was right.

00:15:02.257 --> 00:15:04.509
That sneaky rascal.

00:15:05.927 --> 00:15:07.346
He thought he could fool me.

00:15:27.532 --> 00:15:30.243
You little rascal, show me your face.

00:15:32.746 --> 00:15:34.539
What? He's covered here, too?

00:15:41.546 --> 00:15:43.882
How does this make any sense?

00:15:43.966 --> 00:15:48.095
A can of butane gas from a shop
caused an explosion, leading to a death

00:15:48.178 --> 00:15:49.596
and extensive damage to the building.

00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:55.102
And most importantly,
the locals are terrified.

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:58.814
Therefore, I will file a strong complaint

00:15:58.897 --> 00:16:00.774
to the butane gas manufacturer...

00:16:01.441 --> 00:16:03.860
What nonsense is she saying?

00:16:03.944 --> 00:16:07.823
I know. Someone died.
That's the most important thing here.

00:16:07.906 --> 00:16:09.324
She's saying we're terrified.

00:16:09.408 --> 00:16:12.577
Clearly, that explosion
made her mouth explode, too.

00:16:12.661 --> 00:16:14.538
She's having a blast, yapping away.

00:16:14.913 --> 00:16:16.623
- Who's that?
- Oh, my.

00:16:16.707 --> 00:16:18.417
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:16:19.084 --> 00:16:21.461
She's Na Eun-jae, a congresswoman.

00:16:21.878 --> 00:16:23.463
You don't have work today?

00:16:23.547 --> 00:16:25.048
- I'm out on business.
- I see.

00:16:25.132 --> 00:16:27.509
I was told I could meet Officer Park here.

00:16:27.592 --> 00:16:30.929
Officer Park? That's him.

00:16:31.013 --> 00:16:32.180
- I see.
- Yes.

00:16:32.556 --> 00:16:33.640
What are they doing?

00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:36.518
No idea. Just to yap, probably.

00:16:36.977 --> 00:16:40.480
If the butane gas was the issue,
she should've gone to the manufacturer.

00:16:40.564 --> 00:16:42.733
Why is she yapping away here?

00:16:42.816 --> 00:16:45.402
She's just trying to help
as a congresswoman.

00:16:45.485 --> 00:16:47.070
Be a bit nicer.

00:16:47.154 --> 00:16:50.198
Exactly. How is she trying to help?

00:16:50.282 --> 00:16:52.326
It's not like she's doing
what really needs to be done.

00:16:54.578 --> 00:16:57.039
Excuse me!

00:16:57.414 --> 00:16:58.457
Hey.

00:16:58.915 --> 00:17:02.336
Instead of stating the obvious,

00:17:02.419 --> 00:17:05.589
can you install some security cameras
with our tax money?

00:17:05.672 --> 00:17:07.674
People say security cameras
are everywhere in Korea,

00:17:07.758 --> 00:17:09.926
but we only have
a handful in our neighborhood.

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:12.304
- Yes, we need one at the intersection.
- There are barely any.

00:17:14.181 --> 00:17:15.015
And you are?

00:17:15.474 --> 00:17:17.017
Me?

00:17:20.354 --> 00:17:22.439
The 58th graduating class
of Kiyun Women's High School

00:17:22.522 --> 00:17:24.524
and head of the Women's Association
of Changri-dong.

00:17:24.608 --> 00:17:29.154
You shook my hand at my store
during the elections.

00:17:30.113 --> 00:17:35.744
I was just about to talk about that.

00:17:36.203 --> 00:17:39.873
We'll establish a strong security system
to prevent this from recurring

00:17:39.957 --> 00:17:42.250
and install smart security cameras

00:17:42.334 --> 00:17:45.629
that can predict potential danger
and send alerts.

00:17:46.129 --> 00:17:48.799
- So, the newest model of cameras?
- Yes, good ones.

00:17:48.882 --> 00:17:50.509
- Indeed.
- I see.

00:17:50.592 --> 00:17:54.221
On top of that,

00:17:55.263 --> 00:17:58.684
I'll make sure
to hold people legally accountable

00:17:59.101 --> 00:18:02.062
for the unfortunate incidents
that have recently happened in Kiyun-si.

00:18:02.396 --> 00:18:03.480
Ma'am,

00:18:03.814 --> 00:18:05.357
it's time for your next appointment.

00:18:07.484 --> 00:18:09.444
- She's leaving?
- Is she?

00:18:09.528 --> 00:18:10.612
Oh, my.

00:18:10.904 --> 00:18:12.531
- She's leaving.
- She's already leaving.

00:18:13.323 --> 00:18:16.827
She didn't stutter once.
Someone else definitely wrote her speech.

00:18:17.452 --> 00:18:19.246
She was always good at memorizing things.

00:18:31.216 --> 00:18:32.426
What a bitch.

00:18:34.344 --> 00:18:37.597
She thought
she was all that in high school,

00:18:37.681 --> 00:18:40.392
and now, she's just the head
of the Women's Association.

00:18:43.895 --> 00:18:45.480
Minister Kim is on the phone.

00:18:45.564 --> 00:18:46.440
KIM SEOK-JUN

00:18:47.691 --> 00:18:48.650
Yes?

00:18:49.526 --> 00:18:51.528
I've patched things up for now.

00:18:52.613 --> 00:18:53.739
Go ahead.

00:18:57.326 --> 00:18:59.369
Butane gas? Are you serious?

00:18:59.703 --> 00:19:01.747
It'd sound questionable to anyone!

00:19:02.331 --> 00:19:03.957
Who distributed the press release?

00:19:07.586 --> 00:19:11.548
Sir, you need to tell me at least
how bad it is

00:19:11.632 --> 00:19:14.593
so I can act accordingly.

00:19:17.679 --> 00:19:20.057
Stupid bastard in uniform.

00:19:22.184 --> 00:19:23.101
Let's go.

00:19:24.269 --> 00:19:25.896
MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE

00:19:25.979 --> 00:19:29.441
Man, she can blabber on forever.

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:32.235
How am I supposed to know
how bad it is already?

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:34.571
What a little brat.

00:19:40.911 --> 00:19:44.247
Everyone is talking about
Mr. Sullivan's post-trial comment.

00:19:44.831 --> 00:19:47.376
Today, the Supreme Court ruled

00:19:47.459 --> 00:19:51.463
Mr. Kwon, the defendant in the case
of Charlotte Sullivan's car crash,

00:19:51.546 --> 00:19:53.465
not guilty.

00:20:01.848 --> 00:20:03.433
Okay, all done.

00:20:24.746 --> 00:20:27.207
Hey! Why aren't you reading my messages?

00:20:29.084 --> 00:20:30.544
I didn't see your message.

00:20:49.646 --> 00:20:50.897
Are you an introvert?

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:53.025
My personality?

00:21:00.032 --> 00:21:01.199
Are you an extrovert?

00:21:04.703 --> 00:21:05.746
You're spot-on.

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:08.582
Aren't you at school? What's up?

00:21:09.458 --> 00:21:11.335
What book are we using for our lessons?

00:21:12.794 --> 00:21:15.422
I'll get it for you. See you tomorrow.

00:21:15.505 --> 00:21:16.548
Have a good day.

00:21:18.759 --> 00:21:19.801
Yes, sir.

00:21:20.135 --> 00:21:22.846
I'LL GET IT FOR YOU.
SEE YOU TOMORROW. HAVE A GOOD DAY.

00:21:23.013 --> 00:21:26.933
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight!

00:21:27.017 --> 00:21:30.812
Two, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight!

00:21:30.896 --> 00:21:34.858
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight!

00:21:34.942 --> 00:21:38.695
Two, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight!

00:21:38.779 --> 00:21:39.947
This way!

00:21:44.826 --> 00:21:46.787
Left, right, down, up!

00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:48.705
Left, right, down, up!

00:21:50.165 --> 00:21:51.166
Kick!

00:21:51.375 --> 00:21:53.460
- Special combat martial arts!
- Special combat martial arts!

00:21:53.543 --> 00:21:57.130
I love you, baby

00:21:57.214 --> 00:21:58.840
I don't know the next lyrics!

00:22:01.134 --> 00:22:02.511
Let's go!

00:22:08.558 --> 00:22:10.185
BUILDING STRONG BODIES WITH HARD TRAINING

00:22:12.396 --> 00:22:13.397
Everyone, sit.

00:22:16.275 --> 00:22:19.194
Can you all hear my cool voice?

00:22:19.278 --> 00:22:20.821
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:22:20.904 --> 00:22:22.197
I can't hear you!

00:22:25.033 --> 00:22:26.243
Right on.

00:22:26.326 --> 00:22:29.913
Let's say you're having fun
all by yourself at the playground,

00:22:30.372 --> 00:22:32.666
and an adult you've never seen
approaches you

00:22:32.749 --> 00:22:36.962
and says, "Hey, I'm your dad's friend.

00:22:37.045 --> 00:22:39.881
I'll buy you something yummy.
You want to come with me?"

00:22:39.965 --> 00:22:41.049
What are you supposed to say?

00:22:41.133 --> 00:22:43.719
- "No!"
- "I'm not going!"

00:22:43.802 --> 00:22:44.928
Good job.

00:22:45.012 --> 00:22:49.266
But if your voice is too soft,
they might not hear you.

00:22:49.349 --> 00:22:50.767
In that case,

00:22:51.727 --> 00:22:53.854
blow the whistle. Go!

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:01.445
All right! Stop!

00:23:03.947 --> 00:23:05.115
Stop it!

00:23:06.074 --> 00:23:07.242
Good job.

00:23:07.534 --> 00:23:12.122
Then let's say that our class is over,
and you're on your way home by yourself.

00:23:12.205 --> 00:23:13.665
And an adult you don't know
comes and says,

00:23:13.749 --> 00:23:18.712
"Oh, gosh, your mother is very unwell.
Let me take you to the hospital."

00:23:18.795 --> 00:23:19.630
What do you say?

00:23:19.713 --> 00:23:25.052
- "What's wrong with Mom?"
- "Which hospital?"

00:23:25.135 --> 00:23:27.137
No, that's not it.

00:23:29.264 --> 00:23:30.349
Right on!

00:23:31.016 --> 00:23:33.310
Everyone, applaud Do-yeon!

00:23:33.393 --> 00:23:35.062
Good job, Do-yeon!

00:23:35.145 --> 00:23:37.064
You must blow the whistle, okay?

00:23:37.147 --> 00:23:38.523
Oh, my!

00:23:38.607 --> 00:23:40.525
- Hello, there.
- Hi.

00:23:40.609 --> 00:23:42.653
Do-yeon, you're the best.

00:23:45.864 --> 00:23:50.160
Dad, if I meet a bad adult,
I'll scare them with my whistle.

00:23:50.243 --> 00:23:53.205
Yes, make their ears bleed.

00:23:53.288 --> 00:23:54.122
Okay.

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:57.876
We have a new art teacher in kindergarten.
Her name's Olivia.

00:23:58.669 --> 00:24:00.087
- Olivia?
- Yes.

00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:03.006
"Blah, blah."
She only speaks in English, like this.

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:06.301
Oh, an English-speaking teacher
who goes, "Blah, blah"?

00:24:06.385 --> 00:24:07.219
Yes.

00:24:08.261 --> 00:24:09.471
You're so funny.

00:24:10.263 --> 00:24:11.098
Right.

00:24:11.181 --> 00:24:14.226
Mom is cranky today,
so don't ask her to play videos for you.

00:24:15.394 --> 00:24:17.396
But I'll buy you a sticker.

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:20.857
- Don't tell Mom, okay?
- Okay.

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:22.818
- It's a secret.
- Secret.

00:24:22.901 --> 00:24:24.611
- Blah, blah.
- Blah, blah.

00:24:29.783 --> 00:24:31.952
- Hello, everyone.
- Hey.

00:24:32.035 --> 00:24:33.370
- Salute.
- Hello.

00:24:33.453 --> 00:24:34.746
Salute.

00:24:36.206 --> 00:24:39.334
Officer Park,
how about we slap some caffeine into us?

00:24:39.418 --> 00:24:40.711
I'd have to arrest you for slapping.

00:24:40.794 --> 00:24:42.629
Sure, arrest me after we slap some in.

00:24:45.257 --> 00:24:48.135
Man, I'm so popular today.

00:24:48.218 --> 00:24:51.471
- Have a good day, everyone.
- Bye.

00:24:51.972 --> 00:24:54.224
CHANGRI POLICE STATION

00:24:56.351 --> 00:24:58.395
Did someone else come by to see you?

00:24:58.937 --> 00:25:02.399
I had to go to the ATM explosion site
for a congresswoman's press conference,

00:25:02.482 --> 00:25:05.152
and some guy came to ask endless questions
about the Kiyun Intersection accident.

00:25:05.235 --> 00:25:07.237
The Kiyun Intersection accident? Who?

00:25:07.821 --> 00:25:09.615
Someone from the SIU?

00:25:10.198 --> 00:25:12.701
Was he from the government?

00:25:13.035 --> 00:25:15.412
No, he was an investigator
for an insurance company.

00:25:16.163 --> 00:25:19.124
The guy who was with you
when the explosion happened.

00:25:20.917 --> 00:25:23.629
Oh, so that's his job? The See You Team?

00:25:25.672 --> 00:25:26.923
It's SIU.

00:25:27.007 --> 00:25:28.759
- Yes, SIU.
- Yes.

00:25:29.009 --> 00:25:29.926
So why are you here?

00:25:30.802 --> 00:25:32.929
Me? Well,

00:25:33.305 --> 00:25:35.682
I wanted to know more about the man
who died in the ATM booth.

00:25:35.766 --> 00:25:38.852
The police are in charge of it now,
so I don't know.

00:25:38.935 --> 00:25:40.604
The news says the case has been closed.

00:25:42.689 --> 00:25:43.523
I see.

00:25:46.151 --> 00:25:46.985
Hey,

00:25:47.819 --> 00:25:51.615
so, you don't have anything
that you only want to tell me?

00:25:52.783 --> 00:25:54.326
I want to tell you how to leave.

00:25:54.409 --> 00:25:56.161
Okay, have a good day.

00:25:56.244 --> 00:25:58.872
- Yes, you too.
- Thanks for the coffee.

00:25:59.414 --> 00:26:00.832
Please don't cause trouble.

00:26:07.506 --> 00:26:10.175
Byeong-gu! I didn't know we had customers.

00:26:11.051 --> 00:26:13.261
Hello. We were waiting for you.

00:26:13.345 --> 00:26:15.639
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did you have to wait for long?

00:26:15.722 --> 00:26:17.432
- No.
- No?

00:26:17.557 --> 00:26:18.850
All right.

00:26:19.977 --> 00:26:21.311
- Let's head in.
- Okay.

00:26:21.687 --> 00:26:23.772
You should put up a sign
when you're stepping out.

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:42.040
Do-yeon, choose what you want.

00:26:42.124 --> 00:26:43.959
- I'll be at the hardware store.
- Okay.

00:26:47.337 --> 00:26:48.380
A moment, please.

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:01.518
Sir.

00:27:06.732 --> 00:27:07.649
Now...

00:27:07.733 --> 00:27:10.652
You witnessed
the accident at the intersection, right?

00:27:11.153 --> 00:27:12.237
"Sir"?

00:27:15.324 --> 00:27:16.408
So?

00:27:16.742 --> 00:27:19.828
Do you remember anything
about the cars in the accident?

00:27:20.412 --> 00:27:21.622
I'd appreciate your cooperation.

00:27:21.705 --> 00:27:23.540
I was too baffled to remember anything.

00:27:23.624 --> 00:27:25.834
Maybe the guys remember something.

00:27:26.376 --> 00:27:29.254
They don't remember anything,
aside from the big explosion.

00:27:29.338 --> 00:27:31.048
So you've already spoken with them.

00:27:31.131 --> 00:27:33.759
You move pretty fast for someone
who didn't serve in the military.

00:27:36.219 --> 00:27:39.097
Did you maybe see the SUV driver
get transported to the hospital

00:27:39.181 --> 00:27:41.516
or see the license plate? Anything?

00:27:42.059 --> 00:27:43.518
Not sure.

00:27:43.602 --> 00:27:47.147
The explosion went off
when I was busy trying to save people,

00:27:47.814 --> 00:27:49.566
so I don't remember

00:27:50.275 --> 00:27:52.611
the license plate or anything.

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:54.905
I see.

00:27:55.948 --> 00:27:57.699
You watched the accident happen
from the start, right?

00:27:57.783 --> 00:27:59.952
I was there the whole time, so of course.

00:28:02.287 --> 00:28:04.039
I have a question for you, too.

00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:09.252
If you answer it,
maybe I'll remember something too.

00:28:12.297 --> 00:28:14.508
Sure, fire away.

00:28:19.388 --> 00:28:21.348
Did you really not hear
any gunshots yesterday?

00:28:21.682 --> 00:28:22.933
When you were chasing after the guy.

00:28:24.393 --> 00:28:25.769
Come on.

00:28:26.103 --> 00:28:28.021
Why don't you just say
you don't want to cooperate?

00:28:28.105 --> 00:28:30.357
What gunshots? What do you mean?

00:28:31.191 --> 00:28:32.901
I'll pay for the sticker there.

00:28:38.073 --> 00:28:41.493
I guess it's rusty or something.
It just doesn't work.

00:28:44.913 --> 00:28:46.248
What's that for?

00:28:48.792 --> 00:28:49.668
How much is it?

00:28:51.003 --> 00:28:52.838
It's 20,000 won. It's written right there.

00:28:52.921 --> 00:28:53.922
Right.

00:28:54.631 --> 00:28:55.966
You want it or not?

00:28:56.216 --> 00:28:57.968
Do you also give
a lifetime warranty on this?

00:28:58.343 --> 00:28:59.553
Don't be ridiculous.

00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:02.347
In what country do they offer
a lifetime warranty on screwdrivers?

00:29:02.848 --> 00:29:04.349
It's too expensive, then. I don't want it.

00:29:12.316 --> 00:29:13.150
Oh, my.

00:29:27.039 --> 00:29:33.045
HANNA LAUNDRY SERVICE

00:29:34.963 --> 00:29:38.884
My, my! I heard there was
a laundry master in Kiyun-si

00:29:38.967 --> 00:29:42.095
who could even straighten
the wrinkles on my face, and it's you!

00:29:42.888 --> 00:29:47.934
The more I see you, the more I realize
that your heart is as good as your looks.

00:29:48.018 --> 00:29:49.478
Oh, no, have you already caught on?

00:29:49.561 --> 00:29:51.271
Gosh, I guess I can't hide it.

00:29:51.355 --> 00:29:52.940
Nobody can fool me.

00:29:54.232 --> 00:29:58.028
You can take your time with these.
It's nothing urgent.

00:29:58.111 --> 00:29:59.988
- Sure, leave them there.
- Okay.

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:06.370
I guess you have to work until late
with so much work to do.

00:30:06.453 --> 00:30:09.623
Oh, this? This is for Ms. Lee.

00:30:09.706 --> 00:30:11.708
Her son just got a job.

00:30:11.792 --> 00:30:14.920
She asked me to wash it for his first day,
and I totally forgot.

00:30:15.212 --> 00:30:17.923
As you know,
things have been bad around here lately.

00:30:18.882 --> 00:30:21.760
It's been so hectic
since you moved here. I'm sorry.

00:30:21.843 --> 00:30:23.095
It's fine.

00:30:23.637 --> 00:30:24.721
Oh, right.

00:30:25.472 --> 00:30:29.893
According to Ms. Lee,
the man who died last night,

00:30:29.977 --> 00:30:32.854
could be the young man who lived
in Hyeonju Art Ville across the road.

00:30:34.439 --> 00:30:35.816
Wasn't he a foreigner?

00:30:35.899 --> 00:30:38.110
He was. That must've been why
she could identify him so easily.

00:30:38.652 --> 00:30:40.988
It's a very outdated building

00:30:41.738 --> 00:30:43.156
with so many vacant units.

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:44.449
Really?

00:30:45.993 --> 00:30:46.952
Thank you.

00:31:52.809 --> 00:31:55.979
What are you doing there? With that face?

00:31:56.188 --> 00:31:57.940
You almost gave me a heart attack.

00:32:00.275 --> 00:32:02.694
I got you.

00:32:03.195 --> 00:32:06.073
What now? What did I do wrong this time?

00:32:07.115 --> 00:32:11.912
The guilty always return to the scene.

00:32:12.037 --> 00:32:14.706
The guilty? Who? Oh, you?

00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:17.626
Don't act dumb.
You know we're talking about you.

00:32:18.085 --> 00:32:21.046
What are you looking for here, Mr. Choi?

00:32:21.463 --> 00:32:24.341
I'm looking for my health, okay?

00:32:24.925 --> 00:32:28.220
Walking prevents Alzheimer's and aging.

00:32:29.846 --> 00:32:30.889
What?

00:32:30.973 --> 00:32:33.308
Am I not allowed to take walks
in this neighborhood?

00:32:33.392 --> 00:32:34.601
Is there a fine for it?

00:32:37.104 --> 00:32:38.814
You're here to find the empty shell,
aren't you?

00:32:39.481 --> 00:32:40.941
What empty shell?

00:32:41.275 --> 00:32:44.278
I served in an intense unit
in the military,

00:32:44.361 --> 00:32:46.905
so I know a muffled gunshot
when I hear one.

00:32:47.531 --> 00:32:51.868
And there was a gunshot
when you were fighting the man here,

00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:55.872
meaning one of you fired a shot.

00:32:57.124 --> 00:32:59.793
It doesn't make any sense
that you weren't startled.

00:32:59.876 --> 00:33:01.628
Considering you didn't even serve
in the military.

00:33:02.546 --> 00:33:03.588
Do you have

00:33:06.341 --> 00:33:07.676
hearing problems?

00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:09.219
TSM.

00:33:09.678 --> 00:33:11.805
TS... What?

00:33:12.222 --> 00:33:14.349
That's so mean.

00:33:14.891 --> 00:33:18.395
The whole neighborhood would've woken up
if there had been a gunshot.

00:33:18.478 --> 00:33:20.814
I may not have served in the military,
but I know a gunshot when I hear one.

00:33:21.315 --> 00:33:22.566
Get out of my way. Let me keep walking.

00:33:22.649 --> 00:33:24.818
I told you it was a muffled gunshot.

00:33:27.237 --> 00:33:29.448
So you're going to act dumb the whole way?

00:33:30.073 --> 00:33:31.325
Sure, then.

00:33:31.575 --> 00:33:34.077
Let's see how long that lasts.

00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:37.914
Sure, let's see.

00:33:37.998 --> 00:33:41.418
I'm walking all the way to the end,
so look all you want.

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:46.340
And Mr. Hardware Store,
be careful at night.

00:33:46.798 --> 00:33:50.093
Sticking your face
into other people's faces at night

00:33:50.177 --> 00:33:53.180
is a form of assault, okay?

00:33:56.683 --> 00:33:59.478
What about my face?

00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:10.697
Hey.

00:34:12.491 --> 00:34:14.952
Why did he tell me to come so soon?
It's not even patrol time yet.

00:34:17.245 --> 00:34:19.456
Hey, lock the door and come.

00:34:19.539 --> 00:34:20.791
Why should I lock the door?

00:34:21.667 --> 00:34:23.085
It's something important.

00:34:26.546 --> 00:34:27.923
Do-yeon's father?

00:34:28.048 --> 00:34:29.257
Yes.

00:34:29.967 --> 00:34:32.844
There's something suspicious about him.

00:34:32.928 --> 00:34:36.598
Perhaps he's just especially athletic.

00:34:36.682 --> 00:34:38.392
He could just be a good runner.

00:34:38.475 --> 00:34:41.478
And it must be a coincidence
that he wasn't caught on camera.

00:34:41.561 --> 00:34:43.313
How could he have
intentionally avoided every angle?

00:34:43.397 --> 00:34:45.440
Sure, it could be a coincidence
the first time.

00:34:46.358 --> 00:34:49.528
But then I completely rearranged
the cameras.

00:34:49.611 --> 00:34:51.154
I was busy trying to save people,

00:34:51.863 --> 00:34:53.532
so I don't remember...

00:34:54.866 --> 00:34:56.243
And he avoided all the cameras again.

00:34:56.785 --> 00:34:58.620
I'm 100 percent sure now.

00:34:58.704 --> 00:35:00.539
He knew where the cameras were
and avoided them all.

00:35:00.622 --> 00:35:03.542
And he gets weird
every time I talk about guns.

00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:10.382
So I made a gun loading sound on purpose,

00:35:10.465 --> 00:35:12.968
and he tried to kill me in a flash.

00:35:14.469 --> 00:35:15.679
That's not all.

00:35:17.472 --> 00:35:18.515
Oh, gosh!

00:35:21.226 --> 00:35:23.395
Where did you get this?
I thought it was a real gun.

00:35:23.812 --> 00:35:25.188
It's a BB gun,

00:35:25.272 --> 00:35:27.232
but its material and weight
are identical to a real gun.

00:35:27.733 --> 00:35:30.569
See? You served in the military,
and even you fell for it.

00:35:30.652 --> 00:35:35.324
But he hasn't even served in the military,
yet he didn't even blink an eye.

00:35:35.616 --> 00:35:37.993
He could just be uninterested.

00:35:38.619 --> 00:35:41.705
I'm dead serious right now.

00:35:48.629 --> 00:35:51.089
I even found this on the site.

00:35:52.132 --> 00:35:53.216
What's this?

00:35:54.343 --> 00:35:56.094
This is a real bullet.

00:35:57.804 --> 00:35:59.681
So, I've concluded

00:36:03.185 --> 00:36:04.645
that Choi Kang is...

00:36:09.024 --> 00:36:10.442
a North Korean spy.

00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:13.070
A North Korean spy?

00:36:14.071 --> 00:36:14.905
Yes.

00:36:19.076 --> 00:36:22.913
So, Do-yeon's father
is a North Korean spy,

00:36:23.288 --> 00:36:24.831
and the man killed in the explosion

00:36:24.915 --> 00:36:26.875
was a secret agent
for the National Intelligence Service?

00:36:27.334 --> 00:36:28.669
It could be the other way around.

00:36:28.752 --> 00:36:30.545
Keep it quiet, okay?

00:36:32.047 --> 00:36:35.550
They cleaned up the ATM explosion
in just an hour,

00:36:35.759 --> 00:36:38.345
and news outlets announced
that it was a butane gas explosion.

00:36:38.428 --> 00:36:40.347
They're trying to cover this up.

00:36:42.474 --> 00:36:44.726
Butane gas doesn't explode like that.

00:36:45.268 --> 00:36:47.688
I think it was a bomb.

00:36:47.771 --> 00:36:49.606
- A bomb?
- That's right.

00:36:49.856 --> 00:36:52.526
Let's say you're right,
and the dead man is the spy.

00:36:52.818 --> 00:36:55.946
Then it would've been
a huge deal on the news.

00:36:56.488 --> 00:36:57.656
- Hey.
- Yes?

00:36:57.739 --> 00:36:59.616
Can foreigners work for the NIS?

00:37:02.035 --> 00:37:03.996
They have Asians working for the CIA, too.

00:37:04.079 --> 00:37:06.415
They need to keep up
with the global trends to stay undercover.

00:37:06.498 --> 00:37:10.210
Right, and there are lots of foreigners
getting Korean citizenship nowadays.

00:37:10.294 --> 00:37:12.129
- Exactly.
- But still,

00:37:12.838 --> 00:37:15.340
calling Mr. Choi
a North Korean spy is a bit...

00:37:15.424 --> 00:37:16.550
Hey!

00:37:17.676 --> 00:37:20.137
I served in the Headquarters
Intelligence Detachment.

00:37:20.304 --> 00:37:22.139
Just trust me on this.

00:37:22.889 --> 00:37:23.765
Follow me.

00:37:39.281 --> 00:37:40.282
Oh, right.

00:37:40.365 --> 00:37:43.160
According to Ms. Lee,
the man who died last night,

00:37:43.243 --> 00:37:46.330
could be the young man who lived
in Hyeonju Art Ville across the road.

00:37:46.413 --> 00:37:50.125
It's a very outdated building
with so many vacant units.

00:37:56.632 --> 00:37:59.301
I really don't think this is a good idea.

00:37:59.801 --> 00:38:02.846
It's not like we're stealing anything.
Let's just check.

00:38:06.683 --> 00:38:07.851
Here it is.

00:38:08.185 --> 00:38:09.478
Wait.

00:38:10.103 --> 00:38:12.064
Are you sure this is the house?

00:38:12.147 --> 00:38:15.150
You must be so hungry all the time
with your mind constantly running.

00:38:15.525 --> 00:38:16.985
Chun-bae said this was the house.

00:38:17.319 --> 00:38:18.195
Follow me.

00:38:20.405 --> 00:38:22.199
I really don't think this is a good idea.

00:38:31.124 --> 00:38:32.709
I think I hear a cat.

00:38:32.793 --> 00:38:35.212
Should we just peep through the window?

00:38:35.295 --> 00:38:36.380
Hold on.

00:38:51.395 --> 00:38:52.604
- Byeong-nam!
- Yes?

00:38:55.732 --> 00:38:56.608
What is it?

00:38:57.818 --> 00:38:58.652
How did you open it?

00:38:59.736 --> 00:39:02.155
I just opened it, like this.

00:39:03.156 --> 00:39:07.911
I know Korea is a very safe country,
but people should still lock their doors.

00:39:09.371 --> 00:39:10.414
Darn it.

00:39:12.332 --> 00:39:13.875
What's wrong?

00:39:13.959 --> 00:39:15.919
No shoes in the entryway.
I don't think there's anyone in.

00:39:17.004 --> 00:39:18.380
Why are you scared, then?

00:39:19.756 --> 00:39:21.133
You scared me.

00:39:21.466 --> 00:39:22.467
- Step aside.
- Okay.

00:39:23.218 --> 00:39:24.303
Are you going in?

00:39:24.761 --> 00:39:26.013
You said nobody was inside.

00:39:47.826 --> 00:39:49.870
What's all this?

00:40:09.389 --> 00:40:10.974
Oh, gosh!

00:40:11.808 --> 00:40:12.809
You said nobody was in.

00:40:12.893 --> 00:40:14.895
They don't wear shoes.

00:40:20.609 --> 00:40:21.610
Meow.

00:40:24.446 --> 00:40:25.530
Meow.

00:40:28.450 --> 00:40:30.327
- Go that way.
- Why?

00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:31.620
We don't have time.

00:40:32.371 --> 00:40:33.622
- Fine.
- Okay.

00:40:37.918 --> 00:40:39.294
All right.

00:41:12.619 --> 00:41:14.204
Gosh, what's this?

00:41:44.192 --> 00:41:45.611
So this smell was...

00:42:03.754 --> 00:42:04.838
What's that?

00:42:36.244 --> 00:42:39.665
Guys, everything is good here!

00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:43.335
Byeong-nam! Su-nam!

00:42:43.418 --> 00:42:45.545
I mean, Su-il! Let's get out of here!

00:42:45.629 --> 00:42:46.755
We have to leave!

00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:49.633
Byeong-nam, we have to hurry.

00:42:49.716 --> 00:42:51.218
Hold on!

00:42:55.681 --> 00:42:57.808
I think someone is here!

00:43:00.102 --> 00:43:02.896
The stuffed bunnies smell like bombs.

00:43:43.729 --> 00:43:46.148
Who are you guys? Who sent you?

00:44:26.104 --> 00:44:27.272
Hey, honey.

00:44:27.356 --> 00:44:28.982
I'm just taking a walk.

00:44:29.816 --> 00:44:32.402
The neighborhood is bigger than it seems.

00:44:34.613 --> 00:44:38.367
I just ran into some stray cats.

00:44:38.784 --> 00:44:40.243
Go ahead and sleep first.

00:44:40.327 --> 00:44:42.329
I'll head right back. Bye.

00:44:48.919 --> 00:44:51.463
What? What is he doing there?

00:44:51.546 --> 00:44:52.839
Do-yeon's father?

00:44:53.173 --> 00:44:55.425
I got you, you little rascal.

00:44:57.928 --> 00:44:59.972
Hey! Be quiet!

00:45:01.181 --> 00:45:02.307
- I'm sorry.
- What's that?

00:45:02.391 --> 00:45:03.517
- What?
- What's that?

00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:05.519
I just saw it inside and took it.

00:45:18.282 --> 00:45:19.283
Let me

00:45:21.410 --> 00:45:22.411
explain

00:45:25.455 --> 00:45:26.456
myself.

00:45:29.209 --> 00:45:32.421
HOTLINE FOR REPORTING NORTH KOREAN SPIES

00:45:34.715 --> 00:45:35.924
What is it that you want to say?

00:45:36.425 --> 00:45:38.218
Do something stupid,
and I'll report you immediately.

00:45:39.803 --> 00:45:42.222
Mr. Choi, are you a North Korean spy?

00:45:42.597 --> 00:45:43.515
A North Korean spy?

00:45:44.725 --> 00:45:48.895
Last night, you framed me
as some crazy guy who didn't recycle,

00:45:48.979 --> 00:45:50.147
and now, I'm a North Korean spy?

00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:52.399
I saw it all. Cut the nonsense.

00:45:52.482 --> 00:45:55.319
We filmed you leaving Unit 203 with this.

00:45:55.402 --> 00:45:58.030
Did you get the guy running away, too?
Let me see.

00:45:58.113 --> 00:45:59.781
Don't try to pull any tricks here.

00:46:00.490 --> 00:46:02.159
I'm not pulling tricks.

00:46:04.202 --> 00:46:05.454
Seriously.

00:46:07.664 --> 00:46:08.999
I think that guy

00:46:09.666 --> 00:46:10.751
is a North Korean spy.

00:46:15.339 --> 00:46:17.090
The insurance company
collects all information

00:46:17.174 --> 00:46:20.469
on car accidents, explosions,
and any other accidents. Why?

00:46:20.552 --> 00:46:22.846
Because the victims need compensation.

00:46:23.263 --> 00:46:24.556
Exactly.

00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:26.975
And an investigator for the SIU

00:46:27.059 --> 00:46:30.312
has a duty to investigate the fine details
of these accidents carefully.

00:46:30.395 --> 00:46:31.813
Stop changing the topic,

00:46:31.897 --> 00:46:34.524
and just tell me
why you went into Unit 203.

00:46:35.651 --> 00:46:38.362
I heard something from the laundry place
and went there to find evidence.

00:46:38.445 --> 00:46:39.613
What evidence?

00:46:40.656 --> 00:46:43.283
That he was a North Korean spy.

00:46:44.326 --> 00:46:46.536
To find something like a muffled pistol.

00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:47.704
See?

00:46:48.288 --> 00:46:49.581
You knew everything and acted dumb.

00:46:49.665 --> 00:46:52.084
You cheeky man.

00:46:52.167 --> 00:46:54.086
That was the key evidence
that he was a North Korean spy.

00:46:54.169 --> 00:46:55.712
I didn't want to split my reward
once I reported him as a spy.

00:46:55.796 --> 00:46:57.005
There's no way, okay?

00:46:57.089 --> 00:46:58.173
Me neither, okay?

00:46:59.883 --> 00:47:00.842
What's that?

00:47:00.926 --> 00:47:02.803
I panicked and took it from that place.

00:47:02.886 --> 00:47:04.805
I was a communications soldier.
Should I open it?

00:47:04.888 --> 00:47:06.890
Open what? You have to report it.

00:47:06.974 --> 00:47:08.684
Do as you wish.

00:47:09.393 --> 00:47:13.522
Stop changing the topic
and tell me why you went into Unit 203.

00:47:16.608 --> 00:47:17.859
GENERAL HWANG

00:47:24.366 --> 00:47:25.617
Can you believe this guy?

00:47:26.118 --> 00:47:28.036
Look at this, Yong-hui.

00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:29.162
Mr. Choi!

00:47:29.663 --> 00:47:31.873
No, I have to take this call.

00:47:32.249 --> 00:47:33.792
Of course, you must.

00:47:37.921 --> 00:47:40.882
We'll all die if I don't take this call.

00:47:47.264 --> 00:47:48.140
SPEAKER

00:47:48.974 --> 00:47:50.642
What took you so long to pick up?

00:47:51.393 --> 00:47:52.561
Why are you still out?

00:47:52.811 --> 00:47:53.854
Hey, honey.

00:47:54.479 --> 00:47:56.940
I'm at the convenience store
in front of our building after my walk.

00:47:57.858 --> 00:47:59.276
Do you realize what time it is?

00:47:59.735 --> 00:48:02.529
Come home already.
And get some milk on the way.

00:48:02.696 --> 00:48:03.655
Yes, ma'am.

00:48:11.705 --> 00:48:13.290
Forget being a North Korean spy.

00:48:13.373 --> 00:48:15.584
I have to go home with milk
so I can sleep.

00:48:17.961 --> 00:48:20.088
- Goodnight.
- Okay, goodnight.

00:48:24.051 --> 00:48:26.261
What should I do with this?
Should I report it?

00:48:26.345 --> 00:48:27.888
Or should I unlock it?
I think I can do it.

00:48:27.971 --> 00:48:29.765
No, that's dangerous.
I should turn it in, right?

00:48:29.848 --> 00:48:31.433
I want to open it, though. What a dilemma.

00:48:31.516 --> 00:48:33.477
- Are you Gollum?
- What?

00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:34.936
Why are you so hesitant?

00:48:35.187 --> 00:48:36.271
Just do as you wish.

00:48:37.814 --> 00:48:39.524
Don't forget this, Byeong-nam.

00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:42.319
I feel like I can open it.

00:48:42.653 --> 00:48:44.404
But I should turn it in. It's dangerous.

00:48:44.821 --> 00:48:46.740
What are you doing?

00:48:47.199 --> 00:48:48.992
Should I try opening it?

00:48:51.161 --> 00:48:53.747
MAMMOSEU MART

00:48:53.830 --> 00:48:56.166
TODAY'S SPECIAL SALE

00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:14.059
Hello.

00:49:21.441 --> 00:49:23.735
You have to finish this by next week.

00:49:26.863 --> 00:49:28.448
But your kid will finish it in no time.

00:49:34.329 --> 00:49:35.455
Hold on.

00:49:41.086 --> 00:49:44.006
These are for a promotional event.

00:49:44.339 --> 00:49:45.674
Take these and feed your kid.

00:49:45.757 --> 00:49:47.134
These won't expire for a long time.

00:49:47.217 --> 00:49:48.844
I'm really fine.

00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:52.723
Oh, my. Your baby is so calm.

00:49:52.806 --> 00:49:54.850
Gosh, you're not even crying, are you?

00:49:56.059 --> 00:49:57.269
Thank you.

00:49:58.520 --> 00:49:59.563
Have a good day.

00:50:02.733 --> 00:50:03.775
How adorable.

00:50:05.736 --> 00:50:07.904
- Hello.
- That's so sad.

00:50:09.197 --> 00:50:10.032
What?

00:50:11.241 --> 00:50:14.453
The woman with the baby who just left.

00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:16.538
Her husband died
in the intersection accident.

00:50:17.039 --> 00:50:19.249
She only ever buys products
that are on sale.

00:50:19.958 --> 00:50:22.294
Her kid is too young for her to work.

00:50:29.426 --> 00:50:30.510
Goodness.

00:50:32.137 --> 00:50:35.724
Are you visiting another hospital?

00:50:35.807 --> 00:50:38.685
No, I'm going to Bongbong Junkyard today.

00:50:40.646 --> 00:50:41.772
Bongbong Junkyard?

00:50:43.398 --> 00:50:44.691
So you lived in the neighborhood?

00:50:45.150 --> 00:50:47.235
You should've told me sooner.

00:50:47.778 --> 00:50:49.696
Hold up.

00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:51.156
Let's drink together.

00:50:57.871 --> 00:51:02.751
I've spoken with the police
and all witnesses at the crash site,

00:51:02.834 --> 00:51:04.503
and nobody knows
what happened to the other car.

00:51:04.586 --> 00:51:06.630
They don't even know
if the driver is still alive

00:51:06.713 --> 00:51:08.590
or how many people were in the car.

00:51:08.674 --> 00:51:09.675
Nobody knows anything.

00:51:09.758 --> 00:51:11.510
The tow truck guys said the same thing.

00:51:11.593 --> 00:51:13.804
All the tow truck guys
know each other in this area,

00:51:13.887 --> 00:51:15.973
but they didn't recognize
the tow truck guy from that accident.

00:51:16.056 --> 00:51:17.724
They went to the site when called,

00:51:17.808 --> 00:51:20.852
and they were mad someone beat them to it.

00:51:22.562 --> 00:51:25.524
Have they spoken to the driver?

00:51:25.774 --> 00:51:28.485
No, they all left the site
at different times

00:51:28.568 --> 00:51:30.696
and saw him on the way here.

00:51:31.446 --> 00:51:33.991
Apparently, he took the damaged car
and drove toward Hanbal Mountain.

00:51:35.117 --> 00:51:36.076
Is there anything there?

00:51:36.451 --> 00:51:38.120
It's a mountain. What do you expect?

00:51:38.537 --> 00:51:40.747
Nothing but tigers and lions!

00:51:44.918 --> 00:51:48.672
Oh, but there's a logistics center
in the mountain.

00:51:49.548 --> 00:51:52.676
What was it? Oh, man.

00:51:52.759 --> 00:51:53.635
Nobus?

00:51:53.802 --> 00:51:55.053
Something like that.

00:51:56.430 --> 00:51:57.556
"Nobus"?

00:51:59.057 --> 00:52:00.434
You mean the Nobus Logistics Center?

00:52:00.517 --> 00:52:02.728
Yes, that. Nobus.

00:52:02.811 --> 00:52:04.813
They load and unload trucks
in the Hanbal Mountain?

00:52:04.896 --> 00:52:06.648
No, it's just a warehouse.

00:52:06.732 --> 00:52:09.901
I went there once because
someone called about a car breaking down,

00:52:09.985 --> 00:52:11.028
but nobody was there.

00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:13.905
- And you're sure the truck went that way.
- Yes.

00:53:01.370 --> 00:53:03.288
Hello.

00:53:03.372 --> 00:53:05.916
- What is the purpose of your visit?
- Oh, well,

00:53:05.999 --> 00:53:08.251
I'm Choi Kang from Veotigo Insurance.

00:53:09.544 --> 00:53:13.757
I heard a car from a recent car crash
was brought here.

00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:15.342
Is it here?

00:53:15.425 --> 00:53:16.593
I cannot provide that information.

00:53:16.927 --> 00:53:18.845
This is private property,
so please go back.

00:53:19.763 --> 00:53:20.889
Oh, well...

00:53:21.765 --> 00:53:23.141
I'm sorry,

00:53:24.059 --> 00:53:26.853
but my bladder is about to explode.

00:53:26.937 --> 00:53:29.356
Could I just use your bathroom?

00:53:29.439 --> 00:53:30.524
I'm about to burst.

00:53:31.191 --> 00:53:33.443
It's private property.
You can't enter without permission.

00:53:34.111 --> 00:53:38.115
Okay, I'll just go in
and turn my car around, then.

00:53:39.074 --> 00:53:40.534
You can drive in reverse to exit.

00:53:41.410 --> 00:53:42.661
There's a car going out.

00:53:42.786 --> 00:53:43.954
Okay.

00:54:01.138 --> 00:54:02.472
What is this place?

00:54:02.556 --> 00:54:04.308

Careful. Good.

00:56:20.736 --> 00:56:23.655
He'll drop you guys off today.
See you tomorrow.

00:56:23.739 --> 00:56:25.699
- Martial arts!
- Martial arts!

00:56:27.034 --> 00:56:28.702
- Thanks. Drive safe!
- See you tomorrow.

00:56:35.417 --> 00:56:36.627
How come you didn't get in?

00:56:36.918 --> 00:56:38.587
Daddy is picking me up today.

00:56:38.670 --> 00:56:40.422
Is that so?

00:56:40.881 --> 00:56:44.676
And I put the stickers from your shop
on my bag.

00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:47.387
Great job, it looks wonderful.

00:56:48.972 --> 00:56:50.474
- Do-yeon!
- It's very pretty.

00:56:50.557 --> 00:56:52.309
Oh? It's Dad!

00:56:53.143 --> 00:56:54.478
Dad!

00:57:18.251 --> 00:57:19.211
Dad!

00:57:24.591 --> 00:57:25.550
Do-yeon!

00:57:41.108 --> 00:57:41.942
Do-yeon!

00:57:43.694 --> 00:57:45.988
Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere?

00:57:46.071 --> 00:57:47.155
Dad...

00:57:47.239 --> 00:57:48.865
You're fine. Daddy is here.

00:57:51.034 --> 00:57:52.035
Yes.

00:57:53.245 --> 00:57:54.371
Are you okay?

00:57:56.164 --> 00:57:57.624
That bastard...

00:58:01.670 --> 00:58:04.339
DREAM TREE STATIONERY

00:58:24.026 --> 00:58:25.360
You said you'd turn it in.

00:58:25.944 --> 00:58:27.529
Sorry.

00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:30.741
I was going to do that after checking it.

00:58:30.824 --> 00:58:33.368
But it's a special lock
that won't open easily.

00:58:33.619 --> 00:58:34.911
Why won't it open?

00:58:35.370 --> 00:58:38.915
I guess it must be something important

00:58:39.875 --> 00:58:41.543
for them to do something that crazy
in broad daylight to get it.

00:58:42.044 --> 00:58:45.756
Maybe it holds key evidence
for a crime that they must destroy.

00:58:47.049 --> 00:58:48.050
Is there no way to open it?

00:58:49.009 --> 00:58:50.052
Well...

00:58:51.011 --> 00:58:52.596
I guess there's a way.

00:58:52.679 --> 00:58:53.680
Really?

00:58:55.849 --> 00:58:56.975
What should we do?

00:58:57.059 --> 00:58:59.394
Why are you even asking?
Go big, or go home.

00:59:01.939 --> 00:59:04.232
I'm intrigued now. Let's open it.

00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:08.445
We're on the same boat now, then.

00:59:13.158 --> 00:59:14.076
Okay.

00:59:18.413 --> 00:59:19.414
Okay!

SUNLAB COMPUTER
ELECTRONIC SALES AND REPAIR

00:59:40.477 --> 00:59:42.729
This is Kim Seon-won,
who served in the military with me.

00:59:43.397 --> 00:59:44.731
They're buddies from my neighborhood.

00:59:45.482 --> 00:59:46.942
Hey, nice to meet you.

00:59:47.484 --> 00:59:48.652
Stop it.

00:59:48.735 --> 00:59:50.779
Can you take a look at this?

00:59:54.449 --> 00:59:55.534
It can't be cracked.

01:00:01.415 --> 01:00:02.249
Hold on.

01:00:14.594 --> 01:00:16.471
You know about the case

01:00:16.555 --> 01:00:19.683
where a military captain
tried to sell Korea's military information

01:00:19.766 --> 01:00:22.644
to a North Korean agent
in exchange for Bitcoins, right?

01:00:26.106 --> 01:00:29.234
Anyway, to hack the KGCCS system,

01:00:29.318 --> 01:00:32.738
he used a hacking device
in the form of a USB, Poison Tap.

01:00:33.697 --> 01:00:35.073
Then is that Poison Tap?

01:00:35.157 --> 01:00:36.366
I've only heard of it.

01:00:36.450 --> 01:00:38.577
No, that's outdated.

01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:42.414
This was inspired
by the Yongmu Gym manager here,

01:00:42.497 --> 01:00:43.790
Yongmu Number 17.

01:00:45.375 --> 01:00:46.376
Nice.

01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:48.962
Could you explain it in layman's terms
so I can understand?

01:00:49.212 --> 01:00:50.672
Come on.

01:00:52.758 --> 01:00:54.051
Well,

01:00:54.134 --> 01:00:56.345
this Yongmu Number 17

01:00:56.428 --> 01:00:59.598
is an upgraded version of Poison Tap.

01:00:59.890 --> 01:01:01.433
- You know what hacking is, right?
- Something bad.

01:01:02.934 --> 01:01:04.061
Yes, it's bad.

01:01:04.144 --> 01:01:07.105
It's a hacking device
in the form of a USB.

01:01:07.189 --> 01:01:08.941
I haven't tested it
on a satellite computer yet,

01:01:09.024 --> 01:01:10.525
but if it doesn't work,
I'll edit the source.

01:01:11.568 --> 01:01:12.569
But one thing.

01:01:13.153 --> 01:01:15.864
Please get as far as you can from here
before you use it.

01:01:15.948 --> 01:01:17.866
Don't put my shop at risk.

01:01:17.950 --> 01:01:20.786
Hey, of course I thought of that.
Hand it to me.

01:01:21.036 --> 01:01:25.165
No, let's just have you do it
while we're here.

01:01:25.248 --> 01:01:27.501
Have you no shame?

01:01:27.584 --> 01:01:30.587
He gave us a key to hack it.
We can't ask him to do more.

01:01:30.671 --> 01:01:31.755
Thanks to whom? Ask for what?

01:01:31.838 --> 01:01:33.131
- Why are we here, then?
- Let's go.

01:01:33.215 --> 01:01:35.175
- Just turn it on for us.
- Just trust us.

01:01:35.258 --> 01:01:36.843
- Read the room.
- I'll try it

01:01:36.927 --> 01:01:38.261
and call you if it doesn't work.

01:01:38.345 --> 01:01:39.972
How can I read the room
when you're being so vague?

01:01:40.055 --> 01:01:41.264
Just go, okay?

01:01:41.890 --> 01:01:42.975
Goodnight.

01:01:43.392 --> 01:01:44.393
Bye.

01:02:01.201 --> 01:02:03.328
- It worked.
- It's on.

01:02:03.745 --> 01:02:04.705
Hurry.

01:02:17.676 --> 01:02:20.012
But what's with the screen?

01:02:20.095 --> 01:02:22.556
Did you expect it
to look like a normal computer?

01:02:22.889 --> 01:02:24.516
Fine, just do your thing. Hurry.

01:02:25.309 --> 01:02:26.727
Let's see what's in it.

01:02:31.773 --> 01:02:32.774
Let's see.

01:02:35.152 --> 01:02:36.320
What's this?

01:02:36.403 --> 01:02:38.238
That looks like the Kiyun Intersection.

01:02:38.322 --> 01:02:40.574
You're right.

01:02:40.657 --> 01:02:42.242
It's from that accident.

01:02:42.701 --> 01:02:43.952
You're right.

01:02:44.202 --> 01:02:46.204
Look at that.

01:02:47.664 --> 01:02:51.627
The guys and I were sitting over there.

01:02:51.710 --> 01:02:52.753
See that?

01:03:00.344 --> 01:03:02.679
Oh, man. My stomach is in pain
from all that anxiety.

01:03:02.763 --> 01:03:04.723
- I need to use the bathroom.
- Go ahead.

01:03:05.098 --> 01:03:06.516
- I have to do it again.
- Do what again?

01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:08.602
- I have to start over.
- Rewind the video!

01:04:34.187 --> 01:04:35.314
Who sent you here?

01:04:35.772 --> 01:04:37.691
Kamas? BIJ?

01:04:38.025 --> 01:04:38.984
Tell me.

01:04:54.333 --> 01:04:57.544
So, the car crash
at the Kiyun Intersection

01:04:57.628 --> 01:04:59.546
and the ATM explosion

01:04:59.630 --> 01:05:02.674
were plotted by the same person?

01:05:03.175 --> 01:05:06.219
All the files are in English,
and the man who died was a foreigner.

01:05:06.303 --> 01:05:08.847
Could this be
the work of an international mafia?

01:05:08.930 --> 01:05:10.098
An international mafia?

01:05:10.599 --> 01:05:11.892
My gosh, this is...

01:05:11.975 --> 01:05:13.018
Did you find anything?

01:05:13.101 --> 01:05:14.686
Did you fall into the toilet or what?

01:05:14.770 --> 01:05:17.147
Oh, my! Blood!

01:05:17.230 --> 01:05:18.815
Blood!

01:05:20.192 --> 01:05:22.194
The guy on the motorbike came after us.

01:05:22.277 --> 01:05:24.404
Did you find anything
aside from the video of the accident?

01:05:25.197 --> 01:05:27.741
We haven't checked all of it.

01:05:28.492 --> 01:05:30.118
Let's check them together.

01:05:30.744 --> 01:05:31.870
Yes.

01:05:34.373 --> 01:05:35.290
It's making a sound.

01:05:37.125 --> 01:05:40.587
Someone is controlling it remotely.

01:05:40.671 --> 01:05:41.672
Excuse me.

01:05:44.549 --> 01:05:45.384
Hold up.

01:05:53.225 --> 01:05:57.312
"You're making things complicated."

01:05:59.398 --> 01:06:00.899
"JDD...

01:06:02.025 --> 01:06:03.360
Special Operations Forces"?

01:06:04.152 --> 01:06:07.698
CHOI KANG

01:06:10.450 --> 01:06:13.912
"JDD Special Operations Forces"?

01:06:20.210 --> 01:06:21.253
They know me?

01:06:21.795 --> 01:06:25.424
YOU'RE MAKING THINGS COMPLICATED
JDD SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES, CHOI KANG

01:06:28.260 --> 01:06:31.346
CHOI KANG

01:07:13.764 --> 01:07:16.683
HEROES NEXT DOOR

01:07:16.933 --> 01:07:19.019
Why would any terrorist organization
want to target Kiyun?

01:07:19.102 --> 01:07:21.730
A bus exploded at the local bus garage.

01:07:21.813 --> 01:07:22.648
Let's go.

01:07:22.731 --> 01:07:25.943
How can there be so many accidents
in Changri-dong nonstop?

01:07:26.234 --> 01:07:27.736
Who would do such a thing?

01:07:28.946 --> 01:07:32.115
A truck came and cleaned the site.

01:07:32.199 --> 01:07:34.493
Military involvement in both cases.

01:07:34.576 --> 01:07:36.244
Someone seems to have tampered with it.

01:07:36.745 --> 01:07:38.830
I heard you're only deployed
on high-risk combat missions.

01:07:38.914 --> 01:07:41.667
He's much scarier than we thought.

01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:43.460
Look at how they recognized him
immediately.

01:07:45.921 --> 01:07:47.923
