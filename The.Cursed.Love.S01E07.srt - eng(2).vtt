♫Every time the old's replaced with a new one♫

♫Nothing's the same forever, it's all changed♫

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.200

♫My love for you never evanesces♫

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.440
I want to know what exactly happened.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.440
There's someone who knows that very well.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.720
Come closer and you'll die.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.560
Aunt Kate...

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.440
Kill him.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.680
If you'd been honest with my dad,

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.040
he wouldn't have had to die.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.760
I'm really sorry, Khunkhao.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.760
Professor!

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.600
Fetch me the Shiva lingam
and the Yoni stone!

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.520
Mom...

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.120
I used to be really mad at you

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.320
for loving and caring about Khun

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.720
more than me.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.680
I never knew

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.480
you were trying to make up

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.120
for taking Uncle Singkhon away from him.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.800
I'm sorry, Mom.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.360
I'm sorry

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.200
I made you live with that guilt

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.520
and let it haunt you.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.520
If I had known the truth,

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.680
I wouldn't have tried to compete with him

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.960
or done the terrible things I did.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.000
I wanted to tell you and Khun
the truth all along,

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.840
but I was afraid

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.680
that if I did, he would cut me off

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.840
and never let me take care of him again.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.160
He's already lost his dad.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.280
Without me,

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.099
what would his life be like?

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.820
I've always been terrified of this day.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:05.960
Right now,

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.840
I don't even know how to face him.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.560
Khunkhao.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.160
I misunderstood Michael,

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.000
thinking he murdered his friend.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.920
Aunt Kate should've been honest with me.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.840
We're family after all.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.560
If she had told you earlier,

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.360
would you still be this angry?

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.480
I would've cut ties with her right away.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.080
That's why she didn't tell you.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.080
She must've had no choice.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.092
Besides,

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.410
she's been trying
to make it up to you all this time.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.787
I don't even know

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.720
if I can ever
look at her the same way again.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:38.760
I honestly don't.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:54.800
I'm sorry.

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.240
I've misunderstood
your father all this time.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.136
What I said about him

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:05.360
must've hurt you.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.080
I'm glad to have you.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.240
Khun,

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.728
something serious happened.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:33.960
What is it?

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:41.880
I think...

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.440
I really have to go.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.360
Thara!

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.680
Where are you taking your mom?

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.772
Hey, take it easy, Khun.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.520
We're still one family, sweetie.

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:55.680
Where are you taking her?

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.040
I don't know,

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.240
but it's better than staying here
and making you feel uncomfortable.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:01.917
Don't try to think for me.

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:03.840
If I'm not okay, I'll tell you myself.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.240
- Easy, kids.
- Can you forgive my mom, then?

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.640
I lost my dad

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.572
and I lost my trust because of you.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.040
I don't even think

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.600
I'd ever be able to forgive you.

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.680
But if you took her away,

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:30.960
who would I have?

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:32.800
I've already lost my dad.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.520
I don't want to lose
anyone else in my family again.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.200
I'm sorry, Aunt Kate.

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.320
Please stay here with me.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.040
I'm begging you.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.360
We're still a family,

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.840
thanks to your forgiveness, Khun.

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.960
I'm sure Singkhon would be proud of you.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.240
Pudding,

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:23.320
that was such a great speech!

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.320
I'm so proud of you.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.360
Babe, you're amazing.

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:33.720
Are you so touched that you're crying?

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:36.560
The f*ck you mean? I'm not.

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.280
It's just dust.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.080
Someone as cool as me
isn't that sensitive.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.123
It used to hurt me

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:19.840
knowing that everyone loved him more

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.360
and that I was always second to him.

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.000
But now,

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:29.360
I finally see why he won.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.200
He didn't win you over.

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:35.040
He won over himself.

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:38.600
He overcame all his anger

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.240
with the love he has for his family.

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:44.600
Too cool, isn't he?

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.880
Just hearing that makes me realize
how completely I've lost.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.720
You and him are even.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.720
You embraced all of Aunt Kate's mistakes

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:03.040
and were willing to let go
of everything you hold dear.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.720
You'd go that far for Khunkhao.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.320
If I'm even with him for that,

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.560
what about the other matter?

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.504
Am I also even with him?

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.440
What do you mean by that?

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.230
It's Earth.

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:40.480
Pick it up.

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:44.280
Hello?

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.600
Professor Thakoon
has information about the rebellion

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.487
in Tambralinga

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.932
by the Four Benders,

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.840
if you're curious.

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:05.200
Well, then I'll come to you with Thara.

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:19.620
So...

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:21.840
if they know we're the Benders,

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.240
then what's their plan?

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:30.400
We'll need that information
to deal with Kalakal anyway.

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:32.280
We can't avoid him.

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:35.840
Then we must face him.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.480
What did they say?

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:06.960
Thara and Siwat will come here tonight.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.360
You may leave now.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:13.880
You're not going to team up with them
to kill Siwat, are you?

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.320
Leave.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.840
Thara said you guys
have something to tell me.

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:47.360
Please take this.

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:50.240
Hold on,

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.840
aren't you just going to see Thakoon?

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.400
Do you have to go this far?

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.680
Should I be worried?

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.160
I think he wants these two stones,

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:03.760
believing they're the key to the city.

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:06.840
I want to keep them safe

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:09.160
with someone I trust.

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:29.040
But he called us in,
knowing that the three of us possess powers.

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:31.680
I think he must have a plan to deal with us,

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:34.480
and I'm afraid we won't keep up.

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.200
Just to be safe, Mom.

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:39.400
See you all worried like this...

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:41.760
makes me uneasy.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:43.880
We'll be back as soon as possible.

00:13:52.507 --> 00:13:53.240
We're off.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.240
Be careful, okay?

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:45.160
If you're not out in 30 minutes,

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.200
I'm going in.

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:50.280
Thara,

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:51.800
take care of him for me.

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:53.000
Yeah, I already know that.

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:22.800
Hey, Earth!

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:26.640
Earth?

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.280
I'm sorry.

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:56.720
(Casting a spell)

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:16.240
Khun!

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:19.680
You're also here?!

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:22.480
Yeah, I want to know the info as well.

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:27.440
The three of them are still talking.

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:29.880
You should wait out here.

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:32.920
What did Thakoon do to them?

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:34.160
He...

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:35.640
Nothing.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:49.040
(Casting a spell)

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:54.760
(Casting a spell)

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:08.920
It's pathetic
seeing you all protecting each other.

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:11.520
No matter how hard you try to lie to us,

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:12.640
I won't buy it.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.560
Guess you'll have to see for yourselves.

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.398
(Casting a spell)

00:17:26.988 --> 00:17:29.228
This is a needle holder.

00:17:29.268 --> 00:17:32.428
Hold it with your thumb, index finger,
middle finger, and ring finger.

00:17:32.988 --> 00:17:35.548
Grasp the needle
at three-quarters of its length,

00:17:35.668 --> 00:17:37.108
then insert it at 90 degrees.

00:17:37.508 --> 00:17:38.988
Now, you try it.

00:17:42.508 --> 00:17:46.028
I can try it now, but I won't have the guts
when I actually have to do it.

00:17:46.388 --> 00:17:47.828
You have to practice anyway,

00:17:48.128 --> 00:17:50.508
so you'll be able to do it
when the time comes.

00:17:52.391 --> 00:17:53.508
Give it a try.

00:17:54.008 --> 00:17:56.708
So, if I can do it,

00:17:56.948 --> 00:17:58.428
will I get something in return?

00:17:59.628 --> 00:18:00.748
What do you want, then?

00:18:06.688 --> 00:18:07.868
Really?

00:18:10.248 --> 00:18:11.468
You need to do it first.

00:18:15.388 --> 00:18:17.668
What a lovey-dovey couple you are.

00:18:18.108 --> 00:18:19.188
Shut up, Pun.

00:18:19.228 --> 00:18:20.108
This is about girls.

00:18:20.668 --> 00:18:22.788
It's about girls. You're not one of them.

00:18:28.108 --> 00:18:28.828
Wait...

00:18:29.988 --> 00:18:30.628
What?

00:18:32.508 --> 00:18:33.308
Babe!

00:18:34.228 --> 00:18:35.468
What's going on?

00:18:35.628 --> 00:18:36.828
It's a gunshot.

00:18:38.348 --> 00:18:39.948
Call the police and Khunkhao now!

00:18:40.328 --> 00:18:41.988
And you two, stay inside.

00:18:42.028 --> 00:18:42.828
Do you need backup?

00:18:42.868 --> 00:18:44.388
- No, just rush into the house.
- Got it.

00:19:12.708 --> 00:19:13.548
Aunt Kate!

00:19:13.588 --> 00:19:14.508
- Stop!
- Aunt Kate...

00:19:15.108 --> 00:19:16.468
Still got that touch, huh?

00:19:17.548 --> 00:19:18.628
Aisoon.

00:19:25.028 --> 00:19:25.908
- Aunt Kate!
- Aunt Kate!

00:19:26.621 --> 00:19:28.428
You could've killed her by now.

00:19:28.788 --> 00:19:29.788
What a waste of time.

00:19:30.628 --> 00:19:31.708
Mind!

00:19:32.188 --> 00:19:33.289
- Come here!
- Leave me alone!

00:19:33.508 --> 00:19:34.428
Let go of me!

00:19:34.468 --> 00:19:35.228
Let go!

00:19:37.108 --> 00:19:39.228
Hand over the Shiva lingam
and the Yoni stone,

00:19:39.648 --> 00:19:41.148
or she dies.

00:20:27.228 --> 00:20:28.148
Aunt Kate...

00:20:28.948 --> 00:20:30.988
They were trying to draw Khunkhao out.

00:20:32.628 --> 00:20:34.148
Pun, are you okay now?

00:20:36.108 --> 00:20:36.900
I am.

00:20:37.228 --> 00:20:38.708
Take Aunt Kate to the hospital.

00:20:38.748 --> 00:20:40.508
Kor and I will go rescue Mind.

00:20:41.548 --> 00:20:42.326
Got it.

00:20:42.788 --> 00:20:43.588
Come on.

00:20:43.908 --> 00:20:44.788
Take it easy.

00:20:49.628 --> 00:20:50.601
Aunt Kate...

00:20:56.708 --> 00:20:58.508
Just tell us what you want.

00:20:58.868 --> 00:21:01.508
It's pathetic
seeing you all protecting each other.

00:21:03.508 --> 00:21:05.108
Especially you, Apo.

00:21:06.068 --> 00:21:09.348
The friend you cherished most,
Asuni, betrayed you.

00:21:14.108 --> 00:21:16.628
No matter how hard you try to lie to us,

00:21:16.868 --> 00:21:18.028
I won't buy it.

00:21:19.508 --> 00:21:21.668
Guess you'll have to see for yourselves.

00:21:29.508 --> 00:21:35.548
(Casting a spell)

00:21:36.788 --> 00:21:41.268
(Casting a spell)

00:21:42.408 --> 00:21:46.983
(Casting a spell)

00:22:25.588 --> 00:22:27.028
Tomorrow's ceremony

00:22:27.068 --> 00:22:29.588
concerns the bond between our two clans.

00:22:32.308 --> 00:22:34.188
It is our duty, yours and mine.

00:22:34.708 --> 00:22:35.988
And yet this ring...

00:22:39.188 --> 00:22:43.068
I bestow upon you
with a heart that is pure and sincere.

00:22:49.608 --> 00:22:50.508
Apo...

00:22:51.428 --> 00:22:52.748
I...

00:23:04.248 --> 00:23:06.228
Together, we shall stand

00:23:06.268 --> 00:23:08.388
and keep Tambralinga at peace for eternity.

00:23:25.548 --> 00:23:26.508
Apo.

00:23:31.068 --> 00:23:33.228
How fared your inspection of the provinces?

00:23:33.708 --> 00:23:34.948
All went well.

00:23:35.328 --> 00:23:38.068
Tomorrow marks an important day
for me and Suriya.

00:23:48.528 --> 00:23:49.708
Why has it been brought forward?

00:23:50.208 --> 00:23:51.788
You said it would be months hence.

00:23:52.388 --> 00:23:54.588
Our clans decreed it,

00:23:55.068 --> 00:23:57.108
so it would align
with the Maha Shivaratri festival.

00:23:59.268 --> 00:24:01.090
I sent word to you,

00:24:02.508 --> 00:24:04.508
but it appears
you were already returning.

00:24:07.108 --> 00:24:09.148
Fortunately, you have returned in time.

00:24:14.188 --> 00:24:15.348
There you are.

00:24:17.728 --> 00:24:19.308
Brahmin Kalakal has revolted

00:24:19.348 --> 00:24:21.228
and sent his forces to seize you.

00:26:14.348 --> 00:26:17.200
Should Kalakal continue
wielding the Heart of the Vedas incantation,

00:26:18.068 --> 00:26:20.228
the entire land shall fall under his power.

00:26:21.281 --> 00:26:23.308
He's trying to cast the Vedic mantra

00:26:23.588 --> 00:26:26.908
to strike down every life in Tambralinga
that opposes him,

00:26:27.508 --> 00:26:30.068
coercing us into summoning
the Heart of the Vedas,

00:26:30.108 --> 00:26:31.708
a power he cannot invoke on his own.

00:26:32.428 --> 00:26:33.988
We shall let him have his way

00:26:36.188 --> 00:26:37.428
before we bind him

00:26:37.908 --> 00:26:39.291
and summon the Heart of the Vedas.

00:26:39.868 --> 00:26:42.828
The Heart of the Vedas
is the very pillar of Tambralinga.

00:26:43.208 --> 00:26:44.908
Should we act thus...

00:26:45.388 --> 00:26:48.788
Tambralinga will be buried
and lost along with him.

00:26:50.868 --> 00:26:52.748
I shall not allow one so wicked

00:26:52.788 --> 00:26:56.148
to wield Tambralinga's forces
to massacre the people of our land.

00:27:06.868 --> 00:27:08.605
Surrender yourselves to me,

00:27:09.108 --> 00:27:10.500
and you shall be spared.

00:28:03.108 --> 00:28:04.348
Kalakal!

00:28:05.228 --> 00:28:06.668
You betrayed the city

00:28:06.908 --> 00:28:09.548
and broke the oath you made
to protect Tambralinga.

00:28:20.828 --> 00:28:22.108
Do you know what this is?

00:28:25.388 --> 00:28:26.468
Datula,

00:28:27.708 --> 00:28:28.828
a deadly flower.

00:28:42.808 --> 00:28:43.708
Earth...

00:28:44.588 --> 00:28:45.468
Yes, Professor?

00:28:47.428 --> 00:28:48.548
Keep an eye on them.

00:28:49.988 --> 00:28:50.788
Understood.

00:28:56.548 --> 00:28:57.362
Siwat,

00:28:57.828 --> 00:28:58.668
hang in there.

00:29:21.668 --> 00:29:22.508
Earth,

00:29:23.168 --> 00:29:24.748
how could you do this to your friends?

00:29:27.588 --> 00:29:28.788
I'm sorry.

00:29:36.468 --> 00:29:37.308
Dean?

00:29:38.828 --> 00:29:39.868
Thanks, Dean.

00:29:39.908 --> 00:29:40.744
No worries.

00:29:42.908 --> 00:29:43.745
Thara,

00:29:43.988 --> 00:29:45.788
you should go check on Mrs. Kate
at the hospital.

00:29:51.388 --> 00:29:52.268
Mom?

00:30:06.028 --> 00:30:07.028
Datula...

00:30:07.428 --> 00:30:10.428
It's a deadly flower that feeds on blood
and gnaws at the human heart.

00:30:10.468 --> 00:30:11.428
If it's not removed,

00:30:11.468 --> 00:30:12.988
it'll consume Siwat from within
and kill him.

00:30:15.496 --> 00:30:19.736
♫No matter how long it takes♫

00:30:19.776 --> 00:30:22.496
♫I'll still choose to love you♫

00:30:33.376 --> 00:30:34.376
What's wrong?

00:30:36.176 --> 00:30:37.103
I...

00:30:38.136 --> 00:30:39.229
My whole body aches.

00:30:41.256 --> 00:30:42.256
Where exactly?

00:30:43.436 --> 00:30:46.376
Right now, it's mostly my back.

00:30:47.536 --> 00:30:48.536
Let me see.

00:30:53.696 --> 00:30:54.696
Sh*t...

00:30:58.376 --> 00:30:59.576
Do something!

00:31:00.736 --> 00:31:02.216
If I knew what to do,
I'd have done it by now.

00:31:05.696 --> 00:31:06.776
What the hell is this?

00:31:07.316 --> 00:31:08.336
Datula.

00:31:11.976 --> 00:31:13.196
Datula...

00:31:13.321 --> 00:31:16.571
It's a deadly flower that feeds on blood
and gnaws at the human heart.

00:31:18.636 --> 00:31:19.576
If it's not removed,

00:31:20.136 --> 00:31:21.616
it'll consume Siwat from within
and kill him.

00:31:24.536 --> 00:31:26.256
You knew how much harm he'd cause,

00:31:26.496 --> 00:31:28.194
so why the hell did you still help him?

00:31:28.596 --> 00:31:29.456
- Huh?!
- Hey!

00:31:30.256 --> 00:31:31.136
I'm sorry!

00:31:31.736 --> 00:31:32.736
If I'd refused,

00:31:33.476 --> 00:31:34.656
he would've killed me.

00:31:42.716 --> 00:31:44.176
So do you know how to remove it?

00:31:46.136 --> 00:31:48.456
You need to take Siwat to the ruins

00:31:48.656 --> 00:31:50.717
where Uncle Singkhon
once led Professor Thakoon,

00:31:51.776 --> 00:31:53.096
to find the artifact

00:31:53.376 --> 00:31:55.936
that can remove
the datula from Siwat's body.

00:31:56.896 --> 00:31:57.896
What is it?

00:32:00.496 --> 00:32:01.776
The Heart of the Vedas.

00:32:20.536 --> 00:32:21.776
Get me the wheelchair.

00:32:21.816 --> 00:32:22.536
Sure.

00:32:25.616 --> 00:32:26.416
Aunt Kate?

00:32:27.896 --> 00:32:28.776
Dean,

00:32:28.816 --> 00:32:29.696
look after Siwat for me.

00:32:59.856 --> 00:33:00.976
How are you feeling, Aunt Kate?

00:33:02.116 --> 00:33:03.496
She's much better now,

00:33:03.696 --> 00:33:05.136
so the doctor let her recover at home.

00:33:06.936 --> 00:33:08.456
The bullet only grazed her muscle.

00:33:08.976 --> 00:33:10.656
It didn't reach any internal organs.

00:33:13.996 --> 00:33:15.216
I'm sorry

00:33:15.856 --> 00:33:16.936
I wasn't there with you.

00:33:17.516 --> 00:33:18.816
I'm fine. Don't worry.

00:33:19.696 --> 00:33:21.216
But Aisoon has taken Mind.

00:33:21.576 --> 00:33:23.096
We need to get her out immediately.

00:33:24.576 --> 00:33:26.034
You should stay here with your mom.

00:33:26.276 --> 00:33:27.336
I'll go get Mind back.

00:33:27.976 --> 00:33:29.556
I don't think you can do this alone.

00:33:30.516 --> 00:33:31.656
I'm safe now.

00:33:32.436 --> 00:33:34.856
You two should focus on your duty,

00:33:35.696 --> 00:33:37.696
protecting our family
and Khao Luang forest.

00:33:38.216 --> 00:33:38.896
Got it.

00:33:39.096 --> 00:33:39.776
Okay.

00:33:41.056 --> 00:33:42.356
Take care of each other, okay?

00:33:43.696 --> 00:33:44.536
We will.

00:35:07.936 --> 00:35:09.136
You pathetic cowards!

00:35:09.776 --> 00:35:11.456
Having me won't save your life.

00:35:12.316 --> 00:35:13.616
Once Khun gets here,

00:35:13.656 --> 00:35:14.656
you're all dead.

00:35:16.576 --> 00:35:18.159
What's all the fuss about?

00:35:21.176 --> 00:35:22.936
Yeah, that's much better.

00:35:26.096 --> 00:35:27.216
- Hey.
- What?

00:35:27.456 --> 00:35:28.666
Why bother capturing her?

00:35:28.896 --> 00:35:29.736
Obviously,

00:35:30.136 --> 00:35:32.896
we need a hostage to cover our backs.

00:35:33.436 --> 00:35:36.096
Those guys will catch up to us soon, anyway.

00:35:37.376 --> 00:35:38.736
You'd better keep her under control.

00:35:40.056 --> 00:35:43.796
If she starts kicking up a fuss,

00:35:44.056 --> 00:35:45.536
I'll just end her.

00:35:45.896 --> 00:35:47.056
Easy.

00:35:50.896 --> 00:35:51.816
Ohm,

00:35:52.256 --> 00:35:53.256
a cup of coffee.

00:35:53.416 --> 00:35:54.256
Right away.

00:36:41.216 --> 00:36:44.296
Just how extraordinary
is the Heart of the Vedas?

00:36:48.016 --> 00:36:50.776
Any wish in the three realms,
if one asks for it,

00:36:51.716 --> 00:36:53.596
the Heart of the Vedas will grant it.

00:36:56.216 --> 00:36:58.816
An artifact of absolute power,

00:36:59.216 --> 00:37:02.359
capable of commanding anything.

00:37:06.016 --> 00:37:08.576
Then can it control that madman?

00:37:28.016 --> 00:37:31.177
Why are you so desperate
to go after such a dangerous place?

00:37:31.217 --> 00:37:32.456
I need to see it with my own eyes.

00:37:32.496 --> 00:37:34.096
You might die before you do.

00:37:34.136 --> 00:37:36.896
Everything must return to the beginning.

00:37:36.936 --> 00:37:37.905
The beginning?

00:37:37.924 --> 00:37:42.164
♫No matter how long it takes♫

00:37:42.204 --> 00:37:44.924
♫I'll still choose to love you♫

00:38:06.524 --> 00:38:09.284
You have three days to reach the ruins.

00:38:10.764 --> 00:38:12.564
It's the only chance to save Siwat.

00:38:12.844 --> 00:38:14.004
We need to make it in time.

00:38:15.924 --> 00:38:16.844
Pun,

00:38:17.644 --> 00:38:18.884
this time,

00:38:19.164 --> 00:38:21.324
even we don't know
if we'll make it back alive.

00:38:21.564 --> 00:38:22.244
What?

00:38:22.484 --> 00:38:24.644
We don't want you
to risk your life for nothing.

00:38:25.544 --> 00:38:26.804
Hear me out.

00:38:27.164 --> 00:38:29.644
If I get to be there with you guys,
it's worth it.

00:38:30.044 --> 00:38:31.584
I'm just an orphan

00:38:31.844 --> 00:38:34.571
who's made it this far
because of you guys and Aunt Kate.

00:38:35.324 --> 00:38:38.004
Let me do something for you,
just for once.

00:38:38.424 --> 00:38:41.044
We helped you because you're our friend.

00:38:41.324 --> 00:38:43.244
We never expected anything in return.

00:38:44.604 --> 00:38:45.844
But I do.

00:38:46.624 --> 00:38:48.324
I do hope you won't stop me.

00:38:50.244 --> 00:38:52.044
I'm doing this to support my friends.

00:38:53.484 --> 00:38:54.284
Alright.

00:39:18.904 --> 00:39:21.364
I'm mad at you for helping Thakoon.

00:39:22.044 --> 00:39:24.244
You brought those people in
to ruin the forest

00:39:24.524 --> 00:39:26.604
and put my family in danger.

00:39:29.324 --> 00:39:30.404
But I understand you.

00:39:30.984 --> 00:39:33.084
He threatened and forced you.

00:39:33.684 --> 00:39:35.244
Now that you're free, stay away from him.

00:39:37.324 --> 00:39:38.724
You can go now.

00:39:39.644 --> 00:39:41.938
I've spent years researching
Tambralinga with Professor Thakoon.

00:39:42.004 --> 00:39:43.684
I can really be useful to you.

00:39:43.844 --> 00:39:47.124
Why are you so desperate
to go after such a dangerous place?

00:39:47.324 --> 00:39:48.724
I need to see it with my own eyes.

00:39:49.584 --> 00:39:51.404
You might die before you do.

00:39:51.724 --> 00:39:52.724
I'm not scared.

00:39:54.084 --> 00:39:55.084
Let me come with you.

00:39:56.124 --> 00:39:57.124
Please.

00:39:59.704 --> 00:40:00.704
If you can't keep up,

00:40:01.204 --> 00:40:02.204
we won't wait.

00:40:12.004 --> 00:40:13.204
It's still not too late

00:40:13.364 --> 00:40:14.644
to change your mind.

00:41:07.064 --> 00:41:07.764
Let's go.

00:41:08.704 --> 00:41:09.844
And be careful.

00:41:37.284 --> 00:41:39.684
How can you be so sure they're after us?

00:41:42.284 --> 00:41:43.044
What?

00:41:46.404 --> 00:41:47.364
This tracker...

00:41:47.574 --> 00:41:48.964
It was your son, wasn't it?

00:41:49.324 --> 00:41:50.004
What?

00:41:50.284 --> 00:41:51.484
Open your f*cking eyes.

00:41:55.204 --> 00:41:56.324
Son of a b*tch.

00:41:58.004 --> 00:41:59.204
It's a good thing, though.

00:41:59.957 --> 00:42:01.204
I want them to find us.

00:43:15.724 --> 00:43:17.644
They're about 200 meters away.

00:43:21.844 --> 00:43:22.964
You guys should wait here.

00:43:23.324 --> 00:43:24.724
Thara and I will go rescue Mind.

00:43:34.444 --> 00:43:35.844
Keep an eye on him.

00:43:36.524 --> 00:43:37.244
Got it.

00:44:01.284 --> 00:44:01.884
Hey,

00:44:02.204 --> 00:44:03.204
what are you trying to do?

00:44:11.964 --> 00:44:12.884
I'm sorry...

00:44:15.064 --> 00:44:17.004
for dragging you into all this mess.

00:44:19.324 --> 00:44:20.379
It's not your fault.

00:44:21.844 --> 00:44:24.164
It must be the fate we're meant to face.

00:44:32.484 --> 00:44:33.173
Wait.

00:44:34.604 --> 00:44:37.124
You two go around and get Mind over there.

00:44:38.684 --> 00:44:40.284
Thara and I will handle things here.

00:44:55.204 --> 00:44:56.204
Take Mind now.

00:44:56.564 --> 00:44:57.284
Shoot them!

00:44:59.604 --> 00:45:00.404
Shoot them now!

00:45:01.844 --> 00:45:02.604
Do it.

00:45:02.764 --> 00:45:03.484
You b*stard!

00:45:04.764 --> 00:45:05.623
Give it to me!

00:45:05.778 --> 00:45:06.513
Come on.

00:45:09.784 --> 00:45:10.924
Wait, where's Thakoon?

00:45:11.324 --> 00:45:12.324
He's gone!

00:45:13.004 --> 00:45:13.804
Go find him.

00:45:14.604 --> 00:45:15.524
He has the necklaces.

00:45:17.564 --> 00:45:18.204
Go.

00:46:14.484 --> 00:46:16.964
They already have
the Yoni stone and the Shiva lingam.

00:46:17.584 --> 00:46:19.724
Why would they want me to go to the ruins?

00:46:35.204 --> 00:46:36.844
Professor Thakoon once told me that

00:46:37.664 --> 00:46:41.204
everything must return to the beginning.

00:46:44.044 --> 00:46:45.204
The beginning?

00:47:08.244 --> 00:47:09.764
Now I can see the whole past.

00:47:09.964 --> 00:47:11.865
We must find the city gate immediately,

00:47:12.044 --> 00:47:14.244
before he unites the atman with its mortal form.

00:47:24.284 --> 00:47:24.884
No, Maria!

00:47:24.924 --> 00:47:25.524
Stop!

00:47:26.844 --> 00:47:27.364
Dad!

00:47:27.404 --> 00:47:27.947
No!

00:47:28.684 --> 00:47:29.284
Dad!

00:47:29.524 --> 00:47:31.324
We're entering the fog forest,

00:47:31.524 --> 00:47:32.629
the final territory.

00:47:32.884 --> 00:47:34.204
But the fog is toxic.

00:47:36.324 --> 00:47:37.164
Siwat!

00:47:37.284 --> 00:47:41.724
♫No matter how long it takes♫

00:47:41.764 --> 00:47:45.204
♫I'll still choose to love you♫

00:47:45.244 --> 00:47:52.444
♫This heart's forever loyal, no difference♫

00:47:53.244 --> 00:47:56.684
♫It keeps beating for you forevermore♫

00:47:56.724 --> 00:48:00.284
♫Never want to change, alright♫

00:48:00.324 --> 00:48:05.164
♫There's only you there inside my heart♫

00:48:05.204 --> 00:48:09.844
♫My love for you never evanesces♫
