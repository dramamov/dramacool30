WEBVTT

00:01:10.722 --> 00:01:13.840
(Returning Pearl)

00:01:15.112 --> 00:01:16.647
Xiao Yan Zi is a vulgar and cunning girl.

00:01:16.952 --> 00:01:19.567
But just using Lin Er alone might not be enough.

00:01:19.851 --> 00:01:21.027
Your Majesty, are you suggesting...

00:01:21.711 --> 00:01:25.287
Yuan is dashing and promising.

00:01:25.792 --> 00:01:28.445
Lord Jing is of the Ula Nara bloodline.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.440
He's far too good for the likes of Xiao Yan Zi.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.936
Once Xiao Yan Zi becomes your daughter-in-law,

00:01:33.312 --> 00:01:36.539
you can mold her and control her

00:01:36.946 --> 00:01:38.287
however you wish.

00:01:39.551 --> 00:01:41.688
If that child could become a son-in-law of the royal family,

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.976
I will have done my duty by my sister.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.598
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:01:46.271 --> 00:01:47.968
If their plan succeeds,

00:01:48.471 --> 00:01:50.048
things will be even more of a mess!

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.633
No way.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.201
Lord Jing

00:01:53.512 --> 00:01:56.480
is my life-saving insurance, okay?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.296
I can't let him break up Xiao Yan Zi and Fifth Prince!

00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:20.687
They're about to have physical contact! No!

00:02:45.392 --> 00:02:47.448
Princess Huan Zhu!

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.913
Here.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.416
It's okay now.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.913
What does "okay" mean?

00:03:09.952 --> 00:03:12.704
It means, "oh, it's good."

00:03:14.551 --> 00:03:15.664
It's a compliment.

00:03:15.904 --> 00:03:17.017
Now, try it.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.585
- So? - It's so good!

00:03:23.431 --> 00:03:25.585
It's okay! Very okay!

00:03:27.831 --> 00:03:30.298
Oh, it's good.

00:03:37.472 --> 00:03:40.602
I've never tasted anything this good, not in the palace or out there.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.080
Does it have a name?

00:03:43.431 --> 00:03:44.807
I'm sorry, Xiao Yan Zi.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.895
I've wasted too many words talking to you.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.488
I've got an idea.

00:03:53.271 --> 00:03:55.864
It's called Lin's Bubble Milk Tea!

00:03:57.512 --> 00:03:58.951
Lin's Bubble Milk Tea.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.682
Anyway, the important thing is, I'm finally free of that Nanny Rong!

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.893
Your Highness, Nanny Rong may be strict,

00:04:06.974 --> 00:04:08.359
but she's a senior in the palace.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.720
You would do well to learn from her.

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:11.415
I can learn!

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.920
But can't I learn from someone else?

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.535
Nanny Rong is terrifying!

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.336
How about this? I'll learn from Consort Ling.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.495
She's beautiful and kind. I like her.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.002
What about Fifth Prince?

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.880
How about you learn from His Highness?

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.394
I mean, you could have Fifth Prince teach you. How about it?

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.365
Fifth Prince?

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.640
You mean the one who shot me with an arrow?

00:04:34.921 --> 00:04:36.776
I'm being polite by not cracking his head open!

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.720
That was just an unfortunate misunderstanding.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.280
Fifth Prince is a great man.

00:04:40.401 --> 00:04:42.240
His Highness is His Majesty's favourite son.

00:04:42.358 --> 00:04:43.820
His Majesty is very wise.

00:04:43.901 --> 00:04:45.953
So if he favors him, how could he possibly be bad?

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.506
Isn't that right?

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.536
Why are you looking at Lord Jing

00:04:50.921 --> 00:04:52.896
when you're talking to me?

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.793
I twisted my neck when I fell earlier. It's stuck.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.053
- I'll adjust it for you. - No need!

00:05:03.801 --> 00:05:04.914
Thank you.

00:05:08.127 --> 00:05:09.240
Your Highness,

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.115
Her Majesty has asked me to find you

00:05:11.195 --> 00:05:13.018
some beginner-level books to start with.

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.453
As a newcomer to the palace, there is much to learn.

00:05:15.621 --> 00:05:16.734
A solid foundation is essential.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.962
How thoughtful of you, Lord Jing.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.080
I can't read.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.081
I believe that with diligence and a desire to learn,

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.376
you will make progress in due time.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.616
Well, Lord Jing can certainly help with that.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.600
His nickname in the palace is

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:34.435
the "Living King of Hell,"

00:05:35.361 --> 00:05:36.480
The Living King of Hell?

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.296
When I was in the Laundry Bureau,

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.416
I saw him execute an old nanny right on the spot!

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.417
He executed her on the spot!

00:05:48.041 --> 00:05:49.513
There was a family in the northern suburbs.

00:05:49.673 --> 00:05:51.329
The daughter never wanted to be a palace maid,

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.120
but her father, blinded by money,

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.580
used Nanny Song's connections

00:05:54.661 --> 00:05:56.397
to force her into service.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.137
For three years, the girl's monthly stipend was taken by Nanny Song.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.600
In the end, the girl could bear it no longer

00:06:04.068 --> 00:06:05.181
and threw herself down a well.

00:06:06.207 --> 00:06:07.226
Your Highness,

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:10.076
do you think Nanny Song's death was unjust?

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.760
Not all all! She deserved it!

00:06:14.015 --> 00:06:15.550
The palace may appear peaceful on the surface,

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.773
but in reality, there is danger everywhere.

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.873
You are new here, Your Highness.

00:06:21.241 --> 00:06:22.553
You must be cautious

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.680
and not let yourself be deceived by those with ill intentions.

00:06:28.807 --> 00:06:33.200
Being able to make a friend like you in the palace is a blessing.

00:06:33.514 --> 00:06:34.627
Don't worry, Lord Jing.

00:06:34.859 --> 00:06:37.497
I'll listen to you and study hard.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.082
Good.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.656
Those sparkling, admiring eyes are supposed to be for Fifth Prince!

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.936
How has the plot gotten so derailed?

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.320
Looks like the first step to fixing this story

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.496
is to make Xiao Yan Zi dislike Jing Yuan.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.217
You look so harmless,

00:06:54.601 --> 00:06:55.937
but you're quite manipulative, huh?

00:07:00.601 --> 00:07:04.056
Yuan, Princess Huan Zhu has only just entered the palace.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.536
You must look after her well.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.513
What is he writing?

00:07:25.241 --> 00:07:26.496
A love letter?

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.496
For who?

00:07:31.681 --> 00:07:33.536
Could it be for Xiao Yan Zi?

00:07:58.999 --> 00:08:00.775
You're the first person brave enough

00:08:01.721 --> 00:08:02.937
to spy outside my window.

00:08:09.173 --> 00:08:10.286
Go back.

00:08:11.087 --> 00:08:12.200
And don't do it again.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:17.800
Why did you reach out your hand?

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.697
I need to talk to you.

00:08:29.127 --> 00:08:30.240
Come in.

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:33.833
You...

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.520
I'm going to get something on you

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.137
and expose your true colors.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.713
It's improper for a man and a woman to be alone in a room at this hour.

00:08:49.481 --> 00:08:50.966
So whatever you have to say, say it quickly.

00:08:52.601 --> 00:08:53.714
What's the matter?

00:08:54.321 --> 00:08:55.434
Are you scared?

00:08:56.841 --> 00:08:59.594
I'm not going to bite you.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:05.522
Bedside reading...

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:08.456
Don't tell me you're...

00:09:09.107 --> 00:09:10.723
I'm going to expose you!

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.577
I'm here to borrow a book.

00:09:14.887 --> 00:09:16.000
That one.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:21.153
Why would a palace maid be studying military strategy?

00:09:22.033 --> 00:09:23.146
Military strategy?

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:25.806
(The Art of War)

00:09:26.201 --> 00:09:27.697
I should've known.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.257
When I was little,

00:09:32.601 --> 00:09:34.817
The Art of War

00:09:36.321 --> 00:09:38.016
was my father's favorite book.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.695
But before he could finish teaching me,

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.336
he passed away.

00:09:50.147 --> 00:09:51.363
My father, too.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.377
If you want this book,

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:00.832
I'll lend it to you.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.073
What did you say?

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.033
I said

00:10:08.201 --> 00:10:09.776
don't ask questions you shouldn't.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.353
These practice sheets

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.256
are clearly meant for a beginner.

00:10:25.841 --> 00:10:27.386
These are for Princess Huan Zhu, aren't they?

00:10:31.201 --> 00:10:32.314
That's none of your concern.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.840
Everyone in the palace knows

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.376
you and I are a couple.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.060
If you're seen fawning over Her Highness,

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:46.560
you'll be known as a two-timing scoundrel.

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:47.753
You...

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:49.873
So...

00:10:50.321 --> 00:10:52.856
I'll deliver these for you.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.497
That way, your precious reputation remains intact.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:03.553
Bye!

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:05.593
Wait.

00:11:07.714 --> 00:11:08.827
Use the door.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.096
I'll keep it quiet.

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.256
Outrageous! This is utterly disgraceful!

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:35.880
Sir, why are you so angry?

00:11:35.961 --> 00:11:38.360
Look, the turtle's drawn really well!

00:11:38.441 --> 00:11:39.846
- Your Highness! - Xiao Yan Zi.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.760
You can't scribble on your practice sheet.

00:11:41.841 --> 00:11:44.337
- Apologize to Mister Ji at once. - I didn't draw this.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:47.496
I got this from Lord Jing. I didn't even open it.

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.736
I have to get the plot back on track.

00:11:56.081 --> 00:11:58.057
I'm sorry for setting you up,

00:11:58.601 --> 00:11:59.896
Xiao Yan Zi.

00:12:00.201 --> 00:12:02.136
I'm sure Fifth Prince will help you out.

00:12:04.353 --> 00:12:05.882
Such mischief!

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.713
You're to copy the Three Character Classic a hundred times.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.526
A hundred times?

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:18.720
- But I... - Mister Ji, Xiao Yan Zi's injury hasn't fully healed.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.853
- Look at Fifth Prince. - I'll take the punishment for her.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.736
See how good Fifth Prince is to you?

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:26.946
Not like Jing Yuan, who got you scolded and punished.

00:12:28.627 --> 00:12:31.696
Whoever framed Her Highness knows perfectly well who they are.

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:33.055
Sharp ears.

00:12:35.753 --> 00:12:36.866
Sir.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:42.146
The princes and princesses exclusively use the high-quality tribute ink

00:12:42.486 --> 00:12:44.937
from the Imperial Household, ideal for calligraphy and painting.

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:46.719
Burdened with official duties,

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.896
I use the more common pine soot ink for writing.

00:12:53.319 --> 00:12:54.935
However, the person who drew this turtle

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:58.438
used the most ordinary Hui ink found in the palace.

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:02.055
So someone pretended to be Jing Yuan

00:13:02.501 --> 00:13:04.202
just to frame Xiao Yan Zi.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.846
Yes. Who would do such a thing?

00:13:07.287 --> 00:13:09.183
And with what motive?

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:16.493
It was me!

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.856
Sir, I drew the turtle.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.233
I'll accept the punishment!

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:25.873
Hang on...
