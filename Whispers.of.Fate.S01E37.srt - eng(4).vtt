[Whispers of Fate]

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.950
[Episode 37]

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.229
You can continue being a princess,

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.740
and I'll become the Sword Master.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.270
If we two women join forces,

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.430
both the imperial court

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.350
and jianghu

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.039
will be under our control.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.380
Wouldn't that be

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.490
a wonderful world?

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.259
I won't hurt you,

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.670
and you won't hurt me either.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.259
We need each other

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.750
and we rely on each other.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:57.509
We...

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.950
can be a pair of phoenixes

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.820
looking down upon the world.

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.860
We...

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.630
can be an invincible duo.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.730
All you need to do is...

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.630
All I need to do is give you
the votes I receive,

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.790
so you can defeat Tang Lici.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.640
I'll leave Your Highness to it.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.470
I believe Your Highness

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.310
will make the decision

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.170
that best serves your interests.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.280
Your Highness,

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.470
Mr. Tang invites you for a meeting.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.540
These are Morning Dew Flowers.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:26.940
They blossom at midnight

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.280
and wither before dawn.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.960
They only bloom

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.160
one night a year.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.140
Since their blossoms don't last long,

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.670
few people know about them.

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:37.579
They're most beautiful when in bud.

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.530
They already look stunning now.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:41.310
After they bloom,

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.460
won't there be a more spectacular view?

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.070
After they bloom,

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.090
only the rotten centers will remain.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.910
People admire their beautiful appearances

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:52.770
simply because

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.440
they've never seen the inside of them.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.860
So much ugliness exists in the world.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.070
There's no such thing as absolute beauty.

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:02.630
Growing wildly is better

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:04.270
than being ordinary.

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.310
Even just a brief moment of glory

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.860
is enough.

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.590
Look how pretty it is now.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:38.560
You got injured.

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.220
The rotten centers

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:42.909
breed venomous insects.

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:45.750
When the toxins get to
one's heart and meridians,

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.280
this person can't be cured.

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.800
Therefore,

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.510
these flowers had better

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:51.710
be admired from afar,

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:53.330
and not be approached.

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.620
Those who heedlessly pluck them

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.330
will inevitably get hurt.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.310
It turns out this little speech

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.160
is why you asked me to come.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.310
You also disapprove of me
running for the position of Sword Master?

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:12.340
Yes.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.520
I'm in over my head.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.140
But so what?

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:20.960
I'm just living for myself.

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:22.700
Even if I'll be covered in wounds,

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:23.220
or...

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.310
or I'll have to hurt others,

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.510
I'll still rather not upset myself

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.710
and spend the rest of my life in regrets.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.780
Ms. Zhong.

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:55.990
We need more practice.

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.700
Indeed.

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:03.460
I hate this.

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.220
So much noise in the early morning.

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:05.870
Why did I never notice

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.600
how noisy Mount Cloud could be?

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:09.380
Chi!

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:10.990
We heard you had come back,

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:12.190
so we came for a visit.

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:14.870
Coming. I'll open the door.

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.450
Even the door is sealed up?

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:20.170
Is that necessary?

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:22.300
Forget it.

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:23.550
I'm having a terrible headache.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.010
I don't want to see anyone.

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.750
Chi Yun,

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:27.950
are you sick?

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.370
Shall I get you a royal physician?

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:32.550
Scram!

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:34.020
You're sick!

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:35.550
I'm not!

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:36.580
Go away!

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:46.550
What's wrong with you?

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:49.430
Maybe Chi is in a bad mood.

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.300
Let's come back another day.

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:54.940
You know what?

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:56.790
Mr. Chi isn't recuperating.

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.420
In fact, he's been poisoned.

00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:59.220
Really?

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:01.310
What kind of potent poison is it?

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:02.580
If it were an ordinary poison,

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:03.780
he would've been cured.

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:04.630
I heard he was exposed

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:06.580
to a new poison
generated by the Blood Ghost Pills.

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:07.380
The poisoned ones tend to

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:08.630
become irritable and aggressive.

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:10.670
When provoked,
they may even attack others.

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:12.220
Those who are unfortunately injured

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:13.430
by them will be infected

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:14.460
even without taking the Evil Pills.

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:15.110
Then why did Mr. Tang

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:16.460
bring him back to the Sword Alliance?

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:17.790
Aren't we in danger now?

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:35.140
Mr. Chi's condition

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:36.270
is quite worrisome.

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.020
Miss Xifang,

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:39.430
did you anticipate

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:40.760
the current situation?

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:46.090
By saying this, Master Jiang,

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:48.140
are you asking me to guide you

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:49.580
through perplexity,

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:51.070
or...

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:52.820
are you going to offer me advice,

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:54.880
since you've figured out something?

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:58.550
Don't get me wrong, Miss Xifang.

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:00.460
Since you joined the Sword Alliance,

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.630
you've prioritized
eradicating Fengliu Shop

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:04.820
and protecting the innocent all the time.

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:05.580
I'm a witness

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:08.070
to all the efforts you've made.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:09.460
Tang Lici's kindness

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:10.860
is certainly admirable.

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:12.480
But even Shui Duopo has said

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:14.780
that it'll take a long time
to develop an antidote.

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:17.380
The poisoned people
are honestly beyond help.

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:18.990
Now, a new poison has emerged.

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:21.020
I'm afraid
its spread will get out of control.

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:22.260
At the moment, the Sword Alliance

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:23.700
needs a decisive and composed leader

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:25.260
such as yourself, Miss Xifang.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.340
Tang Lici and the fuss he's making
must be stopped soon,

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:28.510
or the entire Sword Alliance

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:29.950
and even the whole jianghu

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:31.480
may be plunged into danger.

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:32.690
Considering that,

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:33.750
the Investigation Hall

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:36.100
and the Nine Heavenly Sword Weapons
I'm in charge of

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:37.150
will be at your service

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:38.610
in the upcoming election,

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:40.909
Miss Xifang.

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:46.270
How reasonable and just of you,
Master Jiang.

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:47.580
However,

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:49.380
Mr. Chi is a friend of Mr. Tang's.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.360
If we interfere with this matter,

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:53.580
Mr. Tang will definitely
fight tooth and nail against us.

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:55.840
This won't do good to the Sword Alliance.

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:58.980
Miss Xifang, you're saying...

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:01.310
Recently, it has come to my notice

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:03.550
that Mr. Tang is behaving suspiciously.

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:04.390
It seems

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:05.740
he's hiding something.

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:09.220
Miss Xifang, have you found

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:10.700
any specific clues?

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:15.270
Tang Lici a very cautious man.

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:17.870
It's not that easy to uncover

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.540
the secrets he's trying to keep.

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:30.750
With Master Shao looking after Liu Yan,

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:32.120
I can put my mind at ease.

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:34.870
But even with Liu Yan's help,

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:36.670
it'll still take some time

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:38.270
before the antidote is made.

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:40.840
Worse still, the toxins in Chi Yun

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:42.790
don't allow him to wait too long.

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:45.190
I must expedite the making process
for him.

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:47.510
Can you stop acting the hero?

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:49.590
How much more blood can you lose?

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:51.860
Your power and blood
have been depleted,

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:53.070
and your inner energy disrupted.

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:55.150
These days,
you must refrain from losing blood

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:56.100
and using the Rebirth Scroll again

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:56.900
to save lives.

00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:59.310
Those three pills have been used up.

00:09:59.310 --> 00:09:59.950
Your current condition

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:01.220
is far more dangerous than you imagine.

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.420
One reckless move could cost your life.

00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:08.950
Senior,

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:11.150
the Sword Alliance now needs

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:12.670
a Tang Lici in his prime.

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:14.220
And my companions

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:15.580
also need that.

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:21.070
Master Shao,

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:22.870
it all counts on you.

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:38.880
Fifteen grams too much.

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:07.430
Miss Shui,

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:09.700
in my spare time lately,

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:11.310
I've been researching
how to counter the effects

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:12.460
brought by the Blood Ghost Pills.

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:13.820
I've made some progress.

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:15.550
I would love to have your input.

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:17.460
Who's been researching?

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:18.030
Me.

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:34.700
Miss Shui, do you think this formula

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:35.300
will work?

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:39.510
What a genius you are in medicine,
Master Shao.

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:41.210
Like a hidden gem, aren't you?

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:42.390
I'm so flattered.

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:44.030
I just want to learn more.

00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:46.390
One is never too old to learn, right?

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:47.790
Drop the act.

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:49.700
Only someone with profound knowledge

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:50.700
of both medicine and poison

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:52.230
could create this formula.

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:53.960
Master Shao, level with me.

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:56.120
Where did you get this formula?

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:58.090
No wonder you can be my senior.

00:11:58.220 --> 00:11:59.910
I shouldn't have lied to a real expert.

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:01.240
You've seen me through.

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:07.680
The potent poison
within the Blood Ghost Pill

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:10.310
can hardly be eliminated
by neutral

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:11.440
and mild antidotes.

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:14.410
It has to be countered by another poison.

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:15.880
He's on the right track.

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:17.620
But it takes careful consideration
before deciding

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:18.910
the portions of toxic ingredients

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:20.860
and the way they're meshed together.

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:21.580
There will be more progress

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:23.040
if I get to meet and discuss

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:25.500
with the creator of this formula
in person.

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:28.030
It's better not to meet him.

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:30.460
I got it.

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:32.670
Next time,

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:33.950
bring this to him.

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:35.220
What is it?

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:36.740
The notes I took when I studied

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:37.740
the poison pills.

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:40.010
My findings may be helpful to him.

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:41.900
On behalf of the Sword Alliance,

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:44.210
I express my gratitude to you, Miss Shui.

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:56.550
Footprints?

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:01.670
Was someone

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:04.220
eavesdropping on us?

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.030
Welcome home, my best assassin.

00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:26.740
I'm afraid that after today,

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:28.340
you need to pick someone else

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:30.050
as your best assassin, Chief.

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:34.350
Do you plan to join the Sword Alliance?

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:35.740
Entering a righteous sect
after working as an assassin

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:37.200
can't be that easy, can it?

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:39.340
Even Xifang Tao was admitted

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:40.740
into the Sword Alliance.

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:42.170
Why can't I join it too?

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:44.640
The Sword Alliance took Xifang Tao in

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:45.360
because she had

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.030
Master Puzhu as her referee.

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:48.500
Then, she devised

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:49.860
clever plans herself.

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:51.460
By contrast, you only have

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:53.060
Tang Lici as your supporter.

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:55.030
Elections are about

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:56.870
winning the voters' hearts.

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:58.190
People in fear would only

00:13:58.190 --> 00:13:59.790
want to protect themselves.

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:01.310
Xifang Tao has seized upon

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:03.040
this very part of human nature.

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:04.460
She takes drastic measures

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:05.860
against the poisoned people.

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:07.310
Also, she's running for
the position of Sword Master

00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:09.370
on a promise to protect the innocent.

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:11.670
Therefore,
the more serious the poison crisis is,

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:12.950
the more people will follow

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:13.820
and support

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:14.860
Xifang Tao.

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:17.670
By contrast,

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:19.390
Tang Lici and the princess

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:21.050
have set off on bumpier roads.

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:23.270
The former needs to atone
for Liu Yan's sins,

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:26.070
while the latter bears
court-appointed responsibilities.

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:29.400
Neither of them can turn their backs
on the poisoned people.

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:31.310
But how many people in this world

00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:33.490
are willing to risk getting infected

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:35.190
to speak up for those

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:37.070
who deserve death?

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:38.950
Suppose you weren't

00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:40.810
the top assassin of Shisan Tower,

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:41.460
but just

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:44.100
an ordinary person
with no means of self-protection,

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:44.670
who...

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:46.680
will you choose?

00:14:58.580 --> 00:14:59.100
Lici,

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:00.750
there you are.

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:11.030
I've brought you

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:12.230
those precious herbs

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:14.720
you asked for last time.

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:32.860
Blood?

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:36.900
I didn't ask for this.

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:38.700
My blood contains

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:40.500
the power of the Rebirth Scroll

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:42.220
and resists all kinds of poison.

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:43.910
I used it on you previously
when I suppressed

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:44.910
the toxins in you.

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:53.670
When you're about
to be killed by the Evil Pills,

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:55.270
you'll know how useful it is.

00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:00.250
Show me your wrist!

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:09.310
If the Rebirth Scroll is the same

00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:10.100
as before,

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:12.060
why hasn't your wound

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:13.820
healed yet?

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:15.390
Did you

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:17.250
save lives with your blood again?

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:20.500
The wound will heal eventually.

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:22.680
The Rebirth Scroll

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:26.150
shouldn't be wasted
on such trivial matters.

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:28.610
Can you stop putting on a brave front?

00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:30.750
How much more blood can you lose?

00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:45.340
More than you can.

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:49.930
If you die before I do,

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:52.630
I'll quit working on the antidote.

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:53.860
Liu Yan,

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:55.670
I won't die.

00:16:57.390 --> 00:16:59.590
Before you finish making the antidote,

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:01.270
I won't let you die either.

00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:03.350
Always keep this in mind:

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:05.319
you must get the antidote done

00:17:05.609 --> 00:17:07.060
to make amends for your misdeeds

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:08.190
to those you harmed.

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:10.060
No.

00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:11.670
No!

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:13.190
No.

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:15.640
This time you must listen to me.

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:17.109
You must listen to me!

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:17.950
Liu Yan!

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:21.390
When will you cut off this madness?

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:22.780
You must listen to me.

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:23.829
You must!

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:27.500
The tea is ready.

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:30.730
I used the Longjing tea leaves
from behind the village.

00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:33.270
Mr. Tang, have a cup of it too.

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:39.830
It's very tasty.

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:41.410
The villagers all like it.

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:55.240
Let me refill your cup.

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:56.260
Don't bother.

00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:58.220
He has never liked

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:00.640
Longjing tea since he was little.

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:10.160
I see the Sword Alliance

00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:13.110
can't afford the tea you usually enjoy.

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:16.100
When did you learn
to settle for the less ideal?

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:25.190
Occasionally

00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:27.520
forcing myself to do what I'm reluctant to

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:29.350
actually feels nice.

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:41.310
Thanks for the tea, Miss.

00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:43.880
The future herb deliveries...

00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:45.020
will be made

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:47.020
by Master Shao as before.

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:05.030
Stop testing the concoctions on yourself.

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:08.630
The well-being of all mankind

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:09.690
now depends on you.

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:11.270
Make sure you try your best.

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:18.870
Stop using your blood

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:19.730
to save others!

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:34.670
You ignored my advice again.

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:36.070
You never took my advice!

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:39.190
You disregarded my advice every time.

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:41.640
You just wouldn't take my advice.

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:44.070
No wonder you two
could be fellows in a sect.

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:50.510
[Tingyun Pavilion]

00:19:57.980 --> 00:19:58.590
This...

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:00.590
should be enough to suppress

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:02.520
the toxins in Chi Yun for a few days.

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:20.390
Tang Lici.

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:22.430
Yique Yinyang?

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:24.190
This is...

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:25.640
Mount Baojing?

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:28.220
Why, to this day,

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:30.620
are you still so obstinate?

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:33.350
Have you not realized

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:36.110
that these vile and inferior beings

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:38.300
shouldn't exist at all?

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:39.630
What do you mean?

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:41.390
Are you feeling

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:43.300
you're completely useless now?

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:47.460
You thought you could save everyone

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:49.220
all by yourself.

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:51.830
Everything you've done

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:53.190
is nothing

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:54.910
but futile struggle.

00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:58.480
You've even worn yourself down
to this state.

00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:00.260
Nonsense!

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:02.330
We both come from the same place.

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.220
Soon, our homeland

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:07.500
will descend upon Shenzhou.

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:09.870
Tang Lici,

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:11.730
I can give you power.

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:13.990
We can become gods together.

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:16.910
You know where to find me.

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:20.060
Mr. Tang,

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:21.260
your meal

00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:22.460
is placed at the door.

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:23.870
Here's a reminder from Master Shao:

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:26.130
please eat regularly during seclusion.

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:34.210
When did I fall asleep?

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:37.950
The bronze tree has been destroyed.

00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:40.810
It's impossible
for Yique Yinyang to materialize.

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.230
Whatever plans Tianren Realm has,

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:45.030
they won't be fulfilled.

00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:58.150
Why hasn't Mr. Tang Lici

00:21:58.150 --> 00:21:59.670
arrived yet?

00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:02.040
It's taking so long.

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:03.670
Yeah.

00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:17.740
Why hasn't Mr. Tang

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:18.740
shown up yet?

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:19.670
Is something holding Mr. Tang back?

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:21.000
Among the 3 candidates,

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:23.410
he's the only one who hasn't arrived yet.

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:30.260
I can't believe

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:31.670
Mr. Tang actually lacks faith

00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:33.950
in his ability to be elected Sword Master.

00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:34.880
Or...

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:38.210
does he not care about the Sword Alliance
at all?

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:40.080
Master Shao,

00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:41.590
it's about time.

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:43.840
Shall we start counting the votes?

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:47.500
Begin it now.

00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:48.700
Yes.

00:22:58.190 --> 00:22:59.260
The rules of the Central Plains

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:01.500
Sword Alliance for the election
of Sword Master are as follows.

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:02.630
Each regular disciple

00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:03.460
has one vote.

00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:04.980
Each elder

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:06.220
has 10 votes.

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:07.950
Each of the 3 Sword Masters

00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:08.830
has 20 votes.

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:10.190
Each guest member

00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:11.020
has 30 votes.

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:12.590
The presiding Sword Master

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:13.390
has 50 votes.

00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:16.050
The candidate with the most votes

00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:18.540
will be elected as Sword Master.

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:19.740
Over the past 15 days,

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:20.870
we have tallied the votes

00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:22.270
from regular disciples.

00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:23.460
Master Jiang Wenbo

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:24.720
is temporarily acting

00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:26.980
as the Branch Chief
of the Investigation Hall.

00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:27.980
Disciples under his command

00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:29.180
amount to 124 people.

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:30.260
Twelve of them

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:31.450
vote for Tang Lici.

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:32.700
Ninety-seven of them

00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:34.000
vote for Xifang Tao.

00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:35.020
Fifteen of them

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:36.560
vote for Zhong Chunji.

00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:37.540
Among

00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:38.910
the 138 disciples

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:40.220
led by Shangguan Fei,

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:41.550

and 30 vote for

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:49.540
Zhong Chunji.

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:53.680
The Branch Chief of the Service Hall,
Xiao Qilan,

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:54.870
commands

00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:56.790
155 disciples.

00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:58.430
Forty-three of them

00:23:58.500 --> 00:23:59.560
vote for Tang Lici.

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:00.830
Eighty vote for

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:01.720
Xifang Tao.

00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:03.320
Thirty-two vote for

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:04.300
Zhong Chunji.

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:05.570
In summary,

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:06.670
among the Sword Alliance's

00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:07.800

00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:09.670

and 322

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:20.500
Now, Sword Masters and Elders,

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:21.830
please cast your votes.

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:28.300

the 16 elders of the Service Hall

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:36.060
and the Investigation Hall,

00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:38.000
all vote for Xifang Tao.

00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:49.740
Add 200 more votes...

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:51.540

00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:54.980
Shangguan Fei and the 6 elders

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:55.950

00:24:56.150 --> 00:24:57.210
vote for Tang Lici.

00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:58.850
Good boy.

00:24:59.110 --> 00:24:59.870
I knew you'd turn out great.

00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:00.930
Senior, Senior...

00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:02.510
Here you are.

00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:02.900
[Xue Xianzi votes for Tang Lici]

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:03.760
I, Xue Xianzi,

00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:05.670
also vote for Tang Lici.

00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:06.150
Good.

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:07.470
Very good.

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:15.390
Add 90 more votes

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:16.350
to Tang Lici.

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:20.010
I, Shao Yanping,

00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:24.870
vote for Tang Lici.

00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:32.500
Add 50 more votes

to Tang Lici.

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:35.940
Master Cheng and Master Puzhu

00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:37.770
are absent from the election.

00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:38.630
So, we will now

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:40.150
proceed to count the ballots.

00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:40.880
Zhong Chunji

00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:42.190
received 322 votes.

00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:43.390
Tang Lici

00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:44.800
received 650 votes.

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:45.950
Xifang Tao

00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:48.670
received 680 votes.

00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:58.080
Miss Xifang got 680 votes?

00:25:58.110 --> 00:25:58.780
I misjudged it.

00:25:58.780 --> 00:25:59.870
Miss Xifang got quite a lot of votes.

00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:00.670
Therefore...

00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:02.870
Master Cheng asked me

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:04.800
to give this to the Sword Alliance.

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:09.020
Mr. Tang?

00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:12.150
He finally arrived.

It seems both of you

00:27:36.910 --> 00:27:38.110
are equally favored.

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:42.010
Given this result,

00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:43.780
I voluntarily

00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:45.700
offer all the votes I got

00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:48.150
to another candidate.

00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:50.870
I-Is that even allowed?

00:27:59.020 --> 00:27:59.910
I believe...

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:11.990
that candidate is the perfect fit.

00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:27.300
This person...

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:29.630
is Mr. Tang.

00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:32.540
Mr. Tang?

00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:40.830
Ms. Zhong,

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:44.860
I think of you as a friend.

00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:46.540
It's true

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:48.880
that you have your own agenda,

00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:50.460
but you do intend to do

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:52.420
what's in my best interest.

00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:53.300
Such

00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:54.590
kindness

00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:56.720
is not what I need, though.

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:12.490
You don't blame me?

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:15.090
You actually...

00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:16.700
understand me?

00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:19.540
I

00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:22.080
understand you.

00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:25.980
But I wouldn't say I don't blame you.

00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:29.020
Take this flower as an example.

00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:30.720
There will always be

00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:32.280
someone plucking it

00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:33.870
out of fondness,

00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:36.070
yet getting hurt by it

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:37.540
at the same time.

00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:40.550
Such is the entanglement

00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:42.350
of fate.

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:44.080
It's pointless

00:29:44.670 --> 00:29:45.220
to blame

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:47.900
the flower or the person.

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:49.670
The past is behind us.

00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:51.130
It's better to look ahead.

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:52.020
There are

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:54.700
more beautiful views in front of us.

00:29:57.570 --> 00:29:58.700
What's done is done.

00:29:59.020 --> 00:29:59.700
Truth

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:01.260
and falsehood

00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:03.460
no longer matter.

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:06.540
As long as the blooms are pretty,

00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:09.080
someone will find them adorable
eventually.

00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:13.850
So you've known everything
the entire time.

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:17.460
Ms. Zhong,

00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:19.220
since...

00:30:20.650 --> 00:30:22.360
you've chosen to be a princess,

00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:23.560
I hope...

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:26.590
you can be

00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:28.520
the kind of princess you wish to be.

00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:32.540
Xifang Tao said something

00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:33.270
quite right.

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:36.980
"The Sword Master
doesn't have to be the princess."

00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:39.440
"He or she can be
a friend of the princess's."

00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:51.060
Yuchi Hu!

00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:54.150
The votes received by Princess Lang Ya

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:56.090
shall be transferred to Tang Lici.

00:30:56.090 --> 00:30:57.750
Everyone, please take a look.

00:30:58.630 --> 00:30:59.300
Great!

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:03.350
So it was written beforehand!

00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:04.220
Why not tell us earlier?

00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:05.300
How dramatic!

00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:09.530
Therefore,

00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:11.270
Mr. Tang has received a total

00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:12.220
of 1,002 votes.

00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:15.590
That is to say,

00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:18.270
Mr. Tang has the most votes now.

00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:20.700
Everyone,

00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:22.610
the new Sword Master is...

00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:25.430
Tang Lici.

00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:27.630
This is great!

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:37.190
Greetings, Sword Master.

00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:55.550
Congratulations, Mr. Tang.

00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:57.020
Miss Xifang,

00:31:57.670 --> 00:31:58.500
thank you.

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:04.700
I'm wondering

00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:07.190
if you, Master Tang, will do your utmost

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:08.590
to protect

00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:09.780
the innocent.

00:32:10.910 --> 00:32:12.220
We only disagree on how to

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:13.950
deal with the poisoned people.

00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:16.890
But about capturing the head of the evil,

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:21.190
namely Liu Yan, we've always been

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:22.910
on the same page.

00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:24.830
Right?

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:36.870
It's wrong!

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:38.980
Wrong!

00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:41.260
Wrong...

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:42.710
It's wrong!

00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:45.710
Why are all the concoctions wrong?

00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:46.910
Yan!

00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:47.700
What happened?

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:48.910
That antidote was clearly working.

00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:50.310
Why would it suddenly...

00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:51.740
Yan, what are you doing?

00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:56.780
Yan, it's me.

00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:57.710
Wake up!

00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:03.920
Don't blame me.

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:10.680
Is this the antidote you made?

00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:13.060
You're still doing tests on yourself?

00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:14.460
Didn't Tang Lici tell you

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:16.190
to just present your formula

00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:17.060
to Shui Duopo?

00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:18.430
Why are you still using

00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:19.960
yourself as a test subject?

00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:22.380
Give me that bottle with yellow tassels...

00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:23.510
Be quick!

00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:29.740
Yan!

00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:32.700
The Blood Ghost Pills
contain a potent poison.

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:34.150
The cure for it is also a poison.

00:33:34.150 --> 00:33:35.540
How am I supposed to know if it's safe

00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:37.070
without testing it myself?

00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:39.700
I'll catch some poisoned people

00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:40.500
as your test subjects.

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:41.020
No!

00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:42.910
Xiaohong, do you know why Lici

00:33:42.910 --> 00:33:44.440
doesn't come here anymore?

00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:45.990
He must be facing

00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:47.740
some serious difficulties.

00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:48.980
We can't make an appearance

00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:49.980
at a time like this

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:51.860
and cause trouble to Lici.

00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:55.050
Then give me the antidote.

00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:55.950
Test it on me.

00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:56.540
No.

00:33:57.150 --> 00:33:59.110
I need you to quickly find a way
to get in contact

00:33:59.110 --> 00:34:01.020
with Shui Duopo and tell her the making

00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:02.740
of the antidote will take some more time,

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:04.390
and that hasty moves must be avoided.

00:34:04.390 --> 00:34:04.950
Yan!

00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:06.310
The time is pressing.

00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:08.010
Only the antidote can help Li.

00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:17.980
Stop it...

00:34:21.179 --> 00:34:22.750
At this rate, you'll die!

00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:24.980
What's the point of living

00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:26.580
if I can't make the antidote?

00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:27.389
Don't!

00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:35.179
Miss Shui,

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:36.760
only you and I are here.

00:34:37.139 --> 00:34:37.830
No need

00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:39.090
to focus on my illness.

00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:41.070
The antidote is more important.

00:34:45.429 --> 00:34:47.460
Your condition has finally improved a bit.

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:49.739
Though you're no longer the Sword Master,

00:34:49.739 --> 00:34:51.600
at least you're lucky to be alive.

00:34:52.429 --> 00:34:53.909
My pulse is indeed

00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:55.570
much more stable than before.

00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:56.909
Miss Shui,

00:34:57.310 --> 00:34:58.310
about that formula I showed you

00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:59.350
a few days ago...

00:34:59.870 --> 00:35:01.330
Master Shao, your medical skills

00:35:01.330 --> 00:35:03.140
have really improved remarkably.

00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:04.140
In a few more days,

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:05.730
maybe you should replace me

00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:07.350
as the Physician of Miracle.

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:08.750
I've made a pill

00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:10.010
based on that formula.

00:35:10.350 --> 00:35:11.660
Chi Yun learned about it

00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:13.390
and insisted on giving it a try.

00:35:13.870 --> 00:35:14.830
I couldn't stand his pestering,

00:35:14.830 --> 00:35:16.160
so I gave him half a pill.

00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:17.180
He also asked me

00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:18.790
to keep it secret from Tang Lici,

00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:19.730
saying that he'd give

00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:21.790
Tang Lici a surprise a few days later.

00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:23.180
It's time for Tang Lici to stop

00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:25.180
drawing blood from himself, right?

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:35.910
Thank you.

00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:41.950
I had the poisoned people escorted

00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:43.790
to the Sword King City for treatment.

00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:45.500
Those who came back from the task told me

00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:46.270
a discovery there—

00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:47.580
the Black Tuli produced by the dead

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:48.580
had disappeared.

00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:50.060
It might have been stolen

00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:52.460
by someone highly skilled in martial arts.

00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:54.840
Ghostly Peony is dead.

00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:57.160
Who else would need Black Tuli?

00:35:57.830 --> 00:35:59.830
That's what I've been thinking too.

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:04.140
Master Tang, bad news!

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:04.910
Mr. Chi...

00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:05.660
fainted.

00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:12.270
I underestimated

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:14.390
the toxicity of the Blood Ghost Pills.

00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:16.190
I thought Chi Yun had recovered.

00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:26.350
Even if you drain up

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:27.140
your blood,

00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:29.060
how many people can you save?

00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:31.190
If the antidote can't be...

00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:33.580
Come in!

00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:38.980
The antidote?

00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:40.580
Didn't you say the making of the antidote

00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:41.750
was far from completion?

00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:43.880
Why is there suddenly a breakthrough?

00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:45.060
It's great news.

00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:46.660
Why keep it from us?

00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:48.430
Senior Shui, I wonder

00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:51.430
what kind of medical expert
has offered you guidance.

00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:56.780
You have such sharp ears, Master Jiang.

00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:59.400
Who told you there was a breakthrough?

00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:04.100
Before the antidote is made,

00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:05.750
Master Tang, please keep Mr. Chi

00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:06.620
in prison,

00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:09.570
so as to soothe the nerves
of all jianghu heroes.

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:11.910
Mr. Tang,
since you're the Sword Master now,

00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:12.540
I don't think

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:14.670
you need my reminders on such matters.

00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:17.580
Senior Shui,

00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:18.910
please feed him

00:37:18.910 --> 00:37:20.710
one more Worry-Relieving Pill.

00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:21.910
When he wakes up,

00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:23.390
I will personally

00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:24.910
escort him to prison.

00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:30.980
I meant to seek a chance
to impeach Tang Lici

00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:32.440
based on Chi Yun's matter,

00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:34.140
so he'd step down as Sword Master.

00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:35.750
Yet he didn't fall for my trick.

00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:37.210
Miss Xifang, don't worry.

00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:39.180
His weaknesses will be revealed
sooner or later.

00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:40.230
Last time when I escorted prisoners

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:41.490
to the Sword King City,

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:42.350
the people there said

00:37:42.350 --> 00:37:43.660
Black Tuli had gone missing.

00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:44.870
They suspected some members

00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:46.140
of Fengliu Shop were at large

00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:47.340
and stole that thing.

00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:49.010
Is it possible that...

00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:49.620
Shut up!

00:37:54.830 --> 00:37:57.090
We've already eliminated Fengliu Shop.

00:37:57.430 --> 00:37:59.490
What members at large could there be?

00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:01.950
Stop talking nonsense.

00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:04.270
We didn't mean to speak out of turn.

00:38:04.270 --> 00:38:05.930
This matter seems rather odd.

00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:08.400
Every disciple's been talking about it.

00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:11.020
Alright.

00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:12.910
No need to make a fuss.

00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:14.870
Black Tuli decomposes

00:38:15.350 --> 00:38:17.020
on its own in an hour

00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:18.750
after leaving its host bodies.

00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:21.060
I guess the disciples are spreading

00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:23.100
false information due to lack of knowledge

00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:24.660
about the nature of this substance.

00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:26.390
There's no need to panic at all.

00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:28.310
Yes.

00:38:35.350 --> 00:38:35.910
Chi,

00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:37.490
you must've suffered.

00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:39.950
Tell me the truth.

00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:40.880
Am I beyond help?

00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:48.660
How could that be?

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:50.020
In this world,

00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:52.280
there's no poison Mr. Tang can't tackle.

00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:54.350
Plus, we have Senior Shui's help.

00:38:54.350 --> 00:38:55.180
The other disciples are just

00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:56.510
being overly cautious.

00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:58.000
You look quite well.

00:38:58.060 --> 00:38:59.660
I guess you'll recover soon.

00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:02.460
When the toxins in you are cleared,

00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:03.860
I'll treat you to drinks.

00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:06.510
Mr. Tang,

00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:07.280
goodbye.

00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:11.100
You guys,

00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:12.580
guard this cell day and night.

00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:14.140
Don't let anyone approach it.

00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:14.660
Yes.

00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:18.180
If I'll truly recover soon,

00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:19.980
why am I still chained up?

00:39:21.310 --> 00:39:21.910
Foxy Tang,

00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:23.710
are you lying to me again?

00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:25.990
When have I ever lied to you?

00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:26.970
Just relax.

00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:29.230
I'm able to cure you.

00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:30.700
Foxy Tang,

00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:31.460
I saw

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:33.060
what the poison did to Jiang Cheng,

00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:33.870
and heard

00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:35.730
what Jiang Wenbo and others said.

00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:36.980
Just tell me the truth.

00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:37.660
Am I...

00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:39.140
beyond help?

00:39:41.830 --> 00:39:42.960
Since it's a poison,

00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:45.580
there must be an antidote for it.

00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:46.100
What?

00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:48.200
You don't trust me?

00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:49.430
I do.

00:39:50.350 --> 00:39:51.100
Now, except you,

00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:52.230
a white-haired fox,

00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:54.040
who else can I trust?

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:00.230
Drink this up.

00:40:03.830 --> 00:40:05.160
Why is this stuff again?

00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:06.920
It tastes like rust.

00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:09.930
Do you want to drink it yourself,

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:10.980
or let me get in,

00:40:11.350 --> 00:40:12.610
press your acupoints,

00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:13.910
and pour it down your throat?

00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:14.310
You're

00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:17.350
bullying me

00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:19.150
just because I'm chained up now.

00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:28.910
You'll feel better
when you get used to it.

00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:29.710
Get used to it?

00:40:30.350 --> 00:40:32.150
I have to drink that stuff again?

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:33.770
Take it or leave it.

00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:37.110
What does that mean?

00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:40.750
D-Don't leave, Foxy Tang!

00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:41.680
Explain it to me!

00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:43.710
Don't leave!

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:45.690
Explain what you just said!

00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:46.950
Foxy Tang!

00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:58.580
Xifang Tao probably have doubts

00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:00.580
about the origin of the formula now.

00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:03.260
Liu Yan's location must not be exposed.

00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:04.910
My blood

00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:06.270
can no longer fully suppress

00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:07.470
the toxins in Chi Yun.

00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:11.100
Shui Duopo's recent experiments

00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:12.760
have produced zero progress.

00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:26.230
It seems

00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:28.950
I'll have to try making blood serum.

00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:44.460
Though the process is complex,

00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:45.460
and the cost huge,

00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:46.830
blood serum

00:41:46.830 --> 00:41:48.490
is more effective than blood.

00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:24.470
A new poison emerged,

00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:26.190
and the crystal was stolen.

00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:27.870
Those were not coincidences.

00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:30.910
Those who take the Blood Ghost Pill

00:42:30.910 --> 00:42:32.510
will produce a black crystal

00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:34.740
called Black Tuli inside their bodies.

00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:37.390
It's the best nourishment
for the bronze tree.

00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:39.720
Xifang Tao never left the Sword Alliance.

00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:40.870
Who has kept

00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:42.980
stealing the crystal?

00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:46.950
And was that dream...

00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:48.830
really just a dream?

00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:51.870
We both come from the same place.

00:42:51.870 --> 00:42:53.310
Soon, our homeland

00:42:53.310 --> 00:42:55.100
will descend upon Shenzhou.

00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:57.390
Tang Lici,

00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:59.600
you know where to find me.

00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:17.060
He has repaired his body so quickly.

00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:18.740
How many more secrets

00:43:18.910 --> 00:43:20.710
are there about the bronze tree?

00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:22.750
It's almost dawn.

00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:24.110
You'd better...

00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:26.060
leave right away.
