00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.640
Dad, what are you doing here?

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.640
Why?

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.880
The Nine Immortals' Compass

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.640
Dad, why are you here?

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.040
Why, Dad?

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.040
Dad

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.680
Eighth Master, what's going on here?

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.800
You got me out of that kid's hands

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.040
Didn't we agree on this?

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.960
I went to see Boss He

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.400
Tricked that kid into going up the mountain

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.760
I planned to take his Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.800
and the Nine Immortals' Compass

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.520
Then we'd find the Celestial Grotto

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.440
and discover the treasure

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.520
We'd split it fifty-fifty

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.760
Half for each of us?

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.680
What's this about?

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.560
Old Duan

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.880
Your biggest advantage

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.960
is your obsession with money

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.440
For money, you'll do anything

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.760
Anything at all

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.000
Eighth Master, no matter what, we're sworn

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.160
sworn brothers

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.680
You promised me

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.960
Once we find the Celestial Grotto

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.360
endless wealth and glory

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.800
for us

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.040
Old Duan

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.080
You’re wise your whole life, foolish for a moment

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.560
All for a grotto that doesn't even exist

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.000
Scheming so desperately

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.320
For what?

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.160
The Celestial Grotto is just a myth

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.480
The real secret is the Ginseng Spirit Ritual

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.080
It can bring the dead to life

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.000
restore flesh to bone

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.040
grant immortality

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.440
For decades, the Ginseng Guild

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.520
fought over the Nine Immortals' Compass

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.720
and the century-old Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.200
were never keys to the grotto

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.560
They're just essential for the ritual

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.960
And this ritual

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.760
must be done when the Mountain God descends

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.840
The Mountain God appears every sixty years

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.200
For this moment

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.400
I've plotted for thirty years

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.960
Feeding ginseng with human blood for years

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.120
Then eating the blood-fed ginseng

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.120
But what I didn't expect

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.840
was three years ago

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.920
the blood-fed ginseng made me

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.680
grow ginseng whiskers all over

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.400
Those are blood-borne mycelium

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.680
poisoning my body

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.280
Because of these whiskers

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.320
I have to wrap myself up year after year

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.320
afraid to go outside

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.320
I know

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.200
the ginseng spirit is calling me

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.040
Old Yang, you tricked me

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.920
So it’s true

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.560
Those fiends

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.120
were raising blood slaves for you

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.840
That's right

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.680
Those greedy merchants

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.040
even swapped out my ginseng

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.120
Do you know

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:21.480
because of you

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.280
how many died in the blood slave den?

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.120
Old, young

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.280
all ages

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.200
The youngest was not even ten

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.320
His parents watched helplessly

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.960
as his blood

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.680
was drained away

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.120
and he died before their eyes

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.320
You beast, beast

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.120
Those wretches all deserved to die

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.200
And you all

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.480
Especially you

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.400
You're as useless as your father

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.680
Always clinging to your worthless principles

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:54.840
Utterly foolish

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.040
My father

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.120
You killed him

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.120
That's right, it's me.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.680
And him, Master Duan.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:10.960
And that Lin, the seventh.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.960
The one named Yang.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.680
I'll kill you, Yang Chengye.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.680
You... you jerk!

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.480
Three years ago, on the southern slope,

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.840
I found a giant ginseng growing.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.720
I knew the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.280
had finally appeared.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.160
Old Duan...

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.440
This Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng
has now emerged.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.280
If we can dig up this ginseng,

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.680
for our Ginseng Guild,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
it would be a great honor.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.600
And with this Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.720
plus the Nine Immortals' Compass
in Old Jin's hands,

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.040
we can open the Celestial Grotto.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.560
Then endless riches and glory await us.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.440
Brother Eight, you're absolutely right.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.320
Our Ginseng Guild is struggling these days.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.440
We barely earn anything.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.400
If things go as you say,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.720
then for the rest of our lives,

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.000
we'll enjoy endless wealth and glory.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.680
To make this happen,

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.160
we must ask Old Jin to join us.

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:12.160
Old Jin.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.600
So,

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.960
take advantage of the Grand Mountain Assembly.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.320
Go invite Old Jin to join us.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.760
With Old Jin's skills,

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.040
he's our best chance to dig up
the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.040
And with the compass in his hands,

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.600
the Nine Immortals' Compass,

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.840
Master Eight.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.160
That's brilliant, truly brilliant.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:33.560
Stop dawdling, let's go.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.160
Old Jin, let's go.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:35.880
Old Jin, wait—

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.040
Enough already, let's go.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.320
I'm giving you respect here.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.320
I knew I couldn't count on your father.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.440
But I didn't expect, at the Grand Mountain Assembly,

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.200
your father showed up uninvited.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.880
He even offered to help our Ginseng Guild dig ginseng.

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.400
So I made him the lead immortal.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.280
He led the Jin family to the temple
to pray to the mountain god.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.680
But on the day of the Grand Mountain Assembly,

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.160
I secretly overheard your father and Jin Lizhong

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.440
whispering,

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.320
they weren't here to dig up ginseng.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.600
They wanted to move the giant ginseng.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.440
Luckily, I had Lin the seventh

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.880
set up traps in the temple ahead of time.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.160
When your father brought the whole family

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.160
to pray at the mountain god's temple,

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.040
I killed every single one of them.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.320
Yang Chengye!

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:29.880
You bastard!

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.160
I'll kill you!

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.320
Let's see who's tougher,

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.200
you or me.

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.160
Stop struggling.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.040
It's useless.

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:38.720
Give me just one more incense's time,

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.720
and you'll all be dead.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:53.600
Ruyi...

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.720
You're the most important person
in my life.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.440
Without you, I can't finish this ritual.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.160
This ritual

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.600
needs not only the Nine Immortals' Compass

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.000
and the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng,

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.000
but something even more vital.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:15.160
It requires the blood of parent and child.

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:17.160
Ruyi...

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.440
You're the most sensible one.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.720
Only by completing this final step

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.440
will the ginseng whiskers on my body

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:29.880
completely disappear.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:33.560
And I'll gain eternal life.

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:35.840
Father...

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.200
Father...

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.720
You'll live forever.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.440
Eternal life...

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:46.520
Quick, get the compass back!

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:48.720
Thirteen, watch out!

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:52.800
Careful with the compass!

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.720
Jinzi, watch your back!

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:01.720
Brother Thirteen!

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:02.600
Watch out!

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.520
Jinzi, watch your back!

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.160
Baobao...

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:24.240
Baobao...

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.280
No, please!

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.160
No!

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:58.280
Baobao...

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.160
Baobao... Baobao...

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:33.960
Let me go!

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.840
Baobao... Baobao...

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.800
Haiyue, don't cry.

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.160
Baobao...

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:12.280
Baobao...

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:14.280
Baobao...

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.080
Jin Shisan.

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:38.640
Yang Chengye.

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.360
I, and all the Jin family,

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.720
had no grudge against you.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:51.520
Yet you slaughtered us all.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.520
And countless innocents you drained of blood.

00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:58.640
Now,

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.640
even your own daughter,

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:03.520
you won't spare.

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:07.720
Yang Chengye, your sins are grave.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:09.720
Heaven cannot tolerate you.

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.600
I wish I could cut you to pieces.

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.400
Tear you limb from limb.

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:17.960
With your head,

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:22.600
I'll honor all those you killed.

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.800
May their spirits rest in peace.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.480
If you could live forever,

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:30.480
that would be the greatest injustice.

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:33.080
Is that what you want?

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:35.280
Thirteen...

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:36.600
Let's talk this out.

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:37.400
Do you know

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.480
there's a Ginseng Spirit Crystal
in this compass?

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:40.480
If it shatters,

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.400
its energy will backfire on everyone.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:43.600
Today,

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:45.400
I, Jin Shisan,

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.280
will act on heaven's behalf.

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:50.640
Thirteen...

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:00.160
When I smashed the compass,

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.600
the Ginseng Spirit Crystal's energy burst out,

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.600
resonating with the Azure Dragon Ridge's magnetism,

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:10.600
pulling everyone into a world of obsession.

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.280
CONGRATULATIONS, MASTER, ON ETERNAL LIFE.

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:28.480
CONGRATULATIONS, MASTER, ON ETERNAL LIFE.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.800
CONGRATULATIONS, MASTER, ON ETERNAL LIFE.

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:44.400
Master Duan...

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:45.520
MAY YOU LIVE AS LONG AS THE SOUTHERN MOUNTAIN.

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:46.280
MAY YOU LIVE AS LONG AS THE SOUTHERN MOUNTAIN.

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:48.240
MAY FORTUNE BLESS YOU, MASTER DUAN.

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:50.400
You're a truly good man.

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:51.960
Thirteen...

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:06.640
Master Duan...

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:07.720
It didn't break.

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:29.840
You slept really well.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:32.600
Dad.

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:33.960
Let me cover you with the blanket.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:35.600
Still half asleep.

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:37.040
Hurry up and start your training.

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:38.920
Stand right there.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.040
Hold your horse stance.

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:47.720
Punch with strength.

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.080
Keep your arms straight.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:51.840
Dad.

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:53.160
Thirteen.

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.040
Time to eat.

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:55.360
Ignore him for now.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:55.960
Let him keep practicing.

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:57.160
Put it over there.

00:15:58.480 --> 00:15:59.280
Eyes forward.

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:03.840
Straighten up.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:04.720
Chest out.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:05.280
Stomach in.

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:08.240
Keep practicing until I say stop.

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:15.400
Dad.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.720
Do you think Thirteen is acting strange today?

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:21.160
Seems like he is, a little.

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:22.600
He looks dazed.

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:27.160
You hit him so hard with your pipe, he’s out of it.

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.040
That was nothing.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.800
Next time, I’ll use the pickaxe handle.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:36.400
How can an eighteen-year-old be so soft?

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:47.840
Tell him to come eat.

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:51.040
Okay.

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:52.360
Thirteen.

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:53.920
Eat.

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:55.280
Eat.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:16:59.160
Sit.

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:00.240
I’ll get you some porridge.

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:03.600
Eat while holding your horse stance.

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:05.040
Dad.

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:09.640
Eat your vegetables.

00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:15.600
Dad.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:16.720
Xing’er.

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:18.960
Seeing you all

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:20.160
is really nice.

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:23.840
I told you, you knocked him silly.

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:24.960
He’s talking nonsense now.

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:26.960
You can’t hit him next time.

00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:28.520
You’ll have to kick him instead.
