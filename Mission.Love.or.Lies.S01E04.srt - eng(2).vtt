Hey Achi, what are you doing?

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.840
I just want you to notice that when you touch me,

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.840
do you still feel butterflies like when you first got close to me?

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.040
Think about it carefully.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.920
During this time, who have you been with that makes you feel special or happier than before?

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.960
When you're quiet, not talking, not being annoying,

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.640
you're actually quite cute.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.000
I'm getting charmed.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.200
What? You want to go home?

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.640
Please, Achi.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.680
Please, Achi.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.160

Kitty, Nunthaphuck Aranyakasemsuk as Chama

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.640
Alice, are you okay?

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.360
I think you should wait here. We won't be long.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.720
No, I'm fine now. I feel better.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.560
Let me go with everyone. Please.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.280
Let Alice go too. That way my father won't worry.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.800
I'll break the rules to help you just this once, Patty.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.160
Thank you.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.400
I promise I won't cause you any trouble,

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.960
and I won't ask you for anything again.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.960
But we don't have much time. You need to be careful too.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.000
Let's go. Get in the car.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.080
Why is senior so kind?

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.680
Well... we work on the same team, so we have to take care of each other.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.720
I see.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.280
Dad.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.040
How are you, sweetheart? Are you doing well?

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.520
I'm fine.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.240
How's everything?

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.720
I miss you so much. How are you doing?

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.480
I'm in the car right now, heading to see you at home.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.960
Really?

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.520
Will it be dangerous?

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.440
No, it won't.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.680
I just want to see your face for a moment, then I'll come right back.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.520
Wait for me at the main gate, okay Dad?

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.480
See you, Dad.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:06.480
Okay.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:35.920
Inspector Tee.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.480
My daughter is coming home today.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.280
But she probably won't stay long, just a quick visit.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.840
Please don't scold her.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.600
Because I really miss my daughter too.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.000
Okay.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:10.480
Patty!

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.200
Dad!

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:14.720
I've missed you so much, sweetheart.

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.200
I've missed you too, Dad.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.920
How are you?

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.760
I'm doing well.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:35.680
Take care of Patty.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.920
Dad!

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.240
Dad!

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.520
Chama, watch Patty.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.000
Dad!

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.600
Hey! Patty!

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.280
Dad, wake up!

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.680
Dad, wake up!

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.760
Wake up, Dad. Listen to me.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.000
Dad, don't leave me, Dad.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.760
Dad!

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.920
Dad!

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:10.800
Dad!

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.600
Get up!

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:15.760
Go!

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.240
Your father is dead.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.680
Do you want to die with your father?

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:20.480
Come!

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.720
Let go! Let go!

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:23.600
Go!

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:25.880
Go! Go!

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:27.400
Alice!

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.480
Hey!

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:29.920
Hey!

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.320
Patty!

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.680
Breaking news, viewers.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.840
Mr. Phirom Siwatchaponkonkai,

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:44.280
a famous former politician, was shot while talking to his daughter,

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.080
and died instantly at the front of his house.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:53.400
At the same time, the same CCTV camera
captured an unlicensed vehicle,

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:59.600
and a man in black grabbed Patty and her friend's arms and forced them into the car away from the scene.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:04.920
This incident is considered a brazen act that shows no fear of the law.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.240
We can't wait any longer.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.600
We need to do something now.

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:09.840
I understand.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:13.320
But we can't just rush in randomly.
There are only two of us.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.320
Yeah, that's true.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.360
We don't know how many of them there are.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.280
Right.

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:23.480
We need to plan this carefully. Otherwise, both of us will die for sure.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.440
But we should hurry.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.360
I'm afraid it might be too late.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.200
If we delay, who knows what might happen.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.400
I really want to know who they are.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.120
I can't figure it out at all.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.240
I don't know either.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:41.080
Normally, Mr. Phirom didn't have any enemies.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:47.760
And Miss Patty never mentioned anyone her father didn't get along with.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:50.880
What?

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.560
Mr. Phirom and Miss Patty?

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.480
Sigh...

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:02.720
Sit down!

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.840
If you have something to say, say it.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:10.480
I'm sorry.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.880
Please don't be angry at us. It was necessary.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.760
Besides, I didn't want Miss Patty to be in danger either.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.160
So I had to do this.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.160
I'm such a disgrace as a detective.

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:29.760
Don't you know that impersonating Miss Patty like this is extremely risky?

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:31.880
You're literally putting yourself on the line.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.320
Why wouldn't I know?

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.920
You must really love Miss Patty.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:40.680
Yes.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:42.880
I love her very much.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.840
Like a real younger sister.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:59.640
So when you were here, you've been helping Miss Patty all along.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.360
Yes.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:06.360
Well, thinking about it, you two are quite similar.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.360
So we almost got caught?

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:13.240
Yeah, especially that Miss Patty. What kind of bodyguard talks like that?

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.200
Annoying. So annoying.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.120
Annoying. Annoying.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:18.760
Yeah.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:23.200
But someone around here secretly fell in love with her, right?

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:25.760
You know?

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:28.760
Yeah, I could feel it.

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.160
Whatever. Forget it.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:37.800
I think I've figured out a plan for how to help those two.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:38.960
Really?

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:40.840
Tell me.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:41.960
You lead.

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:44.320
I'll follow.

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:45.920
Let's do this.

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.080
I'm ready.

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:31.400
I'm ready too.

00:11:50.362 --> 00:11:53.246
Supported by Pro Fresh Milk

00:11:55.861 --> 00:11:57.728
What do you want? Americano?

00:11:58.741 --> 00:12:00.788
I prefer it with milk.

00:12:01.328 --> 00:12:05.272
Then I recommend this menu. Just add this milk and it's guaranteed to be delicious.

00:12:09.178 --> 00:12:10.733
We use Pro Fresh milk,

00:12:10.738 --> 00:12:13.158
which can enhance the flavor of coffee very well.

00:12:13.158 --> 00:12:16.158
It froths easily and has a smooth, mellow taste.

00:12:33.558 --> 00:12:34.771
Mmm.

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:36.775
It tastes so professional.

00:12:37.276 --> 00:12:38.358
That good?

00:12:40.236 --> 00:12:41.668
Can I have one cup, please?

00:12:44.792 --> 00:12:45.728
Ready.

00:12:46.348 --> 00:12:47.819
Let's go.

00:13:03.878 --> 00:13:05.402
You should wait here.

00:13:06.219 --> 00:13:07.760
No, I'm going with you.

00:13:08.952 --> 00:13:12.628
We don't know how dangerous it is ahead or what we'll encounter.

00:13:12.818 --> 00:13:14.868
Staying here is safer.

00:13:15.335 --> 00:13:16.623
But we already talked about this.

00:13:17.178 --> 00:13:18.354
I want to go.

00:13:18.581 --> 00:13:19.739
But I'm a police officer.

00:13:20.299 --> 00:13:22.244
I have to protect everyone.

00:13:22.248 --> 00:13:24.838
But you can't do this job alone, Achi.

00:13:25.158 --> 00:13:27.672
Don't forget that I'm a national-level shooting athlete.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.914
If you want to succeed, you need me there.

00:13:32.068 --> 00:13:33.613
- But...
- Don't "but" me.

00:13:33.618 --> 00:13:35.061
And don't worry.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:39.390
I've been through this kind of thing before. I know what I'm dealing with.

00:13:40.501 --> 00:13:41.642
And another thing,

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:45.453
I also want to protect my younger sister and the person I love.

00:13:46.463 --> 00:13:47.225
Okay.

00:13:47.385 --> 00:13:49.061
Let's go then. Let's do this!

00:13:56.738 --> 00:13:59.091
I think if we keep going straight, we should be there.

00:13:59.188 --> 00:14:01.394
Yeah, good thing you know the way.

00:14:02.223 --> 00:14:06.737
Yeah, really lucky that they didn't know Patty had her phone with her.

00:14:08.198 --> 00:14:11.398
Did you worry so much that you had to put a GPS on her?

00:14:11.697 --> 00:14:13.221
Well, just in case.

00:14:14.649 --> 00:14:17.242
Is Patty's life really that dangerous?

00:14:17.651 --> 00:14:18.948
You could say that.

00:14:19.499 --> 00:14:21.790
And it's really sad too.

00:14:22.148 --> 00:14:22.969
Why?

00:14:24.846 --> 00:14:28.598
Well, she wasn't even 10 years old in Thailand when her mother died.

00:14:28.598 --> 00:14:31.853
Just one day later, she had to go abroad for safety.

00:14:32.779 --> 00:14:34.846
And when she came back to Thailand, she still had to hide.

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:36.653
Yes.

00:14:37.739 --> 00:14:40.846
But I think Patty seems fierce.

00:14:42.025 --> 00:14:44.703
She's fierce to hide her weakness.

00:14:44.977 --> 00:14:45.781
Really?

00:14:45.975 --> 00:14:48.257
Really. When she was there,

00:14:48.258 --> 00:14:51.562
whenever she talked to her uncle on the phone, she would sit and cry alone every time.

00:14:54.484 --> 00:14:55.328
Let's go.

00:14:57.798 --> 00:14:59.314
I don't know what it's like inside.

00:14:59.598 --> 00:15:02.139
Looking at the condition, it's probably been abandoned for several years.

00:15:02.813 --> 00:15:05.870
Um, should we split up?

00:15:06.337 --> 00:15:07.078
Okay.

00:15:09.335 --> 00:15:12.128
I see an entrance on one side. I'll go that way.

00:15:12.703 --> 00:15:13.524
I'll go this way.

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:14.741
Okay. Got it.

00:15:17.095 --> 00:15:18.000
I'm ready.

00:15:18.404 --> 00:15:19.328
I'm ready too.

00:15:19.697 --> 00:15:20.638
Don't be careless.

00:15:20.834 --> 00:15:21.728
You too.

00:15:22.333 --> 00:15:22.638
Let's go!

00:15:22.638 --> 00:15:23.655
Hey! Wait a second.

00:15:23.878 --> 00:15:27.958
I promise that if we both survive this, I'll set you up with Miss Patty.

00:15:28.476 --> 00:15:29.878
Okay, thanks.

00:15:30.128 --> 00:15:33.141
But if you like someone, tell me. I'll play matchmaker for you.

00:15:33.381 --> 00:15:34.038
Okay.

00:15:34.038 --> 00:15:35.112
- Go!
- Good luck.

00:16:01.448 --> 00:16:02.258
Oh.

00:16:03.728 --> 00:16:04.468
Officer Tee.

00:16:06.178 --> 00:16:08.198
Did you come to help Chama and Patty too?

00:16:08.238 --> 00:16:08.778
Yes.

00:16:09.508 --> 00:16:10.928
I'm sorry, officer.

00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:13.078
For taking Patty out without telling you.

00:16:13.078 --> 00:16:14.198
And causing all this trouble.

00:16:14.558 --> 00:16:15.368
It's okay.

00:16:16.478 --> 00:16:18.128
But I'm not just sitting around doing nothing.

00:16:19.258 --> 00:16:20.578
Let's finish this matter first.

00:16:20.578 --> 00:16:22.228
Then you can punish me however you want.

00:16:22.228 --> 00:16:23.758
I'll accept all responsibility.

00:16:24.188 --> 00:16:25.558
Okay. Don't overthink it.

00:16:25.878 --> 00:16:27.538
I'll go ahead first.

00:16:30.368 --> 00:16:33.118
Wow, how long has no one been here?

00:16:46.038 --> 00:16:46.708
Achi!

00:16:47.238 --> 00:16:47.908
Achi!

00:16:48.638 --> 00:16:49.378
Achi!

00:16:49.968 --> 00:16:50.468
Achi!

00:16:50.478 --> 00:16:51.018
Hey!

00:16:51.308 --> 00:16:51.878
Achi!

00:16:51.878 --> 00:16:52.668
What the hell is this?

00:16:53.238 --> 00:16:55.018
Patty, Chama.

00:16:59.588 --> 00:17:00.418
Aunt Pin.

00:17:02.248 --> 00:17:02.968
What the hell is this?

00:17:03.158 --> 00:17:04.928
Well, awake now, darling?

00:17:06.468 --> 00:17:07.418
Officer Tee.

00:17:07.988 --> 00:17:09.848
Yes, it's me.

00:17:10.358 --> 00:17:11.498
Or...

00:17:12.158 --> 00:17:15.378
It's exactly what you're thinking. You're right.

00:17:16.098 --> 00:17:18.968
How could you do this? You're a police officer!

00:17:20.048 --> 00:17:22.058
Yes, I'm a police officer.

00:17:22.928 --> 00:17:23.718
So what?

00:17:24.328 --> 00:17:25.398
You're despicable.

00:17:26.238 --> 00:17:28.068
You can't say that.

00:17:28.148 --> 00:17:29.168
Actually,

00:17:29.388 --> 00:17:33.858
I just needed to deal with that old man Phirom and his daughter. That's all.

00:17:34.358 --> 00:17:37.838
But because of your nosiness, getting involved,

00:17:38.358 --> 00:17:40.158
everything got out of hand.

00:17:40.668 --> 00:17:42.738
I'm putting you where you should be.

00:17:43.118 --> 00:17:45.238
If you hadn't interfered like this,

00:17:45.358 --> 00:17:48.968
Pin and I would have closed this job a long time ago.

00:17:54.538 --> 00:17:55.958
Why did you do this?

00:17:56.528 --> 00:17:57.948
How can you be so stupid?

00:17:58.488 --> 00:18:00.848
It's because of money. What else would it be?

00:18:01.078 --> 00:18:04.488
Is that all? Isn't that too simple?

00:18:04.758 --> 00:18:05.388
Yeah.

00:18:05.758 --> 00:18:07.238
Yes, that simple.

00:18:08.638 --> 00:18:11.428
What a waste that I loved and respected you like a real brother.

00:18:11.958 --> 00:18:13.558
If you want to blame someone,

00:18:14.238 --> 00:18:15.938
you should blame your father.

00:18:16.368 --> 00:18:19.928
He didn't love his children equally. He lied, he cheated.

00:18:20.618 --> 00:18:23.378
In the end, he loved his biological child like you more than me.

00:18:23.728 --> 00:18:26.058
He took me in just for show.

00:18:26.438 --> 00:18:29.938
I don't even get to use the family name.

00:18:30.358 --> 00:18:31.628
Think about it.

00:18:32.078 --> 00:18:33.658
Don't talk about Dad like that.

00:18:34.658 --> 00:18:36.438
He's your father too.

00:18:37.028 --> 00:18:39.058
Stop fighting, you two.

00:18:41.528 --> 00:18:43.068
Let's start the game.

00:18:43.398 --> 00:18:46.448
I don't want to be slow. I don't want to stay here long.

00:18:46.998 --> 00:18:50.008
Dad is already dead. What more does Mom want?

00:18:50.178 --> 00:18:50.858
Hmph!

00:18:52.678 --> 00:18:55.718
You too. Hard to kill.

00:18:58.108 --> 00:19:03.228
I sent thugs to kill you abroad so many times, but you always survived.

00:19:04.738 --> 00:19:08.478
But today, you probably won't survive.

00:19:12.308 --> 00:19:16.358
What did Dad and I do to upset you so much that you'd do this?

00:19:22.238 --> 00:19:25.828
You want to know? I'll explain it to you.

00:19:27.838 --> 00:19:31.058
Do you know that before your father got with your mother,

00:19:31.908 --> 00:19:33.988
he was with me first?

00:19:35.308 --> 00:19:37.438
Your father said he loved me so much.

00:19:39.648 --> 00:19:41.528
Asked me to wait 3 months,

00:19:42.958 --> 00:19:45.968
and he'd bring elders with a million-baht dowry to propose.

00:19:47.748 --> 00:19:49.538
In the end, before the month was over,

00:19:52.438 --> 00:19:56.188
he went and married Lady Ravi, your mother.

00:19:58.468 --> 00:20:01.518
Is your mother prettier than me? No.

00:20:03.478 --> 00:20:05.708
Better than me? Not at all.

00:20:06.468 --> 00:20:07.808
Do you know what the difference was?

00:20:09.728 --> 00:20:10.928
She had money.

00:20:12.638 --> 00:20:13.708
She had honor.

00:20:14.228 --> 00:20:15.608
She had dignity.

00:20:16.508 --> 00:20:18.358
Plus, she was a politician's daughter.

00:20:19.668 --> 00:20:21.818
That's why your father left me.

00:20:24.988 --> 00:20:28.888
He left me to give birth to a daughter alone

00:20:30.288 --> 00:20:31.828
in a shabby rented room.

00:20:32.638 --> 00:20:33.498
A daughter.

00:20:35.558 --> 00:20:36.298
Yes.

00:20:37.238 --> 00:20:38.528
I remember.

00:20:39.968 --> 00:20:41.128
I struggled.

00:20:41.688 --> 00:20:43.048
I called your father.

00:20:44.718 --> 00:20:47.488
Just asked him to help with a little child support.

00:20:48.948 --> 00:20:50.438
But your father never answered.

00:20:51.238 --> 00:20:52.558
I went to his workplace.

00:20:54.508 --> 00:20:58.808
Security chased me away like a pig, like a dog.

00:20:59.768 --> 00:21:00.468
Hmph!

00:21:01.618 --> 00:21:03.618
But after your mother died,

00:21:05.168 --> 00:21:07.328
he came running to me right away.

00:21:11.838 --> 00:21:12.638
A daughter.

00:21:13.298 --> 00:21:14.318
Don't tell me...

00:21:20.928 --> 00:21:22.138
A daughter.

00:21:22.468 --> 00:21:23.258
Yes.

00:21:25.328 --> 00:21:27.418
The daughter who grew up until now

00:21:28.568 --> 00:21:30.008
is Alice.

00:21:32.528 --> 00:21:34.998
The person you've been hooking up with all this time, Patty.

00:21:40.818 --> 00:21:42.438
That Patty must die.

00:22:04.426 --> 00:22:08.116
Sponsored by Loft Bangkok Hotel

00:22:09.529 --> 00:22:11.954
CANALIS Airport Hotel

00:22:17.344 --> 00:22:18.704
Did you come alone, Achi?

00:22:19.326 --> 00:22:20.662
Yeah, alone.

00:22:22.009 --> 00:22:23.049
I don't believe you.

00:22:23.411 --> 00:22:26.380
Normally that Patty girl likes to come with her servant.

00:22:26.645 --> 00:22:27.849
Where's that other one?

00:22:29.277 --> 00:22:31.773
If she came, you'd see her. Do you see her?

00:22:33.597 --> 00:22:35.176
Are you talking about Alice?

00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:36.599
Yes.

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:38.594
I thought she'd definitely follow.

00:22:39.525 --> 00:22:41.390
But Alice is my daughter.

00:22:41.803 --> 00:22:45.816
But Pin's daughter doesn't act like a daughter at all.

00:22:46.203 --> 00:22:47.340
She's on the enemy's side.

00:22:47.601 --> 00:22:48.691
Think about it, Pin.

00:22:48.806 --> 00:22:51.316
Right now our plan is almost successful.

00:22:51.639 --> 00:22:53.609
Pin is about to have billions.

00:22:53.716 --> 00:22:56.157
Would Pin allow anyone to ruin our plan?

00:22:58.536 --> 00:22:59.268
Never.

00:23:00.834 --> 00:23:02.413
But can I talk to her myself?

00:23:03.416 --> 00:23:04.266
Fine.

00:23:05.096 --> 00:23:06.700
But if she ruins our plan,

00:23:07.201 --> 00:23:10.704
I can't guarantee your daughter's safety, Pin.

00:23:15.765 --> 00:23:17.281
Hey, you two.

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:21.811
Go check if anyone followed us.

00:23:22.409 --> 00:23:23.188
Yes, Boss.

00:23:28.248 --> 00:23:29.768
Are you okay, Chama?

00:23:31.883 --> 00:23:34.516
Patty, I'm scared.

00:23:35.373 --> 00:23:36.291
Don't be scared.

00:23:36.961 --> 00:23:40.194
We'll get home safely for sure. Trust me.

00:23:41.045 --> 00:23:42.561
Will anyone come to help us?

00:23:43.171 --> 00:23:44.116
Yes.

00:23:44.839 --> 00:23:46.434
I think Alice is probably here somewhere.

00:23:47.264 --> 00:23:48.788
Alice won't get caught, right?

00:23:49.727 --> 00:23:52.018
No way. Alice is incredibly skilled.

00:23:52.902 --> 00:23:55.900
She won't get caught and will come rescue us safely for sure.

00:24:18.127 --> 00:24:18.916
Mom.

00:24:28.576 --> 00:24:31.136
The situation is normal, Boss.

00:24:31.361 --> 00:24:33.003
No strangers entered the warehouse.

00:24:33.136 --> 00:24:34.030
How is that possible?

00:24:34.851 --> 00:24:36.127
Are you two sure?

00:24:36.641 --> 00:24:37.668
Positive, Boss.

00:24:38.409 --> 00:24:40.700
We two checked every corner.

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:43.209
Alright then.

00:24:43.314 --> 00:24:47.394
If there's nothing, you two go do your duties.

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:48.916
Yes, Boss.

00:25:02.826 --> 00:25:03.618
Alice.

00:25:07.046 --> 00:25:08.422
It must be Alice for sure.

00:25:20.325 --> 00:25:21.180
P'Tee

00:25:21.357 --> 00:25:22.291
P'Tee

00:25:27.706 --> 00:25:28.801
Don't, Mom.

00:25:30.376 --> 00:25:31.331
That's enough.

00:25:32.418 --> 00:25:35.487
Alice, you, back off.

00:25:35.716 --> 00:25:36.759
I'll kill her.

00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:39.449
No, I won't back off.

00:25:41.407 --> 00:25:45.251
I'm begging you, Mom. Don't do anything more wrong.

00:25:46.434 --> 00:25:49.782
Get out. Or I'll shoot you too.

00:25:50.287 --> 00:25:51.201
Go ahead, Mom.

00:25:53.399 --> 00:25:54.916
If Mom doesn't see me as a daughter,

00:25:56.526 --> 00:25:57.845
then Mom can shoot me.

00:25:59.201 --> 00:26:00.637
Are you threatening me?

00:26:01.554 --> 00:26:02.540
I'm not threatening.

00:26:04.384 --> 00:26:06.401
I'm begging you, Mom.

00:26:09.542 --> 00:26:10.241
Please.

00:26:12.034 --> 00:26:13.925
Would you really die for her?

00:26:15.028 --> 00:26:18.826
I'm your mother. You should be on my side.

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:25.470
How can I be on your side when you're doing something wrong?

00:26:26.443 --> 00:26:32.178
I'm your daughter. Shouldn't I be the one to change your mind?

00:26:36.123 --> 00:26:36.963
Never.

00:26:39.166 --> 00:26:43.125
That Phirom hurt me. He has to pay.

00:26:44.493 --> 00:26:48.224
But Mr. Phirom is already dead, Mom.

00:26:49.112 --> 00:26:52.847
But everything I did, I did for you, Alice.

00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:56.868
He took everything from you.

00:26:57.226 --> 00:27:01.660
Everything should be yours. You should hate them.

00:27:02.246 --> 00:27:06.844
But when Mom was with Mr. Phirom, weren't you living comfortably?

00:27:08.291 --> 00:27:09.769
What more do you want?

00:27:11.525 --> 00:27:13.154
Haven't you had enough?

00:27:14.244 --> 00:27:14.643
No.

00:27:15.466 --> 00:27:16.496
I'm not satisfied.

00:27:18.127 --> 00:27:20.721
I'll take every baht, every satang.

00:27:22.246 --> 00:27:23.938
That Patty must die.

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:32.944
Mom!

00:27:33.563 --> 00:27:34.296
Mom!

00:27:34.818 --> 00:27:35.542
Mom!

00:27:37.277 --> 00:27:38.620
No, Mom!

00:27:40.312 --> 00:27:40.973
Mom!

00:27:47.056 --> 00:27:49.066
Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere?

00:27:49.373 --> 00:27:50.534
I'm fine. I'm okay.

00:27:51.209 --> 00:27:52.194
Mom.

00:27:56.174 --> 00:27:58.453
I'm sorry for hurting everyone.

00:27:59.136 --> 00:28:01.626
And I have to apologize to you too, Achi.

00:28:02.072 --> 00:28:03.003
What are you talking about?

00:28:03.702 --> 00:28:05.129
If I hadn't done this,

00:28:05.954 --> 00:28:09.917
I might not have found out who was really behind this case.

00:28:10.376 --> 00:28:12.321
Did it have to go this far?

00:28:12.792 --> 00:28:13.967
You don't understand, Achi.

00:28:15.003 --> 00:28:15.786
Anyway,

00:28:15.976 --> 00:28:19.209
I'm going to call the police and an ambulance first.

00:28:24.632 --> 00:28:26.022
My mother is dead.

00:28:27.133 --> 00:28:28.974
I have no one left.

00:28:28.974 --> 00:28:30.683
I have no one left. I have no one left. I have no one left.

00:28:30.683 --> 00:28:32.054
I have no one left. I have no one left.

00:28:33.917 --> 00:28:35.201
Don't say that.

00:28:37.921 --> 00:28:39.512
You still have me.

00:28:39.782 --> 00:28:41.344
Alice still has Chama.

00:28:48.696 --> 00:28:50.291
From now on,

00:28:50.296 --> 00:28:54.569
wherever there's Alice, there will be Chama.

00:28:57.908 --> 00:29:01.234
And what's your purpose for coming back this time?

00:29:01.504 --> 00:29:03.247
Well, I have to...

The case has been closed successfully.

00:29:38.114 --> 00:29:39.794
For the major national news story,

00:29:39.804 --> 00:29:41.397
where criminals in black clothing

00:29:41.407 --> 00:29:45.608
on motorcycles ambushed and shot Mr. Phirom Siwatchaponkonkai to death,

00:29:45.709 --> 00:29:47.999
last night after the incident,

00:29:48.004 --> 00:29:50.471
Police Captain Natee, or Inspector Tee,

00:29:50.524 --> 00:29:53.844
led patrol forces to investigate and track down

00:29:53.854 --> 00:29:56.046
the hiding place,

00:29:56.056 --> 00:30:00.277
and found that the criminals had kidnapped Patty and her close friend

00:30:00.287 --> 00:30:03.271
to an abandoned warehouse in Pathum Thani.

00:30:03.313 --> 00:30:08.534
In the end, all the men in black along with Mrs. Pin Saengchan Thanluan, the new wife,

00:30:08.544 --> 00:30:10.656
were captured by Inspector Tee, who suspects that

00:30:10.666 --> 00:30:15.376
Mrs. Pin Saengchan Thanluan was likely the one who ordered everyone killed

00:30:15.498 --> 00:30:18.492
hoping for the family inheritance of over a billion baht.

00:30:18.494 --> 00:30:19.764
About Patty.

00:30:19.854 --> 00:30:22.871
She hasn't gone back abroad yet. What are you going to do?

00:30:25.241 --> 00:30:28.888
Don't worry. It's not over yet.

00:30:30.142 --> 00:30:32.454
Because I have a second plan waiting for them.

00:30:32.761 --> 00:30:34.176
Want to know what the plan is?

00:30:35.444 --> 00:30:36.349
I do.

00:30:49.713 --> 00:30:52.025
- Hello.
- Hello. Checking in?

00:30:52.035 --> 00:30:53.700
Yes, room 601.

00:30:53.704 --> 00:30:56.677
May I have your ID card or passport, please?

00:30:59.584 --> 00:31:01.578
- Hello.
- Hello. Checking in?

00:31:01.588 --> 00:31:02.404
Room 602.

00:31:02.414 --> 00:31:04.324
Sure, may I have your ID card or passport, please?

00:31:04.334 --> 00:31:05.225
Chama!

00:31:06.681 --> 00:31:07.616
Achi!

00:31:11.372 --> 00:31:13.267
Tell me, what are you doing here?

00:31:13.709 --> 00:31:15.246
I came to take care of business.

00:31:15.334 --> 00:31:18.277
Does Chama have to report everything to Achi?

00:31:20.164 --> 00:31:21.107
But,

00:31:21.267 --> 00:31:24.340
did Achi come here to meet someone?

00:31:25.212 --> 00:31:26.079
No.

00:31:26.256 --> 00:31:28.206
I just came to hang out.

00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:31.044
You look very free.

00:31:31.907 --> 00:31:33.111
But you,

00:31:33.385 --> 00:31:35.881
you didn't come here to secretly follow me, did you?

00:31:36.829 --> 00:31:38.201
No way.

00:31:38.204 --> 00:31:39.949
I don't like you anymore, Achi.

00:31:40.227 --> 00:31:42.467
So stop being so confident.

00:31:43.191 --> 00:31:43.852
Gosh!

00:31:49.515 --> 00:31:53.182
And why are you making that pouty face? What's wrong?

00:31:53.465 --> 00:31:54.601
Heartbroken?

00:31:55.410 --> 00:31:56.841
What heartbreak?

00:31:57.869 --> 00:31:58.976
But,

00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:00.349
have you seen Alice?

00:32:00.622 --> 00:32:03.313
Well... I've seen her a bit.

00:32:03.839 --> 00:32:05.584
Really? Where?

00:32:06.244 --> 00:32:08.951
And Achi, have you seen Patty?

00:32:09.317 --> 00:32:11.364
No, I haven't seen her at all.

00:32:11.584 --> 00:32:14.745
It's been so long. Don't you miss each other at all?

00:32:15.111 --> 00:32:16.867
My heart is completely broken.

00:32:21.945 --> 00:32:22.690
Achi!

00:32:24.025 --> 00:32:24.959
Achi!

00:32:26.374 --> 00:32:27.184
Achi!

00:32:29.342 --> 00:32:30.349
Hello, Achi.

00:32:30.354 --> 00:32:32.492
Alice, sit down first.

00:32:42.142 --> 00:32:43.620
What is Alice doing here?

00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:46.555
Well... came to see Chama.

00:32:48.784 --> 00:32:52.542
A little reserved, that's okay.

00:32:57.469 --> 00:32:59.650
And did Alice come alone?

00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:01.389
No.

00:33:03.069 --> 00:33:05.785
I came with Chama.

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:12.399
So what about you two?

00:33:13.692 --> 00:33:14.774
Are you dating now?

00:33:18.964 --> 00:33:22.462
Well... I think so.

00:33:25.254 --> 00:33:28.029
Um, Achi, want to have dinner together?

00:33:29.145 --> 00:33:31.869
No thanks, I can smell the romance.

00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:36.286
Then... shall we go?

00:33:36.934 --> 00:33:39.376
Yeah, I'll go first, Achi.

00:33:41.296 --> 00:33:43.161
Enjoy your meal.

00:34:09.919 --> 00:34:11.397
May I sit with you?

00:34:16.467 --> 00:34:17.355
Senior.

00:34:21.801 --> 00:34:22.993
Junior.

00:34:30.176 --> 00:34:31.759
From now on...

00:34:31.764 --> 00:34:35.984
Wherever there's Alice, there will be Chama.

00:34:36.344 --> 00:34:38.644
Chama-Alice.

00:34:39.545 --> 00:34:41.584
Alice-Chama.

00:34:46.555 --> 00:34:47.431
Fine.

00:36:35.584 --> 00:36:41.014
So in this story, I was the one who got fooled from start to finish?

00:36:42.433 --> 00:36:44.896
Huh! Who fooled you?

00:36:45.582 --> 00:36:48.784
Alice or Chama?

00:36:49.755 --> 00:36:50.959
I'll deal with them for you.

00:36:51.924 --> 00:36:53.304
You.

00:36:54.109 --> 00:36:54.715
Huh!

00:36:55.233 --> 00:36:56.332
Me?

00:36:57.591 --> 00:36:58.384
No way.

00:36:59.633 --> 00:37:00.631
Yes.

00:37:01.852 --> 00:37:05.284
So what was your purpose for coming back this time?

00:37:05.584 --> 00:37:09.532
Well... to see you.

00:37:13.069 --> 00:37:16.384
Then... let me ask one more question.

00:37:18.033 --> 00:37:21.313
Do you love me, or are you deceiving me?

00:37:23.157 --> 00:37:25.237
Well, I have to...

00:37:27.528 --> 00:37:28.500
Love you!

00:38:50.624 --> 00:38:51.915
Please don't be angry at us.

00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:54.707
We had to do it this way.

00:38:55.919 --> 00:38:57.060
Yeah, it was necessary.

00:38:58.336 --> 00:38:59.044
It's my fault.

00:38:59.404 --> 00:39:00.479
I misspoke.

00:39:01.624 --> 00:39:02.534
Please.

00:39:04.858 --> 00:39:10.624
How did you feel just now when you confessed your love and she caught on?

00:39:10.634 --> 00:39:12.784
I thought that all this time...

00:39:12.854 --> 00:39:15.246
I've been playing it cool. It wasn't that obvious, was it?

00:39:15.424 --> 00:39:18.224
Even though my look might not be ladylike,

00:39:19.624 --> 00:39:21.675
Chama, you watch Patty. I'll be right back.

00:39:22.324 --> 00:39:22.993
Wait!

00:39:31.839 --> 00:39:33.022
What just fell?

00:39:33.342 --> 00:39:33.911
A gun!

00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:38.871
I saw it earlier. It fell down.

00:39:39.477 --> 00:39:40.437
Fell down to the butt.

00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:42.395
Nobody cares at all.

00:39:43.077 --> 00:39:45.460
Move, move, move. Didn't hit. Didn't hit.

00:39:45.464 --> 00:39:46.075
1, 2, 3!

00:39:53.494 --> 00:39:54.555
You can be loose about it.

00:39:55.321 --> 00:39:57.490
It's like... and the pose is quite cool actually.

00:39:57.999 --> 00:40:00.037
And I'm really going to wear these shoes too.

00:40:00.047 --> 00:40:02.749
Should you take these? No, no.

00:40:13.854 --> 00:40:15.244
Go.

00:40:15.254 --> 00:40:17.452
Alice finally arrived. You took so long.

00:40:18.298 --> 00:40:19.410
Slept and dreamed twice before waking up.

00:40:20.504 --> 00:40:21.224
So chill.

00:40:21.225 --> 00:40:23.170
I don't even know how to sleep anymore at this point.

00:40:23.304 --> 00:40:25.024
Wipe your face. Wipe your face.

00:40:30.366 --> 00:40:31.326
I'm going to shoot them.

00:40:31.444 --> 00:40:32.366
I'm going to shoot them.

00:40:32.942 --> 00:40:34.184
No, they're sleepy already.

00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:36.062
They've been playing for a long time. They want to sleep.

00:40:36.064 --> 00:40:37.199
But you're so fresh.

00:40:37.424 --> 00:40:38.201
Let them die. I want to sleep.

00:40:46.648 --> 00:40:51.372
MISSION LOVE OR LIES THE SERIES - Wrapped!

00:40:51.374 --> 00:40:54.576
Yay!!!
