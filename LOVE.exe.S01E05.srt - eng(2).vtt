Hello. My name is Im Yoo Ri.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.140
I'm the former student president for Modelling.

I'm Kang Dong Won. CompSci's former student president.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.780
We've seen each other around a few times, right?

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.450
Well, we do go to the same school.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.490
Okay, let's review the agenda for today's emergency meeting.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.990
First off, until the re-election for the Integrated Studies' Council,

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.690
per the bylaws, the Student Council will act as an Emergency Committee.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.070
We'll be handling academic matters, especially freshman events.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.330
Our CompSci Emergency Committee...

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.539
How about we just call it the Mo-Comp Committee?

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:38.770
We have a re-election soon anyway.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.610
But the administration might think we're in favour of the merger.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.850
But if we're divided, we'll confuse the freshmen and hurt operations.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.020
Doubling staff per department seems like a bit much.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.550
Okay.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.690
First, let's elect the joint Mo-Comp Emergency Committee.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.830
(Modelling and CompSci Election!)

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.740
Then it's settled. This committee will lead the school through March.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.840
Well, for starters, the CompSci and Modelling departments...

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.439
have already made numerous complaints...

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.809
- about the shared space. - It's supposed to be...

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.480
the Mo-Comp Student Council Room now,

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.320
but it seems the CompSci students still treat it as their own space.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.590
I've heard they make our students feel uncomfortable and unwelcome.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.030
But you can't really blame them. It used to be their own space...

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.029
But we're an integrated school now.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.830
It's a shared Mo-Comp space, right?

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.070
Fine. I get it.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.569
We need a smart way...

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.510
to divide the Comp-Mo space to avoid conflicts...

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.110
So the Mo-Comp Emergency Committee we elect today will decide, right?

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.110
I wonder who'll be the Comp-Mo Emergency Committee Chairman.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.609
The Mo-Comp Committee Chairman.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.020
Does the order really matter?

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.550
Let's just go with Mo-Comp, then. It's alphabetical in Korean.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.920
Well, in the English alphabet, C comes before M.

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.020
- But we're in Korea. - English is the global standard.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.290
Oh my, look at Ms. Global Standard.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.060
For the first item on the agenda, the Comp-Mo...

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.030
Mo-Comp?

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.800
We will begin the election for the joint Comp-Mo-Comp Committee.

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.870
- This connection we finally made... - Two.

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.080
I feel like I've completely ruined it.

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.010
Hey, don't stress out too much.

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.350
You'll lose your gains.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.780
Alright, pack your shoulders.

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.020
Girls are so hard to figure out.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.490
I just don't get it anymore.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.160
Dude, if even you're saying that, what hope do the rest of us have?

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:41.960
Still, I think she went too far.

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.500
It's not like I could've known everything she was going through.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.800
Come on, focus on your workout.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.930
But I was sincere about wanting to do the group project with her.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:49.330
Alright, enough.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:52.900
But, hey...

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.040
Do you think a guy like me...

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.140
can ever be someone worthwhile, someone people will remember?

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.249
Someday?

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.380
Seriously, stop. That's ridiculous.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.880
- What? - You're already...

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.289
so popular, getting all this attention,

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.520
and everyone adores you.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:11.960
Right?

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:14.760
You wouldn't get it.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.460
Times like this make me think of my grandpa.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.830
Hey there, handsome. Have a piece of candy.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.970
You're so handsome.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.540
- Min Hak. - Yes?

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:30.610
Give me that candy.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.280
Now.

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.349
Why? You got it for free anyway.

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:38.550
Why are you picking on a kid?

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:44.620
Here, take it.

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.530
Min Hak, your face is just like that piece of candy.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.040
You were given your looks for free, but nothing in life is free.

No bee ever looks for a wilted flower.

Thanks, you guys. I wasn't expecting this at all.

Gosh, one million. My friend's a mega-celebrity.

Here we go.

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:01.980
- Okay. - You can do this.

Don't you think it's a trap? Is that even possible...

for me to get it three times in a row?

There are seven here. And nine over there.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.500
You're always busy shooting videos and taking photos.

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:54.200
The lighting's better for you over here.

When you're filming and taking photos,

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:58.839

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.100

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:04.039
do you really need them?

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.240
Do you want to switch?

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:07.039
- Yes. - Then...

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.680
ask me nicely.

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:10.149
- What was that? - Go on.

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:12.880
"Please let us switch, Madam Chair."

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:15.120
This is an abuse of power.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.150
You'd better watch it before I have you impeached.

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:20.090
Fine. You have one hour to clear out all the CompSci stuff.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.860
Speak for yourself. When your welcome assembly is over,

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:25.130
you'd better clean up without leaving a single trace.

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.160
This is why we should've just done it together.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.729
We're people who value a noble cause...

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:30.900
over fleeting pleasures.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Let's go, guys.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.440
And by the way, even though we split the official titles,

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:38.839
this whole "Madam Chair" and "Vice-Chair" thing...

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.910
is childish and a bit cringey.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:43.010
Can we just use our names from now on?

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:45.920
No. I quite like it this way.

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:48.250
It's authoritative. The hierarchy is clear.

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:52.890
- Groups of four. - We're running out of time!

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:56.730
(Hangang University)

00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:58.600
What about her?

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:00.399
Pyongyang Sci and Tech, CompSci grad.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.500
She placed in a hacking competition.

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:06.340
They say she banned the accounts using macros for class registration.

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:09.610
If we do a cybersecurity project, it would look great on our resumes.

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:14.110
We'll split any prize money evenly, of course.

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:16.649
We'll divide the work equally...

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:19.250
- so you're not stuck doing it all. - Equally?

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.050
You mean, communist-style?

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:24.620
What? Is that because I'm from Pyongyang?

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.159
Anyway, sorry.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.260
I've already teamed up with Ban Ji No.

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:32.130
He said he was all about a performance-based split.

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:37.470
As a business double major, you know what's marketable.

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:40.670
That's crucial. The business plan is worth a lot.

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:43.169
We'll provide solid tech support...

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:44.610
if you can write the business plan.

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:46.780
- Wouldn't that be the perfect team? - The three of you?

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:49.180
Okay, I'm in.

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:50.649
But on Yong Seok's team,

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:51.979
they said if the project went commercial,

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:53.520
the equity split would be 4-2-2-2.

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:55.620
They're giving me the 40 percent. What about you?

00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:56.950
What's your offer?

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:59.320
This sounds fun. Who cares if we don't win?

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:01.930
I get something for my resume, too. It's a win-win.

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:03.260
Really? It'd be great to work with...

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:05.000
Should we start with the logo design?

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.460
Maybe for today, we could just grab a bite...

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:09.000
When it comes to logo design, on freelance sites like Kmong,

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:10.969
I usually get paid 200 dollar per design.

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:13.000
Photoshop edits start at 50 dollars.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:17.480
But since we go to the same school, I won't charge you the full amount.

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:23.480
Hey! You're a double major too, right?

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:25.520
Sorry. I'm teaming up with my girlfriend.

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:27.950
- He's not even listening. - A girlfriend?

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:29.850
You have a girlfriend?

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:35.430
When did that happen?

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.170
Getting serious sponsored-item vibes from your outfit today.

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:45.100
Here. Check it out.

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:48.270
Okay. A 45-degree angle.

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:50.370
Perfect.

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.040
Hey, is it super obvious there are no lenses in these?

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:55.109
You just need to post it on Instagram.

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:56.350
You don't actually have to wear them.

00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:58.320
It's completely empty.

00:12:58.880 --> 00:12:59.880
Just like me.

00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:01.950
What's that supposed to mean?

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:04.920
Anyway, what about that Quiz King girl?

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:06.660
Did you ask her again?

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:08.860
She said she didn't want to team up.

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:11.060
- Why? - I don't know.

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:14.730
So I just decided to team up with someone else.

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:17.130
A guy named Ban Ji No.

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:21.740
Are we done for? Is this for real?

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:22.870
Yes.

00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:24.840
Yes, my buddy, Min Hak.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:28.950
Your schedule is pretty packed.

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:30.610
Since when are they such good friends?

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:31.849
It's fine.

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:33.850
You're a huge celebrity, after all.

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:36.190
We'll handle everything behind the scenes.

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:37.760
Because we're a team.

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:40.160
Hey, what's going on? Are they a team now?

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:41.230
Let's do this, guys!

00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:45.259
Most of you have formed your teams.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.060
If there is anyone who still needs a team,

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:49.230
they need to email the TA by tonight.

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:53.100
Otherwise, we'll assign you randomly. All right.

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:57.310
And I have one more announcement.

00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:58.580
Our class...

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:01.850
for the Converged Physical whatever-it-is department...

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:04.650
has been selected as its representative course.

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:09.490
I believe I covered its connection to the competition last class.

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:14.360
And it seems there's a commendation from the Ministry of Education.

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:20.330
Basically, a way to quiet students and avoid a Ministry audit.

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:22.170
A one-off, face-saving competition.

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:26.000
For better or for worse, right?

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:27.740
You can take it from here.

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:30.569
We've received external funding,

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:32.910
so the prize is up by 10,000 dollars.

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.510
For a total prize of 30,000 dollars.

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:35.910
Thirty thousand dollars?

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:38.650
In exchange, judging now includes global communication...

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.720
and proactive engagement.

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:43.749
What do we mean by that?

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:45.960
Well, the prospective end users,

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:48.090
the public, their opinions matter.

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:51.400
They want something with broad appeal outside the campus.

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.660
What? So it's basically just a popularity contest?

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:55.899
Questions go on the forum.

00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:58.170
Suggestions go to the department.

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.640
Do not come see me or contact me personally.

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:02.970
If first place gets 30,000 dollars,

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:05.140
what about second place?

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:09.410
A flash drive. Featuring the university's logo.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.080
A one-terabyte flash drive.

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:13.720
Seriously? Can the gap between first and second place be that huge?

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:16.150
- Kang Min Hak! - Sub him out!

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:17.759
Hey, Kang Min Hak.

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:19.560
He's surprisingly diligent at school.

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:23.160
I know, right? I thought he'd be too busy for classes.

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:26.600
He'll probably stand by the goal, use face mist, and go live.

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:30.170
Yeon San, you're really taking this grudge way too far.

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.500
So what's the plan?

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:35.010
Should we ask Kang Min Hak now?

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:36.670
We can change teams until tonight.

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:38.410
Joo Yeon San has her pride, you know.

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:40.140
Who cares about pride right now?

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:43.550
If Ban Ji No gets Kang Min Hak, we don't stand a chance.

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:45.950
There's a flaw in your logic.

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:48.020
Kang Min Hak has a million followers.

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:52.490
The current population of South Korea is 51,751,065.

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:55.690
If we limit the population pool to just the citizens of South Korea,

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:58.060
that means about two percent of them follow Kang Min Hak.

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:00.259
The Comp Sci Dept has 120 students.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.670
If two percent of them follow him,

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:04.400
that's barely 2.4 students.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.239
In other words,

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:09.040
in the user vote, he isn't as valuable as you think.

00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:11.540
Let's just find someone else.

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:14.110
Something seems off about your math.

00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:15.350
How sharp of you.

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:18.550
And yes, many are international,

00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:21.750
I just took that population completely out of the denominator.

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:24.190
If anything, I overestimated his worth.

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:26.690
Still, he's not much of a catch.

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.830
That's Joo Yeon San for you.

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:31.059
Enough talk.

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:33.000
Let's just go ask a random Hangang University student.

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:37.870
Excuse me!

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:41.140
Quick, name the first student who comes to mind.

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:43.640
Kang Min Hak?

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:48.850
All right, let's go.

00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:50.910
Hey, defence!

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:54.020
- Cover your man! - Pass!

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:55.550
- Defence! - Hold on.

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:57.120
Nice shot!

00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:00.220
Why is humanity so drawn to such superficial flashiness?

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:01.290
Get the board!

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:03.729
In sexual selection,

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:06.729
a doe prefers a stag with big, impressive antlers,

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:08.300
and a peahen is drawn to a peacock with magnificent tail feathers.

00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:09.670
That's just how they pick a mate.

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:11.840
That's exactly my point. How inefficient is that?

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:14.640
What good are big, beautiful antlers when it comes to survival?

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:16.039
They get in the way and are cumbersome.

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:17.440
I mean, look at peacocks.

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:18.879
Despite their magnificent feathers,

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.710
to predators like leopards and eagles,

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:21.809
they just make them stand out.

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:23.610
So why do humans, advanced primates,

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:25.579
make the same irrational choices...

00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:27.350
you'd expect from a deer or a peacock?

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:28.789
She has no clue what she's saying.

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:30.290
Should I really school her?

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:36.890
While they may look magnificent to human eyes,

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:40.459
to a predator like a leopard,

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:42.100
a peacock's feathers look like this.

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:45.070
A peacock's primary habitat is the dense, overgrown jungle.

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.769
So their colours aren't a handicap.

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:49.110
They're actually camouflage.

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:52.009
It's not that a peahen chooses a male...

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:53.680
with a magnificent pattern...

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:54.950
simply because she finds it beautiful.

00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:58.380
The colours that the peacock flaunts to its predators...

00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:00.120
just appear dull and drab.

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:02.050
Right.

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:04.790
I guess that makes Joo Yeon San a predator, then?

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:05.960
One more thing.

00:18:05.961 --> 00:18:09.659
You called them "tail feathers."

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:11.460
But that expression is incorrect.

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.259
They're not tail feathers, and not wing feathers either.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:15.430
To be precise,

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:17.730
they're feathers that grow from its lower back.

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:19.940
And you are...

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:22.569
Just a life sciences student.

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:24.640
Seeing such ignorance of biology...

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:26.110
especially engineering students like you,

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.109
I couldn't help but step in.

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:30.010
Sorry, I'm just rambling.

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.080
Well, then.

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:35.450
Nice!

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:37.990
- One more basket to go. - If we make one more.

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:39.090
Play defence! It's game point!

00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:40.560
Just block them!

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:41.890
Hun Gyu!

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:46.660
Hey!

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:51.140
Even if I'm the one who scores,

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:53.000
who's really going to care?

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:55.340
But I don't want to lose.

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:58.980
I've been training each night.

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:00.540
Here I go.

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:03.479
After using my vet moves to shake off...

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:04.980
Kang Min Hak, the alpha male,

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:07.520
the moment I sink a beautiful clutch shot,

00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:10.290
my classmates will finally notice me.

00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:13.359
Maybe that one moment of impact...

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.890
could be my first shot at romance.

00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:20.500
That's right. I've trained so hard for this.

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:22.500
Right now.

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:52.060
Oh my.

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:53.900
Nice.

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:55.630
Unreal.

00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:58.800
He's better than I expected.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:02.670
It's amazing. He scores, and the dark clouds part.

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:04.410
Even the dark clouds are parting.

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:06.980
Joo Yeon San.

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:09.010
You have to be the one to do it.

00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:12.220
If you want to get technical, you're his first love, aren't you?

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:14.349
The girl from his childhood?

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:15.620
For a guy, that's a huge deal.

00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:17.920
All right, let's just vote on it. Majority rules.

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:20.120
Majority rule is a form of tyranny.

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:23.360
Democracy has always been built on that kind of violence, sweetie.

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:25.229
All in favour of Kang Min Hak joining,

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:26.259
raise your hand.

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:27.260
Me.

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:29.570
Sorry, So Yeon's calling.

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:33.440
Sorry, it looks more fun over there. I'm out.

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:34.500
What?

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:41.810
(Men's restroom)

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:46.080
Kang Min Hak.

00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:49.150
Got a minute?

00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:51.990
- We'll go on ahead. - Yes, go on.

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:54.260
Sure.

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:58.430
I'll get straight to the point. I want you on our team.

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:03.700
But I already promised Ji No I'd be on his team.

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:05.440
Why all of a sudden?

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:07.870
I want to apologise. I was out of line.

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:11.640
So I've been trying to figure out how to fix things.

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:13.410
And I realised you don't need anything.

00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:16.150
I had nothing to offer you.

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:20.180
All I can offer are meal vouchers and printing credits,

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:21.389
but you've got...

00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:24.290
plenty of money, and people will buy you food anyway.

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.520
But I did notice you're very busy.

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:27.920
Which means...

00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:30.030
the most important thing to you is your time.

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:34.670
So here's my offer.

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.529
Join us, and you won't have to work.

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:39.640
The three of us will do everything,

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:41.640
and you just help promote it later.

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:44.040
Of course, if we do end up winning,

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:46.239
we'll split the prize money evenly.

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:49.349
And even if we don't win, don't worry about your grade.

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:52.320
I have an A plus in all my majors.

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.180
Also, Yang Na Rae...

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:57.149
did offer up her studio apartment...

00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:59.320
as our meeting space,

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:01.960
but I guess that's not really a selling point.

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:04.699
Let me know if you need anything else.

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:06.130
I'll talk it over with my friends,

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:08.030
and we'll do our best to meet your terms.

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:11.270
So this time,

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:13.900
you just need me for window dressing.

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:15.440
What?

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:17.170
I appreciate the offer.

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:20.010
But I'll stick with Ban Ji No's team.

00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:22.009
Why? What did Ji No say?

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:23.110
Did he offer a stake in his company?

00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:25.849
Or his uncle at a big tech company?

00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:27.150
Did he say he'd pull some strings?

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:29.650
No, Ban Ji No didn't say anything like that.

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:31.049
Then what?

00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:33.120
He said the team really needed me.

00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:38.330
I have to get to my next class.

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:40.500
I've got to go.

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:42.470
Hey.

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:47.439
- You can head on in this way. - Dong Won.

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:48.710
What do we do? No one's here.

00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:50.740
What else is new?

00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:53.440
I sent out the notice, but...

00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:56.010
Dong Won, should we push it back 30 minutes?

00:22:58.050 --> 00:23:00.150
Let's just start. We're starting now.

00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:04.690
All right, let's get the semester's first general meeting started.

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:07.889
First, the department space issue.

00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:09.090
For heaven's sake.

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:12.699
It's wonderful to see our students...

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:14.560
gathered here like this.

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:20.039
I know your time is precious,

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:22.510
so I'll get straight to the point.

00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:24.239
The Hangang University President's Cup...

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:26.640
Software Convergence Tech Contest.

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:30.010
We already know that the prize is now 30,000 dollars.

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:35.290
It's their way of using chump change to shut the students up...

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:37.019
and avoid a Ministry of Education audit...

00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:38.960
with a face-saving competition.

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:41.530
So you've heard.

00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:44.060
Actually, there's one more thing.

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:46.359
True to our name, Convergence Studies,

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:48.430
each team needs a modelling student.

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:50.770
At least one, to be exact.

00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:52.840
In return, the winning team...

00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:58.510
will receive an internship at a leading U.S. tech company.

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:00.609
And that's not all.

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:03.210
We'll also cover round-trip flights...

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:05.920
and accommodations.

00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:09.220
We really should've gotten Kang Min Hak.

00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:11.350
But why do we have to team up with a Modelling Major?

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:13.219
First, they said anyone could join.

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:16.129
It's just another school deception.

00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:17.829
Dean, please elaborate on the issue...

00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:18.960
of allocating more space for our department,

00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:21.199
how the merger budget savings were used,

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:23.199
and the increase scholarships.

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:24.230
We would like to know more.

00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:29.510
I knew it was just a stepping stone.

00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:30.710
I shouldn't expect anything from it.

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:34.880
All right, mind the spacing of your steps.

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:36.710
Heads up high. That's it.

00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:38.850
A class for Modelling Majors?

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:42.050
Your eyeline. That last pose was great.

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:43.750
Watch your stride.

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:46.120
(Dept. of Converged Physical Tech and Global Content Development)

00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:48.360
- They seem to be working hard. - Keep coming, straight on.

00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:50.690
- But how can... - Great eyeline.

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:53.030
Walking on two feet be a college class?

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:54.359
Drop your left shoulder.

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:56.199
- And pose. - Why do we have to learn...

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:58.240
- once again the universal traits... - Two, three.

00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:00.500
That distinguish humans from other primates?

00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:05.910
And yet...

00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:13.280
What is beauty?

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:16.290
(Department of Modelling, Class in progress)

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:19.260
Okay.

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:22.730
So elegant.

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:24.859
To some,

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:27.360
just by merely existing, they can absorb nutrients,

00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:31.470
achieve professional value,

00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:37.840
and even to procreate.

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:43.649
An absurdly powerful advantage that takes care of everything,

00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:45.620
from survival to self-fulfilment, even reproduction.

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:49.690
Maybe that’s the ideal humans have been chasing...

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:52.089
ever since we left hunting and gathering behind...

00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:53.660
and entered the fourth industrial age?

00:25:57.890 --> 00:25:59.400
Can you believe this weather? It's only week two.

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:01.130
Welcome to Gyeonggi Province.

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:02.970
The biting wind on the outskirts of the capital region.

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:06.740
Why isn't Joo Yeon San picking up? The shuttle line is getting long.

00:26:11.910 --> 00:26:13.210
I'm at the Converged Tech lounge.

00:26:14.010 --> 00:26:15.480
What's Joo Yeon San doing there?

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:18.680
But isn't the Department of Modelling having their kick-off party today?

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:25.190
They turned the Comp-Eng hallway into a club in just half a day?

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:28.020
Make some noise!

00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:29.760
(Dept. of Converged Physical Tech and Global Content Development)

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:31.130
(Congratulations on the New Department)

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.800
Min Hak, just focus on the ideas. I'll handle making them a reality.

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:40.270
Ideas?

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.610
So, what's been on your mind lately?

00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:46.610
The best ideas are the ones that solve real-life problems.

00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:51.480
I guess, fine dust.

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:55.190
- Fine dust. - It's a problem every spring,

00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:57.090
It'd be great if an app could...

00:26:57.290 --> 00:26:59.690
auto-purify the air around you.

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:03.530
And one more thing. UV rays are also a concern.

00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:05.530
So you wouldn't have to bother putting on sunscreen,

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:08.730
what if there was an app that could just block UV rays?

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:09.800
I see.

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:14.700
Sharing our thoughts like this, I feel like we've gotten closer.

00:27:14.770 --> 00:27:17.540
- Hey, Min Hak bro, what's up? - Hey!

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:22.850
Excuse me, but would you mind removing your hand?

00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:34.190
(Hangang University)

00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:38.430
This way?

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:41.870
I'm going dark tomorrow.

00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:44.429
- Kang Dong Won. - Dong Won?

00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:45.570
As in Kang Dong Won?

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:47.600
Quick, hide!

00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:51.570
Stop the department merger!

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:53.079
- Stop it! - Stop it!

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:54.740
Some Semester Kick-off this is.

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:56.410
- Some Semester Kick-off this is. - Some Semester Kick-off this is.

00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:58.350
- Stop it! - Stop it!

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:00.150
Dong Won?

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:02.350
Fancy seeing you here. What brings you here?

00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:07.390
We just couldn't stand by and let this happen.

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:09.530
I see. Right.

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:15.000
- This is a Chaotic General Meeting! - It's a Chaotic General Meeting!

00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:16.770
- This is a Chaotic General Meeting! - This is a Chaotic General Meeting.

00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:18.169
- Do we have another chant? - Well...

00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:20.840
- Fellow students! - Wait. Why me?

00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:24.340
- Come on, just go with it. - Fellow students...

00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:27.580
Dong Hwan, do you have a new chant?

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:29.010
Actually, you guys,

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:32.380
instead of us just shouting into the void out here,

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:34.020
shouldn't we go inside...

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:35.790
- Go inside? - Inside?

00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:38.049
And try to get people on our side?

00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:39.420
Wouldn't that be more effective?

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:41.460
- She's right. - Exactly.

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:42.660
- That's the spirit. - That's the spirit.

00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:45.160
- Let's win them over! - Let's win them over!

00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:46.830
- Let's win them over! - Let's win them over!

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:49.130
(Dept. of Converged Physical Tech and Global Content Development)

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:50.300
(Semester's starting? Whatever, let's drink.)

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:51.370
(Semester Kick-off Party)

00:28:57.340 --> 00:28:59.210
Really? What's with them?

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:04.250
They should merge all the kick-offs.

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:06.280
Having them separately is a waste.

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:08.050
Let's go!

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:12.090
Where's Joo Yeon San?

00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:29.670
Kang Dong Won?

00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:32.680
Vice-Chair? What brings you here?

00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:34.510
I'm just looking for a friend.

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:38.410
And to win over some modelling majors to our Emergency Committee's cause.

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:43.450
No anti-merger shirt today? This look really suits you.

00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:45.890
(We want to code, not walk the runway.)

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:48.989
I can't just waltz into the lion's den.

00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:50.130
The lion's den?

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:53.500
Who in Modelling are you hitting on? Want my help?

00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:55.500
Not "hit on." I said "win over..."

00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:58.740
How about we just go our separate ways?

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:02.140
No. I'm enjoying talking with you, Vice-Chair.

00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:04.139
- For real? - I'm just sick of...

00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:05.980
the CompSci majors looking down on us modelling majors,

00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:08.650
and acting smug, so I'm actually picking a fight.

00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:10.380
I'm sorry about that.

00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:13.220
You're right. The merger isn't the Modelling Department's fault.

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:15.819
We're also collecting signatures.

00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:18.989
Seniors are swamped by Fashion Week.

00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:20.490
But I'll collect them and give them to you all at once.

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:24.930
So, does this mean we've made up?

00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:30.329
Unbelievable!

00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:32.500
CompSci majors took more lockers on the first floor.

00:30:32.670 --> 00:30:34.969
They took them all behind our back.

00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:36.040
What?

00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:39.539
Those weren't for every student.

00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:42.149
- They were for the CompSci Dept... - What are you talking about?

00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:44.480
- It belongs to the CompSci... - Busted!

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:47.020
- Joo Yeon San! - Kang Dong Won!

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:48.480
- Joo Yeon San! - Trying to run away?

00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:50.050
- Joo Yeon San! - Where are you going?

00:31:07.770 --> 00:31:08.810
Babe.

00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:11.310
Hey. You made it.

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:30.260
You just can't contain yourself, can you?

00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:50.610
Joo Yeon San. Leave it to you to kill the mood just by showing up.

00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:53.420
This vibe is killer!

00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:56.020
What are you doing here?

00:31:56.790 --> 00:31:58.050
I'm here to see you, Kang Min Hak.

00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:00.559
- What? - Don't tell me you're here...

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:01.790
for the Creative Integrated Design class.

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:03.760
I'm here for the Creative Integrated Design class.

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:07.430
No. Min Hak is on our team, and we've already gotten pretty far.

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:10.270
Min Hak, didn't Joo Yeon San say not to even show up for meetings?

00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:12.769
That would be completely ignoring the dean's intention...

00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:14.840
to foster global talent through interdisciplinary integration.

00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:16.739
I've been giving it a lot of thought.

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:18.139
Not just using your popularity...

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:20.509
- for the contest. - I'm a big fan. You're so handsome.

00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:22.280
I mean the real reason we actually need you on our team.

00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:25.380
Yeon San, I didn't quite catch that.

00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:26.719
Don't listen to her, Min Hak.

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:28.050
The important thing is your choice.

00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:32.060
I see your potential and skills. I value what you bring to the table.

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:33.759
Value?

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:35.990
What exactly is my potential?

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.130
Obviously, it's...

00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:41.460
And don't say that I'm handsome, tall, and popular.

00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:45.970
Right! That's not potential. Those are assets you already have.

00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:48.440
It's more of a passion?

00:32:48.810 --> 00:32:50.670
The friendship that's blossoming between us?

00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:55.410
Design.

00:32:58.180 --> 00:32:59.220
Design.

00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:01.650
- What? - The shell?

00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:02.820
No.

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:06.160
In UI design, it's not just a superficial shell.

00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:10.890
An intuitive, elegant UI in itself is a brilliant feature.

00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:13.730
But for people like me, that sense of design...

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:16.270
that way of thinking is what I lack.

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:18.599
That's why today's young audience...

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:20.400
has gone so wild for your...

00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:22.970
Let's go check that out.

00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:24.410
Let's go, man. What you think?

00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:27.839
- Let me go. What's your problem? - For your beauty.

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:29.780
- Relax! - That's what I need.

00:33:30.910 --> 00:33:33.620
- "Beauty"? - It's a polite way to say he's hot.

00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:36.420
That's an asset Min Hak knows he has.

00:33:36.850 --> 00:33:38.689
Min Hak, let's not waste any more time.

00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:40.690
The group's waiting... Hey, come on!

00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:43.190
No, the beauty I'm talking about is from a different perspective.

00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:45.330
What exactly is it that makes people...

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:48.660
drawn to high noses, sharp jaws, and physiques of guys like you?

00:33:48.730 --> 00:33:52.370
What's the algorithm in those lines that fascinates the human mind?

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:53.939
They're the same lines and curves,

00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:56.110
so why do we find Ban Ji No's boring?

00:33:56.170 --> 00:33:57.239
Hey!

00:33:57.240 --> 00:34:00.310
Min Hak, simply put, she's after your fame.

00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:01.880
And I'm just part of the scenery.

00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:04.950
- What's going on? - What is that?

00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:07.750
- No, that's not it. - This place is madness!

00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:08.820
It's curiosity!

00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:10.350
A spirit of inquiry!

00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:14.420
If we drop our preconceptions, we can access a larger data set.

00:34:14.490 --> 00:34:16.960
That spirit of inquiry makes me want to do this competition...

00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:22.060
I want to do it with you!

00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:26.800
He's got nice lines.

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:29.610
Gosh. I missed the object of the sentence.

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:40.650
- I love a public confession. - Keep rolling.

00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:44.320
What now? Is everyone really filming something like this?

00:34:44.650 --> 00:34:46.360
- What's going on? - She's got some nerve.

00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:47.890
That's how it's done lately.

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:49.930
- Yeon San, you're incredible. - So audacious.

00:34:49.990 --> 00:34:50.990
Joo Yeon San!

00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:52.629
- Hey! - She thinks you're amazing.

00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:53.929
- What now? - Tell them to stop filming.

00:34:53.930 --> 00:34:54.930
Right.

00:34:55.330 --> 00:34:56.330
Let's do it.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.170
- He said yes? - Joo Yeon San is something else.

00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:02.510
- She's lost her mind. - No, the group meeting!

00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:05.240
I meant the group meeting with you!

00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:06.840
I want to do the group meeting with you!

00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:07.980
Right, the group meeting.

00:35:08.110 --> 00:35:09.510
Let's do the group meeting together.

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:11.580
- What the heck? - I'm in. Let's do it.

00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:12.650
- A group meeting? - Is that all it was?

00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:14.220
- Kang Min Hak, no! - It's just the group meeting.

00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:15.850
- So they're going to be a team? - Hey, over here.

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:17.420
- Hey, for real! - Over here. Drinks!

00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:18.490
Get us drinks! Drinks!

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:20.360
Joo Yeon San is stealing what's mine again.

00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:22.859
Na Rae! He's doing it with us!

00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:24.890
Good. Now we can finally have fun.
